# Publication bias {#publication-bias}

\FloatBarrier  

To quantify asymmetry as visualized by the funnel plot, we ran Egger's regression test [@egger1997] following our pre-registration. The results are displayed in Table \@ref(tab:egger). The outcome variable in the Egger's regression test is the observed effect size divided by its standard error. The resulting value is a z-score, which tells us directly if an effect size is significant: If $z \geq 1.96$ or $z \leq -1.96$, we know that the effect is significant ($p < 0.05$). This outcome is regressed on the inverse of its standard error, a measure of precision, with higher values indicating higher precision [@harrer2021]. The coefficient of interest in the Egger's test is the intercept, i.e. the estimated z-score when precision (the predictor variable) is zero. Given a precision of 0, or an infinitely large standard error, we would expect a z-score scattered around 0. However, when the funnel plot is asymmetric, for example due to publication bias, we expect that small studies with very high effect sizes will be considerably over-represented in our data, leading to a surprisingly high number of low-precision studies with high z-values. Due to this distortion, the predicted value of y for zero precision will be considerably larger than zero, resulting in a significant intercept. However, just as asymmetries in the funnel plot can stem from sources of heterogeneity other than publication bias, a positive Egger’s regression is not proof for publication bias. In fact, because we had no a priori suspicion of publication bias - our outcomes have not been of the outcomes of interest in the original studies - we do not take the results of the Egger’s test as indicative of publication bias.
