## Abstract

How good are people at judging the veracity of news? We conducted a
systematic literature review and pre-registered meta-analysis of 173
effect sizes from 48 experimental papers evaluating accuracy ratings of
true and false news ($N_{participants}$ = 100777 from 30 countries
across 6 continents). We found that people rated true news as much more
accurate than false news (d = 1.01 \[0.9, 1.12\]) and were slightly
better at rating false news as false than at rating true news as true (d
= 0.28 \[0.2, 0.35\]). In other words, participants were able to discern
true from false news, and were slightly more skeptical than gullible.
The political concordance of the news had no effect on discernment, but
participants were more skeptical of politically discordant news. These
findings lend support to crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives, and
suggest that, to improve discernment, there is more room to increase the
acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of false news.

## How to download and replicate

To reproduce the findings and re-run the analysis, do the following:

1.  Download and install this repository. You can use GitHub to clone or
    fork the repository (see the green “Clone or download” button at the
    top of the GitHub page).
2.  Open `meta_news_judgement.Rproj` to open an [RStudio
    Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3.  Within the RStudio Project, open the `Pfander_Altay_2023.Rmd` file
    and run it.

For inspecting scripts directly on github, use the `.md` files. The
source code can be found in the `.Rmd` and `.R` files.

Please find the [session info below](#session-info).

## Files glossary

The `codebook.csv` contains all variables of our data set.

The `data/` folder contains the main data sets.

- `data/data.csv` is the raw, hand-coded data that we extracted from the
  original papers (which is not yet accessible since it contains data
  not only for control, but also treatment conditions, which are
  relevant for another, unfinished project.)
- `data/cleaned.csv` is a cleaned version of that raw data, where we
  change some variable names, recode values, and remove treatment
  conditions. The cleaning process is documented in the `cleaning.Rmd`
  file (but cannot be replicated at the moment since `data.csv` is not
  yet public).
- `data/individual_level_subset.csv` and
  `data/correlations_by_sample.csv` are generated by the
  `compute_correlation.R` script. The first contains individual level
  data from a subset of studies for which we calculated the summary
  statistics ourselves. The second contains the correlation values for
  true and false news ratings by samples for that subset. We use these
  values to obtain the average by-sample correlation to calculate our
  effect sizes.
- `data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries/` contains shape files from the
  Natural Earth project. We use the [“Admin 0 - Countries” 1:110m
  cultural
  shapefiles](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/)
  for maps.

The `functions/` folder contains functions that we rely upon in our
analysis scripts. To keep the `Pfander_Altay_2023.Rmd` document neat and
readable, we wrote all lengthy code bits as external functions.

The `literature_search/` folder documents our literature review -
`scopus.csv` and `google.csv` contain all results that popped up in our
two literature searches. - `inclusion_criteria.csv` contains a list of
our inclusion criteria - `prisma.csv` is generated by `prisma.Rmd` and
contains all the relevant information for filling out the PRISMA
flowchart (which we did by hand in a [template dowloaded
here](http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/FlowDiagram))

The `data_extraction.R` file contains the code to obtain summary
statistics from raw data studies. Once we calculated these summary
statistics, we entered them by hand into the the raw data spreadsheet
(`data/data.csv`). We do not publish the raw data from those studies
here, since they are already publicly available.

Files preceded by `appendix_*` contain appendices to the
`Pfander_Altay_2023.Rmd`. We stored them in seperate documents to keep
the `Pfander_Altay_2023.Rmd` document as short as possible.

Files preceded by `simulation_*` contain data scripts for generating and
analyzing simulated data. We simulated data help us clarify our
estimands and choose estimators before writing our pre-registration.

`preregistration.Rmd` contians the source file for our pre-registration
which can be found on the [OSF](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/SVC7U).

`bibliography.bib` contains all references and `nature.csl` the citation
formatting.

`images/` contains images used for this README file.
