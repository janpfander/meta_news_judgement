10.1037/xge0001395,gamified inoculation interventions do not improve discrimination between true and fake news: reanalyzing existing research with receiver operating characteristic analysis,"Gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve the detection of online misinformation are becoming increasingly prevalent. Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre–post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond “true” or “fake”) from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment).We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more “false” responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection. © 2023 American Psychological Association",
10.23860/JMLE-2023-15-2-5,filipino students' competency in evaluating digital media content credibility: 'beginning' to 'emerging' levels,"This study investigates Filipino students' reasoning competency levels in evaluating the credibility of digital media content and whether significant statistical differences exist in their competency by education status, sex, age group, Internet use, or geographical location. Four hundred twenty-four students representing the senior high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels responded to four modified versions of the Stanford History Education Group's civic online reasoning tasks. The study found that most students have 'beginning' competency levels in author-checking, fact-checking, and biaschecking but 'emerging' competency levels for image-checking. Younger students and those who spend more hours online have higher mean competency levels for verifying the authenticity of a social media page. Postgraduate students fared better in distinguishing facts from opinions in arguments, while students residing in the Masbate province consistently registered lower mean scores for author- and fact-checking. This study indicates the need to strengthen Filipino students' information/media literacy across educational levels. Copyright:  © 2023 Author(s).",
10.20473/rlj.V6-I2.2020.136-145,university students' ability in evaluating fake news on social media,"Background of the study: Social media has become a traffic information exchange for both true and false information. Therefore, social media users should not simply believe the information they received. This paper investigates the process of evaluating news on social media carried out by students in assessing the news they find on social media, and their ability to distinguish fact and false news. Purpose: It is to find out more about the process of students evaluating news on social media by assessing the news they found on social media, and how can they know which is the factual news and which is the fake news and the difference between them. Method: Qualitative research methods with a descriptive approach are used in this research. This research was conducted at Gadjah Mada University. The purposive sampling technique was chosen to be used in determining students. Findings: Overall, participants were able to identify almost all news articles. Participants are able to identify almost all factual news articles correctly and most fake news articles correctly. Only a small portion of all news articles cannot be correctly identified by participants. Participants are better to identify factual news than fake news. Conclusion: Although participants already have experienced finding fake news on social media and have self-taught knowledge about how to distinguish fake news from reliable news, there is no guarantee that they can tell the news article they got, fake or fact. The researcher wants to give advice to the academic library to provide training on the characteristics of reliable referral sources and to think critically in assessing information as part of student information literacy training. © 2020, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.
