10.1371/journal.pone.0294701,fakestack: hierarchical tri-bert-cnn-lstm stacked model for effective fake news detection,"False news articles pose a serious challenge in today’s information landscape, impacting public opinion and decision-making. Efforts to counter this issue have led to research in deep learning and machine learning methods. However, a gap exists in effectively using contextual cues and skip connections within models, limiting the development of comprehensive detection systems that harness contextual information and vital data propagation. Thus, we propose a model of deep learning, FakeStack, in order to identify bogus news accurately. The model combines the power of pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representation of Transformers (BERT) embeddings with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having skip convolution block and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model has been trained and tested on English fake news dataset, and various performance metrics were employed to assess its effectiveness. The results showcase the exceptional performance of FakeStack, achieving an accuracy of 99.74%, precision of 99.67%, recall of 99.80%, and F1-score of 99.74%. Our model’s performance was extended to two additional datasets. For the LIAR dataset, our accuracy reached 75.58%, while the WELFake dataset showcased an impressive accuracy of 98.25%. Comparative analysis with other baseline models, including CNN, BERT-CNN, and BERT-LSTM, further highlights the superiority of FakeStack, surpassing all models evaluated. This study underscores the potential of advanced techniques in combating the spread of false news and ensuring the dissemination of reliable information. © 2023 Keya et al.

10.1177/14782103221144480,religious instruction in the post-truth world: a critique of australia’s controversial religious instruction classes in public schools,"Even though religious schools are common in Australia, many government schools provide religious instruction (RI) classes. Religious instruction involves students being segregated into faith based groups so as to receive instruction in the beliefs and practices of one religion. This practice also occurs in many other countries. In Australia, the provision of RI in government schools has become increasingly controversial, resulting in numerous government reviews, law and policy changes and frequent media coverage. In this paper, I examine Australia’s RI laws, policies and other relevant literature. I argue that RI aims to indoctrinate. Consequently, it may conflict with educational efforts to combat the sorts of thinking and problems that characterise the ‘post-truth world’ – that is, a world flooded with disinformation, conspiratorial thinking and science denialism, which fosters social divisiveness and undermines effective responses to serious global problems (e.g. COVID-19, climate change). A more educational alternative to teaching about religions is recommended. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1038/s41598-024-54030-y,the persuasive effects of social cues and source effects on misinformation susceptibility,"Although misinformation exposure takes place within a social context, significant conclusions have been drawn about misinformation susceptibility through studies that largely examine judgements in a social vacuum. Bridging the gap between social influence research and the cognitive science of misinformation, we examine the mechanisms through which social context impacts misinformation susceptibility across 5 experiments (N = 20,477). We find that social cues only impact individual judgements when they influence perceptions of wider social consensus, and that source similarity only biases news consumers when the source is high in credibility. Specifically, high and low engagement cues (‘likes’) reduced misinformation susceptibility relative to a control, and endorsement cues increased susceptibility, but discrediting cues had no impact. Furthermore, political ingroup sources increased susceptibility if the source was high in credibility, but political outgroup sources had no effect relative to a control. This work highlights the importance of studying cognitive processes within a social context, as judgements of (mis)information change when embedded in the social world. These findings further underscore the need for multifaceted interventions that take account of the social context in which false information is processed to effectively mitigate the impact of misinformation on the public. © The Author(s) 2024.",
10.1177/17456916231185776,a network approach to investigate the dynamics of individual and collective beliefs: advances and applications of the bending model,"Changing entrenched beliefs to alter people’s behavior and increase societal welfare has been at the forefront of behavioral-science research, but with limited success. Here, we propose a new framework of characterizing beliefs as a multidimensional system of interdependent mental representations across three cognitive structures (e.g., beliefs, evidence, and perceived norms) that are dynamically influenced by complex informational landscapes: the BENDING (Beliefs, Evidence, Norms, Dynamic Information Networked Graphs) model. This account of individual and collective beliefs helps explain beliefs’ resilience to interventions and suggests that a promising avenue for increasing the effectiveness of misinformation-reduction efforts might involve graph-based representations of communities’ belief systems. This framework also opens new avenues for future research with meaningful implications for some of the most critical challenges facing modern society, from the climate crisis to pandemic preparedness. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1177/14614448211063621,protecting the community: how digital media promotes safer behavior during the covid-19 pandemic in authoritarian communities—a case study of the ultra-orthodox community in israel,"The Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in new behaviors and digital practices. This study explores how digital media has advanced safer behavior among ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults during the pandemic in authoritarian societies. We explored the level of adherence to government-issued health guidelines during the Covid-19 pandemic by conducting a public opinion survey among a representative sample of ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults (N = 500) during the second Covid-19 wave (Autumn 2020). The results show that digital media usage significantly contributes to higher levels of adherence to health guidelines. This offers new insight into the field of new media research, revealing the significant role of digital media in promoting safer behavior in times of emergency in authoritarian communities, possibly because it bypasses Internet censorship and disinformation. It also emphasizes the need for adapting risk communication to the media habits and cultural beliefs of different social groups, in turn contributing to well-being and life itself. © The Author(s) 2022.",

Specifically, we explore how such an overwhelming context is ideally suited for manipulative attempts to spread misinformation. We illustrate our account by analysing two strategies: one by which political authorities attempted to discredit scientific expertise, and one by which minority experts tried to weaken mainstream scientific expertise. In so doing, we provide a principled account of the way manipulation targeting expert voices in public discourse can affect an audience’s epistemic vigilance mechanisms, while offering insights into the role overwhelming contexts can play in bringing about these manipulative effects. © 2024 John Benjamins Publishing Company.",
10.1093/pa/gsad022,big little election lies: cynical and credulous evaluations of electoral fraud,"The ‘Big Lie’ in American politics has sparked intense concern about the erosion of public confidence in the integrity of US elections—raising questions about the legitimacy of the authorities, institutions, and principles of democratic governance. Cynicism generated from misinformation about trustworthy elections has attracted a growing body of individual-level social-psychological research in America and Europe. Another common problem found around the world, however, which has received far less attention, concerns credulous citizens who express considerable faith and confidence in flawed contests. This study theorises that at macro-level, the accuracy of any public judgments about trustworthy elections is likely to be mediated by the information environment in open and closed societies, as well as by the type of regime. To understand these issues, Part I summarises the conceptual and theoretical argument about trust and trustworthiness. Part II describes the sources of evidence. To apply the theory, data on public opinion is drawn from around 85 societies around the globe included in Waves 6 and 7 of the World Values Survey (2010–2022), with measures of electoral trust and subjective perceptions of electoral integrity among ordinary citizens. Institutional electoral performance indices are drawn from the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem 12.0). Part III analyses how far these independent estimates match public judgments of the trustworthiness of elections in each country – and how far such relationships are conditioned by the type of information society as well as by the type of regime. Part IV highlights the key findings and considers their broader implications for understanding the macro-level conditions for trust and trustworthiness. © The Author(s) 2023.

10.1371/journal.pone.0295912,navigating the uncertainty: a novel taxonomy of vaccine hesitancy in the context of covid-19,"Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant and evolving public health challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique decision context with significant uncertainty caused by the novelty of the disease being targeted, unfamiliarity with the vaccines being offered, misinformation, and strong handed government measures. In an effort to extend our understanding of vaccine hesitancy to the high uncertainty decision environment presented by COVID-19, we present a novel taxonomy of the determinants of vaccine hesitancy, based on an inductive analysis of qualitative data gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on focus group data from a purposive sample of 18 Canadians with varying sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 vaccination attitudes. An inductive thematic analysis of this data reveals eight core themes related to vaccine hesitancy: values, trust, social environment, personal anecdotes, environmental fluctuation, prior knowledge, perceived risk & systems of care. We explore these core themes as well as 25 sub-themes, contrasting them with previous models of vaccine hesitancy and suggesting potential strategies for public health professionals. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

10.3390/journalmedia4040071,information vs. presentation: three different approaches to media organizations’ science communication on instagram,"As science journalism is growing in importance and reader interest, the social media platform Instagram provides new opportunities for media organizations to distribute scientific content. The growing danger of fake news and misinformation, as well as the ongoing pandemic and trends in media consumption patterns, make it increasingly necessary for science journalists to deliver reliable content in a well-designed manner on digital platforms. This study investigates how German media companies and individual journalists inform lay audiences on new publications, findings, and developments in sciences, using the platform Instagram. A representative quantitative content analysis of Instagram posts (n = 2.605) of nine wide-ranging German accounts related to science journalism shows that the three analyzed groups (public service media outlets, private outlets, and individual journalists) pursue significantly different approaches in how they communicate scientific content on Instagram—ranging from informative to entertaining posts—varying in their text length, the complexity of the media elements used, and the tone of voice. The results shed light on a diversification of journalistic approaches to communicating scientific content on Instagram, as well as which approaches seem fruitful. Thereby, the nature of the media organization influences the complexity, design, and purpose of their science communication on Instagram. © 2023 by the authors.",
10.1007/s10212-024-00796-8,latent profiling students’ emotions towards media literacy and examining its relationship to media credibility,"Media literacy has been gaining traction as a part of higher education curricula to support learning as educational institutions are recognizing the importance of developing students’ media literacy skills. However, students’ emotional reactions towards media literacy can be vastly different and, in turn, may impact their perception of truth and credibility of mixed media messages. In this study, we explored 68 non-health professions university students’ unique emotional profiles towards media literacy. We further examined whether students with different emotional profiles would differ in their credibility ratings (truthfulness, trustworthiness, and believability) of media messages that were drawn from mainstream and fake news sources. We also investigated the relationship between emotion profiles and emotional reactions towards mainstream versus fake news messages. We employed a probabilistic, latent clustering approach, latent profiling analysis (LPA), to generate latent categories of emotion profiles. LPA revealed four distinct emotion profiles that students endorsed: (1) low emotions, (2) moderate emotions, (3) high negative emotions, and (4) high positive emotions towards learning media literacy. Additional findings revealed that students with a low emotional profile tended to rate all media messages as more truthful, trustworthy, and believable than other emotion groups. Moreover, we identified that students in the moderate emotions and high negative emotions group rated fake messages with more positive emotions. This study offers insight towards the significance of understanding how emotions towards media literacy can impact the outcomes of media perception. This is an important step that will encourage educators to develop more engaging media literacy instruction and interventions. © Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida 2024.",
10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25244,lstmcnn: a hybrid machine learning model to unmask fake news,"The widespread dissemination of false information across various online platforms has emerged as a matter of paramount concern due to the potential harm it poses to individuals, communities, and entire nations. Substantial efforts are currently underway in the research community to combat this issue. A burgeoning area of study gaining significant traction is the development of fake news identification techniques. However, this field faces formidable challenges primarily stemming from limited resources, including access to comprehensive datasets, computational resources, and evaluation tools. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring various methodologies. One promising approach involves the use of feature abstraction and vectorization techniques. In this context, we highly recommend utilizing the Python sci-kit-learn module, which offers many invaluable tools such as the Count Vectorizer and Tiff Vectorizer. These tools enable the efficient handling of text data by converting it into numerical representations, thereby facilitating subsequent analysis. Once the text data is appropriately transformed, the next crucial step involves feature selection. To achieve optimal results, researchers often employ feature selection methods based on misperception matrices. These methods allow for the exploration and selection of the most suitable features, which are essential for achieving the highest accuracy in fake news identification. © 2024 The Authors",
10.1371/journal.pone.0296444,low credibility url sharing on twitter during reporting linking rare blood clots with the oxford/astrazeneca covid-19 vaccine,"The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by an ""infodemic"" of misinformation. Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the simple approach adopted within the research to identify the most popular and influential sources of low-credibility content presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and social media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter the propagation of misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking news event.

NA,debunking news as a journalistic genre: from the inverted pyramid to a circular writing model,"This research identifies the common elements present in debunking news that define this sort of information as a new journalistic genre. For this purpose, after a standard literature review related to journalistic genres, fake news, fact-checking, and the state of journalism, a qualitative methodology consisting of a content analysis of 60 debunk news from politifact.com (the United States) and maldita.es (Spain) and interviews with editors (5) of the fact-checking platforms were carried out. Findings indicate a circular writing structure with common elements present in debunk news: A headline that points out and stresses the falsehood; a first paragraph that presents the origin of the disinformation; a body of the text that exposes the evidence found when analyzing the facts; and finally, a closing paragraph, that is the final verdict, that asserts whether the news is true or false, underlines the truth, and labels the credibility of the information. © 2024 (Paula Herrero-Diz, David Varona-Aramburu and Marta Pérez-Escolar).

10.1111/polp.12577,"to vote or not to vote? fake news, voter fraud, and support for postponing the 2020 u.s. presidential election","Prior to the 2020 election President Trump suggested the election should be postponed “until the country can make sure that only eligible American citizens can vote.” With the COVID-19 pandemic leading many states to take steps that made it easier for citizens to vote safely, the president and his allies made numerous false claims about voter fraud; others argued that voter fraud is not common and is unlikely to appreciably increase with greater reliance on mail balloting. We rely on a national Internet-based survey experiment conducted prior to the 2020 election to assess the effectiveness of both messages on citizens' support for a hypothetical proposal to postpone the presidential election. The results suggest that respondents were more likely to support postponement if they received a fake news message that fraud is common. The results also suggest that these effects are conditional; both political party and knowledge moderate the relationship. Related Articles: Aguado, N.

10.1016/j.omega.2023.102945,eriue: evidential reasoning-based influential users evaluation in social networks,"Social media users are playing an increasingly important role in disseminating information, but their ability to diffuse information may vary significantly. Therefore, evaluating the influential ability of users has become crucial to promote or curb the dissemination of specific information. Existing centrality measures have produced varying results in identifying the most influential users, but it remains a challenge to identify the most influential users in a multifaceted and consistent way in social networks, especially when only a limited number of users can be nominated. To fill this gap, this work developed an evidential reasoning-based influential users evaluation (ERIUE) model that considers multiple sources of structural information in networks. Our proposed model collates information about users’ influential ability from multiple forms of centrality measures and maps their scores to different grades in an informative belief distribution. To determine the weight of each centrality, three types of information are considered: conflict of belief distributions, similarity of probability sets, and overlap of evaluations. The information is aggregated using the recursive evidential reasoning approach based on a formulated criterion hierarchy, thereby determining the influential ability of users. The applicability of our proposed model is demonstrated by comparing it with existing measures in three real-world social networks. Our proposed model is also applicable to relevant problems beyond identifying influential users, including preventing epidemic spread, cascade failure, and misinformation dissemination in social networks. © 2023 The Author(s)",

This study experimentally examines the influence of celebrity endorsement of a conspiracy theory over social media on belief in fringe theories about chemtrails, destigmatization of conspiracy belief, and the subsequent spread of the counter-narrative on social media. The findings reveal that celebrities sharing conspiracy theories may destigmatize belief in such counter-narratives and disrupt spirals of silence that constrain the sharing of such perspectives online.

10.1007/s11229-024-04483-5,bad social norms rather than bad believers: examining the role of social norms in bad beliefs,"People with bad beliefs — roughly beliefs that conflict with those of the relevant experts and are maintained regardless of counter-evidence — are often cast as bad believers. Such beliefs are seen to be the result of, e.g., motivated or biased cognition and believers are judged to be epistemically irrational and blameworthy in holding them. Here I develop a novel framework to explain why people form bad beliefs. People with bad beliefs follow the social epistemic norms guiding how agents are supposed to form and share beliefs within their respective communities. Beliefs go bad because these norms aren’t reliably knowledge-conducive. In other words, bad beliefs aren’t due to bad believers but due bad social epistemic norms. The framework also unifies different explanations of bad beliefs, is testable and provides distinct interventions to combat such beliefs. The framework also helps to capture the complex and often contextual normative landscape surrounding bad beliefs more adequately. On this picture, it’s primarily groups that are to be blamed for bad beliefs. I also suggest that some individuals will be blameless for forming their beliefs in line with their group’s norms, whereas others won’t be. And I draw attention to the factors that influence blameworthiness-judgements in these contexts. © The Author(s) 2024.",

The particular focus is on Russian information warfare against Ukraine through local mainstream and social media. The chapter’s aim is to demonstrate the vulnerability of free press values when they are used to undermine the foundations of democracy. Local media are analyzed here as presumably describers of reality, explanators and interpreters of facts and tendencies. But at the same time, they are used by particular international political actors as an instrument of propaganda, misinformation, and disorientation of the audience by pro-Moscow narratives.

This research addresses this knowledge gap. It investigates perceptions and intentional behaviors to utilize AI dialogue systems like Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT). A survey questionnaire comprising measures from key information technology adoption models, was used to capture quantitative data from a sample of 654 respondents. A partial least squares (PLS) approach assesses the constructs' reliabilities and validities. It also identifies the relative strength and significance of the causal paths in the proposed research model. The findings from SmartPLS4 report that there are highly significant effects in this empirical investigation particularly between source trustworthiness and performance expectancy from AI chatbots, as well as between perceived interactivity and intentions to use this algorithm, among others. In conclusion, this contribution puts forward a robust information technology acceptance framework that clearly evidences the factors that entice online users to habitually engage with text-generating AI chatbot technologies. It implies that although they may be considered as useful interactive systems for content creators, there is scope to continue improving the quality of their responses (in terms of their accuracy and timeliness) to reduce misinformation, social biases, hallucinations and adversarial prompts. © 2024 The Author(s)",
10.1177/09516298231208412,law enforcement and political misinformation,"Why is criminal law enforcement increasingly punitive, despite that the situation has improved for decades? This paper investigates this question from the perspective of political misinformation. To this end, we develop a law enforcement model with political competition and examine how political parties’ campaigns affect voters’ perceptions of crime and equilibrium law enforcement policy. In a political campaign stage, we show that one political party has an incentive to overstate the severity of crime, while the other party has an incentive to correct voters’ beliefs. However, although the two parties attempt to change voters’ beliefs in opposite directions, we find that the total effect of a political campaign is more likely to drive both parties’ policies in a harsh direction. © The Author(s) 2023.",

In this research, we explore utilizing Digital Twins of Doctors (DTDs) in healthcare because using a doctor’s identity can provide benefits like enhancing the credibility of the health information delivered using computers. DTDs are computer-controlled AI-generated digital replicas of doctors that closely resemble their characteristics. However, there exist limitations, including the social implications of using a doctor’s identity, potential negative impacts on doctor–patient communication, and liability concerns. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of DTD usage in healthcare before widespread adoption, systematic research is essential. As a step towards this direction, in this qualitative research, we report findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with doctors. Our findings indicate that doctors believe DTDs offer benefits by saving doctors’ time through the efficient delivery of repetitive information and personalizing patient care. Moreover, while using a doctor’s identity can enhance credibility, it also raises concerns about using a doctor’s identity to spread potential misinformation.

People within a community are far more likely to share beliefs than people who are part of different communities. The spread of useful information across communities is impeded by echo chambers (far greater connectivity within than between communities) and filter bubbles (more influence of beliefs by connected neighbors within than between communities). We apply the tools of network analysis to organize our understanding of the spread of beliefs across modularized communities and to predict the effect of individual and group parameters on the dynamics and distribution of beliefs. In our Spread of Beliefs in Modularized Communities (SBMC) framework, a stochastic block model generates social networks with variable degrees of modularity, beliefs have different observable utilities, individuals change their beliefs on the basis of summed or average evidence (or intermediate decision rules), and parameterized stochasticity introduces randomness into decisions. SBMC simulations show surprising patterns; for example, increasing out-group connectivity does not always improve group performance, adding randomness to decisions can promote performance, and decision rules that sum rather than average evidence can improve group performance, as measured by the average utility of beliefs that the agents adopt. Overall, the results suggest that intermediate degrees of belief exploration are beneficial for the spread of useful beliefs in a community, and so parameters that pull in opposite directions on an explore–exploit continuum are usefully paired. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1007/s13280-024-01997-7,"“in the end, the story of climate change was one of hope and redemption”: chatgpt’s narrative on global warming","AI chatbots such as ChatGPT help people produce texts. According to media reporting, these texts are also used for educational purposes. Thus, AI influences people’s knowledge and perception of current issues. This paper examines the narrative of ChatGPT's stories on climate change. Our explorative analysis reveals that ChatGPT’s stories on climate change show a relatively uniform structure and similar content. Generally, the narrative is in line with scientific knowledge on climate change; the stories convey no significant misinformation. However, specific topics in current debates on global warming are conspicuously missing. According to the ChatGPT narrative, humans as a species are responsible for climate change and specific economic activities or actors associated with carbon emissions play no role. Analogously, the social structuration of vulnerability to climate impacts and issues of climate justice are hardly addressed. ChatGPT’s narrative consists of de-politicized stories that are highly optimistic about technological progress. © The Author(s) 2024.",

Exposure to misleading information after an event reduces the accuracy of witnesses’ memories. In some circumstances, warnings about misinformation can protect witnesses. As social media is a growing source of misleading information, this study examined the effect of misleading post-event information delivered via a social media-style video, as well as the utility of a minimal versus detailed warning. Participants (N = 145) watched a video showing an electrician stealing items from a client’s home. Next, they received one of three pre-warnings regarding forthcoming misleading information: a minimal warning indicating that caution should be taken, a detailed warning specifying the presence of misleading information, or no warning. Participants received the misleading information via a social media video or a standard text-based narrative. Finally, they completed a recognition test. Although delivery method did not affect errors for misleading items, detailed warnings were only effective against text-based misleading information. Participants were more confident about their correct than incorrect responses for misleading items; confidence was not affected by delivery method or warning. This experiment is the first to demonstrate people’s susceptibility to misleading post-event information delivered in a social media-style video using an eyewitness paradigm. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.1002/acp.4187,argument-based intervention as a way to reduce covid-19 unfounded beliefs and vaccination hesitancy,"The aim of the experimental study was to verify the reduction of Covid-19 unfounded beliefs through arguments in favor of vaccination. The sample includes 720 participants recruited by Qualtrics (50% women, age: M = 38.8, SD = 10.90). The participants were equally and randomly divided into three groups. The control group was given the task of reading a neutral text about Norway. The first experimental group was provided with a debunking text that corrected popular misinformation and unfounded beliefs about vaccination against polio and vaccination against Covid-19. The second experimental group read the same text as the first, with two additional paragraphs addressing the motives and errors in the thinking of unfounded belief spreaders. The results confirmed that exposing the participants to arguments for vaccination reduces the endorsement of Covid-19 unfounded beliefs and increases the willingness to be vaccinated against Covid-19 disease. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1177/17456916231190388,crowds can effectively identify misinformation at scale,"Identifying successful approaches for reducing the belief and spread of online misinformation is of great importance. Social media companies currently rely largely on professional fact-checking as their primary mechanism for identifying falsehoods. However, professional fact-checking has notable limitations regarding coverage and speed. In this article, we summarize research suggesting that the “wisdom of crowds” can be harnessed successfully to help identify misinformation at scale. Despite potential concerns about the abilities of laypeople to assess information quality, recent evidence demonstrates that aggregating judgments of groups of laypeople, or crowds, can effectively identify low-quality news sources and inaccurate news posts: Crowd ratings are strongly correlated with fact-checker ratings across a variety of studies using different designs, stimulus sets, and subject pools. We connect these experimental findings with recent attempts to deploy crowdsourced fact-checking in the field, and we close with recommendations and future directions for translating crowdsourced ratings into effective interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1111/bjso.12727,do conspiracy beliefs fuel support for reactionary social movements? effects of misbeliefs on actions to oppose lockdown and to “stop the steal”,"Pundits have speculated that the spread of conspiracies and misinformation (termed “misbeliefs”) is leading to a resurgence of right-wing, reactionary movements. However, the current empirical picture regarding the relationship between misbeliefs and collective action is mixed. We help clarify these associations by using two waves of data collected during the COVID-19 Pandemic (in Australia, N = 519, and the United States, N = 510) and democratic elections (in New Zealand N = 603, and the United States N = 609) to examine the effects of misbeliefs on support for reactionary movements (e.g., anti-lockdown protests, Study 1; anti-election protests, Study 2). Results reveal that within-person changes in misbeliefs correlate positively with support for reactionary collective action both directly (Studies 1–2) and indirectly by shaping the legitimacy of the authority (Study 1b). The relationship between misbelief and legitimacy is, however, conditioned by the stance of the authority in question: the association is positive when authorities endorse misbeliefs (Study 1a) and negative when they do not (Study 1b). Thus, the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and action hinges upon the alignment of the content of the conspiracy and the goals of the collective action. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1177/19401612241233539,"after deception: how falling for a deepfake affects the way we see, hear, and experience media","With the emergence of artificial intelligence, deepfakes have rendered it possible to manipulate anyone’s and anything’s audio-visual representation, adding fuel to the discussion about the believability of what we hear and see in the news. However, we do not know yet whether deepfakes can actually impact (1) the credibility attributed to audio-visual media in general, as well as (2) the perceived self-efficacy to discern between real and fake media. Furthermore, it remains unclear if different deepfake formats can affect citizens to differing degrees. This study employs a 3 × 2 × 2 between-within-subjects experiment (N = 951) with the between-subjects factor format (audio vs. video vs. 360°-video) and facticity (real vs. fake) and the within-subjects factor reveal (pre vs. post-reveal). We explore what happens after revealing to a sample of German participants that they have been deceived by a deepfake. Our findings show that credibility of media drops across all formats after revealing the stimulus was fake, whereas the control group is not affected. On the other hand, self-efficacy is impacted even for people who were exposed to authentic news media. This shows that deepfakes may have far-reaching societal implications that go beyond deception, whereas modality seems to matter little for such effects. © The Author(s) 2024.",
10.1007/s13369-024-08852-7,toward detecting rumor initiator in online social networks using ontology-driven model,"Online social networks (OSNs) have become breeding grounds for negative content like rumor, misinformation, disinformation, etc. A rumor is an unverified piece of information in circulation. Rumor diffusion is one of the important problems that OSNs are facing. Finding rumor initiator in an OSN is both important and challenging. Firstly, most of the solutions proposed are based on network structure while completely ignoring network semantics. Secondly, the solutions proposed are for networks that are limited in cycles, directions, and degrees. To deal with semantics and limited network structure, researchers have proposed ontological models for OSNs. However, these models are intended to solve problems like social tagging mechanism, social network access control, rumor detection, rumor modeling, etc., rather than finding rumor initiators in OSNs. In this research article, we propose an ontology-based model for OSNs that is intended to find rumor initiators in OSNs. This model comprises three layers—design-time layer, integration layer, and runtime layer. The model maps interoperable concepts of different OSNs in the upper-level ontology, which is further used to obtain vendor-specific lower-level ontology. The model is populated and queried using the property path expressions of SPARQL to find rumor initiators for two scenarios, viz. when the veracity of the rumor is known and when the veracity of the rumor is unknown. Further, the model is assessed using the OQuaRE framework for ontology quality assessment. The OQuaRE framework evaluated our proposed model for seven characteristics of ontology quality, viz. structural, functional adequacy, maintainability, reliability, operability, compatibility, and transferability. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.",
10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25889,"path analysis of perceived disease vulnerability, covid-19 fear, and lower vaccine hesitancy within the context of protection motivation theory","COVID-19 vaccinations have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing severe infections. However, vaccine hesitancy posed a major public health hurdle to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Online spread of vaccine conspiracy beliefs generated unwarranted mistrust and resistance to vaccines. While numerous studies have explored the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the interplay between perceived disease vulnerability, COVID-19 fear, and vaccine hesitancy. Protection motivation theory posits citizens will evaluate perceived threats and take actions to mitigate potential harm. With a large U.S. sample, path analysis demonstrated individuals’ perceived disease vulnerability was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Greater perceived disease vulnerability was associated with higher COVID-19 fear. Greater COVID-19 fear was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Greater vaccine conspiracy beliefs associated with higher vaccine hesitancy. However, in the presence of perceived vulnerability to disease, vaccine conspiracy beliefs associated with higher fear of COVID-19 and thereby lower vaccine hesitancy. We found under circumstances of higher perceived vulnerability to disease and fear of COVID-19, vaccine conspiratorial believers were less vaccine hesitant. We discuss how public health messaging can highlight personal risks to contracting COVID-19 to appeal to those who self-identify as disease prone, but may have reservations about vaccines because of misinformation. Successfully combating diseases entails reaching and gaining cooperation from misbelievers because misinformation is expected to continue in the digital age. By understand individual differences to vaccine hesitancy, it can help increase vaccinations and prevent severe illnesses in the post COVID-19 pandemic era. © 2024 The Authors",

In such an environment, how do you work toward evidence-based conclusions, or truth when possible? In this paper, we discuss the Auditing Standards Board (ASB)’s Audit Evidence Framework (AEF) and recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board evidence-related guidance as valuable tools to help auditors and others evaluate the information they might use to arrive at evidence-based conclusions. We encourage others to “think like an auditor” when evaluating information. Our fundamental message is that information is not automatically evidence that should be used to support conclusions. Instead, information needs to be carefully evaluated before it rises to the level of evidence to support a conclusion. © 2023, American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0299139,enhancing misinformation correction: new variants and a combination of awareness training and counter-speech to mitigate belief perseverance bias,"Belief perseverance bias refers to individuals’ tendency to persevere in biased opinions even after the misinformation that initially shaped those opinions has been retracted. This study contributes to research on reducing the negative impact of misinformation by mitigating the belief perseverance bias. The study explores the previously proposed awareness-training and counter-speech debiasing techniques, further developing them by introducing new variants and combining them. We investigate their effectiveness in mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation related to a real-life issue in an experiment involving N = 876 individuals, of whom 364 exhibit belief perseverance bias. The effectiveness of the debiasing techniques is assessed by measuring the difference between the baseline opinions before exposure to misinformation and the opinions after exposure to a debiasing technique. Our study confirmed the effectiveness of the awareness-training and counter-speech debiasing techniques in mitigating the belief perseverance bias, finding no discernible differences in the effectiveness between the previously proposed and the new variants. Moreover, we observed that the combination of awareness training and counter-speech is more effective in mitigating the belief perseverance bias than the single debiasing techniques. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102444,why do we not stand up to misinformation? factors influencing the likelihood of challenging misinformation on social media and the role of demographics,"This study investigates the barriers to challenging others who post misinformation on social media platforms. We conducted a survey amongst U.K. Facebook users (143 (57.2 %) women, 104 (41.6 %) men) to assess the extent to which the barriers to correcting others, as identified in literature across disciplines, apply to correcting misinformation on social media. We also group the barriers into factors and explore demographic differences amongst them. It has been suggested that users are generally hesitant to challenge misinformation. We found that most of our participants (58.8 %) were reluctant to challenge misinformation. We also identified moderating roles of age and gender in the likelihood of challenging misinformation. Older people were more likely to challenge misinformation compared to young adults while, men demonstrated a slightly greater likelihood to challenge compared to women. The 20 barriers influencing the decision to challenge misinformation, were then grouped into four main factors: social concerns, effort/interest considerations, prosocial intents, and content-related factors. We found that, controlling for age and gender, “social concerns” and “effort/interest considerations” have the significant impact on likelihood to challenge. Identified four factors were analysed in terms of demographic differences. Men ranked “effort/interest considerations” higher than women, while women placed higher importance on “content-related factors”. Moreover, older individuals were found to be more resilient to “social concerns”. The influence of educational background was most prominent in ranking “content-related factors”. Our findings provide important insights for the design of future interventions aimed at encouraging the challenging of misinformation on social media platforms, highlighting the need for tailored, demographically sensitive approaches. © 2023 The Authors",

Despite the importance of vaccination to mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19 infection, ensuring adequate access and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine remains a pressing concern for refugee populations. Research has suggested that community-oriented approaches and open communication with trusted individuals are essential to address this challenge. Vaccine outreach efforts were performed in Syracuse, NY, by Community Health Workers (CHWs) as trusted refugee community members. This study explored CHWs’ experiences during vaccine outreach and perceptions about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among refugees, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination. Methods: A qualitative study was performed using thematic analysis following six semi-structured interviews with CHWs. Results: Four main themes supported by 16 sub-themes were extracted. CHWs described the (1) diverse beliefs and attitudes of refugees by ethnic group, with most having low vaccine acceptance at first. (2) Barriers included contextual barriers, lack of awareness, misinformation, and withdrawal when forced from vaccine mandates. However, CHWs also identified numerous (3) facilitators to vaccination, including the internal processing and eventual vaccine acceptance, supported by external messaging by CHWs and time. Culturally sensitive intervention strategies occurred through (4) CHW team efforts and their provision of reliable information to refugee clients, with openness and over time. The team efforts of CHWs significantly contributed to refugee acceptance and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: This study revealed how the refugee population changed their belief towards the COVID-19 vaccine through trust, time, and reliable information provided by CHWs and describes culturally sensitive strategies for vaccine uptake by refugees. CHWs' reflection on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among refugees during outreach efforts is an essential perspective when implementing future public health interventions. © 2024 The Authors",

10.1038/s41598-024-56086-2,belief-consistent information is most shared despite being the least surprising,"In the classical information theoretic framework, information “value” is proportional to how novel/surprising the information is. Recent work building on such notions claimed that false news spreads faster than truth online because false news is more novel and therefore surprising. However, another determinant of surprise, semantic meaning (e.g., information’s consistency or inconsistency with prior beliefs), should also influence value and sharing. Examining sharing behavior on Twitter, we observed separate relations of novelty and belief consistency with sharing. Though surprise could not be assessed in those studies, belief consistency should relate to less surprise, suggesting the relevance of semantic meaning beyond novelty. In two controlled experiments, belief-consistent (vs. belief-inconsistent) information was shared more despite consistent information being the least surprising. Manipulated novelty did not predict sharing or surprise. Thus, classical information theoretic predictions regarding perceived value and sharing would benefit from considering semantic meaning in contexts where people hold pre-existing beliefs. © The Author(s) 2024.",

10.1007/s12144-024-05668-4,fighting fake news on social media: a comparative evaluation of digital literacy interventions,"Effective digital literacy interventions can positively influence social media users’ ability to identify fake news content. This research aimed to (a) introduce a new experiential training digital literacy intervention strategy, (b) evaluate the effect of different digital literacy interventions (i.e., priming critical thinking and an experiential training exercise) on the perceived accuracy of fake news and individuals’ subsequent online behavioral intentions, and (c) explore the underlying mechanisms that link various digital literacy interventions with the perceived accuracy of fake news and online behavioral intentions. The authors conducted a study, leveraging online experimental data from 609 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to different digital literacy interventions. Next, participants were shown a Tweeter tweet containing fake news story about the housing crisis and asked to evaluate the tweet in terms of its accuracy and self-report their intentions to engage in online activities related to it. They also reported their perceptions of skepticism and content diagnosticity. Both interventions were more effective than a control condition in improving participants’ ability to identify fake news messages. The findings suggest that the digital literacy interventions are associated with intentions to engage in online activities through a serial mediation model with three mediators, namely, skepticism, perceived accuracy and content diagnosticity. The results point to a need for broader application of experiential interventions on social media platforms to promote news consumers’ ability to identify fake news content. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
10.1111/bjso.12732,intellectual humility as a tool to combat false beliefs: an individual-based approach to belief revision,"False beliefs pose significant societal threats, including health risks, political polarization and even violence. In two studies (N = 884) we explored the efficacy of an individual-based approach to correcting false beliefs. We examined whether the character virtue of intellectual humility (IH)—an appreciation of one's intellectual boundaries—encourages revising one's false beliefs in response to counter-information. Our research produced encouraging but also mixed findings. Among participants who held false beliefs about the risks of vaccines (Study 1) and the 2020 US Election being rigged (Study 2), those with higher IH explored more information opposing these false beliefs. This exploration of opposing information, in turn, predicted updating away from these inaccurate health and political beliefs. IH did not directly predict updating away from false beliefs, however, suggesting that this effect—if it exists—may not be particularly powerful. Taken together, these results provide moderate support for IH as a character trait that can foster belief revision but, simultaneously, suggest that alternate pathways to combat false beliefs and misinformation may be preferred. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1002/acp.4154,not all bullshit pondered is tossed: reflection decreases receptivity to some types of misleading information but not others,"Across three studies (N = 659), we present evidence that engaging in explanatory reflection reduces receptivity to pseudo-profound bullshit but not scientific bullshit or fake news. Additionally, ratings for pseudo-profound and scientific bullshit attributed to authoritative sources were significantly inflated compared to bullshit from anonymous sources. These findings provide initial evidence that asking people to reflect on why they find certain statements meaningful (or not) helps reduce receptivity to some types of misinformation but not others. Moreover, the appeal of misleading claims spread by perceived experts may be largely immune to the putative benefits of interventions that rely solely on reflective thinking. Taken together, our results suggest that while encouraging the public to be more reflective can certainly be helpful as a general rule, the effectiveness of this strategy in reducing the persuasiveness of misleading or otherwise epistemically-suspect claims is limited by the type of claims being evaluated. © 2023 The Authors.

NA,long-short-term memory model for fake news detection in nigeria,"Background: The advent of technology allows information to be passed through the Internet at a breakneck speed and enables the involvement of many individuals in the use of different social media platforms. Propagation of fake news through the Internet has become rampant due to digitalisation, and the spread of fake news can cause irreparable damage to the victims. The conventional approach to fake news detection is time-consuming, hence introducing fake news detection systems. Existing fake news detection systems have yielded low accuracy and are unsuitable in Nigeria. Objective: This research aims to design and implement a framework for fake news detection using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Methodology: The dataset for the model was obtained from Nigerian dailies and Kaggle and pre-processed by removing punctuation marks and stop words, stemming, tokenisation and one hot representation. Feature extraction was done on the datasets to remove outliers. The locally acquired dataset from Nigeria was balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-which solved the problem of losing gained knowledge and information over a long period faced by RNN-was used as the detection model This model was implemented using Python 3.9. The model detected fake news by classifying real and fake news approaches. The dataset was fed into the model, and the model classified them as either fake or real news by processing the dataset through input and hidden layers of varying numbers of neurons. accuracy F1 score and detection time were used as the evaluation metrics. The results were then compared to some selected machine learning models and a hybrid of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory models (CNN-LSTM). Results: The result shows that the LSTM model on a balanced dataset performed best as the two news classes were accurately classified, giving an average detection accuracy of 92.86%, which took the model 0.42 seconds to detect whether news was real or fake. Also, 87.50% average detection accuracy was obtained from an imbalanced dataset. Compared to other machine learning models, SVM and CNN-LSTM gave 81.25% accuracy for imbalanced datasets and 82.14% and 78.57% for balanced datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The outcome of this research shows that the deep learning approach outperformed some machine learning models for fake news detection in terms of performance accuracy. Unique contribution: This work has contributed knowledge by employing an LSTM model for detecting Nigerian fake news using an indigenous dataset. Key Recommendation: Future research should increase the data size of indigenous datasets for fake news detection to achieve improved accuracy. © 2023, University of Nigeria Department of Mass Communication.

10.3758/s13421-024-01520-z,how do forewarnings and post-warnings affect misinformation reliance? the impact of warnings on the continued influence effect and belief regression,"People often continue to rely on certain information in their reasoning, even if this information has been retracted; this is called the continued influence effect (CIE) of misinformation. One technique for reducing this effect involves explicitly warning people that there is a possibility that they might have been misled. The present study aimed to investigate these warnings’ effectiveness, depending on when they were given (either before or after misinformation). In two experiments (N = 337), we found that while a forewarning did reduce reliance on misinformation, retrospectively warned participants (when the warning was placed either between the misinformation and the retraction or just before testing) relied on the misinformation to a similar degree as unwarned participants. However, the protective effect of the forewarning was not durable, as shown by the fact that reliance on the misinformation increased for over 7 days following the first testing, despite continued memory of the retraction. © 2024, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1080/20445911.2024.2314975,false information is harder to debunk after gist repetitions than verbatim repetitions,"Research has shown that repeating a claim increases belief in it and makes it more difficult to correct. This is referred to as the illusory truth effect. Previous studies have mostly examined the illusory truth effect in a verbatim paradigm, that is, when information is repeated word-for-word. In the present study, we looked at the difference between repeating a claim word-for-word and repeating only its gist, and how both these contexts can mitigate belief in false information that is refuted or not. Results show that gist and verbatim repetitions both lead to high, and relatively equal, levels of belief when they are not disconfirmed, and that a subsequent correction is more effective in lowering belief levels after verbatim than after gist repetition. This provides evidence that the way in which information is repeated has a differential impact on our ability to debias it. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0296151,exploring factors influencing user perspective of chatgpt as a technology that assists in healthcare decision making: a cross sectional survey study,"As ChatGPT emerges as a potential ally in healthcare decision-making, it is imperative to investigate how users leverage and perceive it. The repurposing of technology is innovative but brings risks, especially since AI's effectiveness depends on the data it's fed. In healthcare, ChatGPT might provide sound advice based on current medical knowledge, which could turn into misinformation if its data sources later include erroneous information. Our study assesses user perceptions of ChatGPT, particularly of those who used ChatGPT for healthcare-related queries. By examining factors such as competence, reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, and persuasiveness of ChatGPT, the research aimed to understand how users rely on ChatGPT for health-related decisionmaking. A web-based survey was distributed to U.S. adults using ChatGPT at least once a month. Bayesian Linear Regression was used to understand how much ChatGPT aids in informed decision-making. This analysis was conducted on subsets of respondents, both those who used ChatGPT for healthcare decisions and those who did not. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis, with thematic coding to extract public opinions on urban environmental policies. Six hundred and seven individuals responded to the survey. Respondents were distributed across 306 US cities of which 20 participants were from rural cities. Of all the respondents, 44 used ChatGPT for healthrelated queries and decision-making. In the healthcare context, the most effective model highlights 'Competent + Trustworthy + ChatGPT for healthcare queries', underscoring the critical importance of perceived competence and trustworthiness specifically in the realm of healthcare applications of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the non-healthcare context reveals a broader spectrum of influential factors in its best model, which includes 'Trustworthy + Secure + Benefits outweigh risks + Satisfaction + Willing to take decisions + Intent to use + Persuasive'. In conclusion our study findings suggest a clear demarcation in user expectations and requirements from AI systems based on the context of their use. We advocate for a balanced approach where technological advancement and user readiness are harmonized.  © 2024 Choudhury et al.

Importantly, these positive effects are not systematically attenuated by partisan motivated reasoning, highlighting a striking difference from Western contexts. We also find that the presence of a correction matters more relative to how sophisticated this correction is: substantiating a correction with a source only improves its effect in a minority of cases; besides, when social corrections are effective, citing a source does not drastically improve the size of their effect. These results have implications for both users and platforms and speak to countering misinformation in developing countries that rely on private messaging apps. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25933,deepfake detection using deep feature stacking and meta-learning,"Deepfake is a type of face manipulation technique using deep learning that allows for the replacement of faces in videos in a very realistic way. While this technology has many practical uses, if used maliciously, it can have a significant number of bad impacts on society, such as spreading fake news or cyberbullying. Therefore, the ability to detect deepfake has become a pressing need. This paper aims to address the problem of deepfake detection by identifying deepfake forgeries in video sequences. In this paper, a solution to the said problem is presented, which at first uses a stacking based ensemble approach, where features obtained from two popular deep learning models, namely Xception and EfficientNet-B7, are combined. Then by selecting a near-optimal subset of features using a ranking based approach, the final classification is performed to classify real and fake videos using a meta-learner, called multi-layer perceptron. In our experimentation, we have achieved an accuracy of 96.33% on Celeb-DF (V2) dataset and 98.00% on the FaceForensics++ dataset using the meta-learning model both of which are higher than the individual base models. Various types of experiments have been conducted to validate the robustness of the current method. © 2024 The Author(s)",
10.1007/s11158-024-09661-3,publicity’s misinformation problem,"This paper argues that everyday practices crucial for ensuring politically engaged citizens such as sharing news articles or deliberating about potential laws can also be responsible for undermining the state’s efforts to publicize the law. Theorists view publicity—a requirement that laws should be public and accessible—as having crucial normative and practical importance in liberal democracy and, more broadly, in ensuring the rule of law. Due to egalitarian concerns, laws are often long, complex, and specific to ensure that street-level bureaucrats exercise low levels of discretion in applying the law. This—what I deem the institutional publicity problem—means that the law is so inaccessible that busy, everyday citizens must turn to third-party sources to understand policymaking. These intermediaries often make mistakes promulgating the law. Misinformation is hard to counteract, and pre-existing beliefs affect information acceptance. This all represents a behavioral publicity problem: morally and legally permissible actions can complicate and undermine reasonable efforts of citizens to learn about the law. I argue that the state is caught between a rock and a hard place. While there are benefits to having the state fight against misinformation, it also raises serious concerns about democratic engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.",
NA,an experimental test of misconception corrections across health domains,"The endorsement of misconceptions is prevalent in a variety of domains, including several health domains (e.g., vaccinations, mental health), and may lead to harmful consequences. This study examined the effects of myth debunking posters formatted to co-activate misconceptions and factual information across several health domains versus only presenting factual evidence to dispel these misconceptions. Accuracy of knowledge about the health domains was tested in two ways: immediately after participants viewed the posters or after a 30-minute delay. Using an experimental design, 218 participants completed one of six conditions: (a) myths and facts-immediate, (b) facts only-immediate, (c) control-immediate, (d) myths and facts-delay, (e) facts only-delay, and (f) control-delay. Knowledge was more accurate for participants in the experimental conditions than participants in the control conditions. These data suggest that the format used to correct misinformation may be less important than the act of refuting. © NAJP.",
10.1080/08850607.2023.2228489,reflexive control as a risk factor for using osint: insights from the russia–ukraine conflict,"Special governmental services, security services of leading companies, and private researchers rely on open-source intelligence (OSINT). With the development of the Internet and social networks, open-data intelligence is increasingly turning from a subtle art into a “mechanical” process—the more data, the better. OSINT professionals’ competence enables verification of information and minimizes the chances of deception unless the intention of the investigation and the data’s locale are previously known to their adversary. In this very case, the hunter can get into a trap dexterously rigged by an adversary. This article discusses the risks of disinformation through open sources in the context of the Soviet concept of “reflexive control”; that is, imposing unfavorable decisions on the enemy through the introduction of incorrect premises, exemplified by the experience of the Russian–Ukrainian conflict since 2014. The article evaluates the influence exerted on the governmental and military decisions by disinformation through open sources, examining several reported cases. Systematization of data on previous attempts at reflexive control, such as Russian information operations, can increase the accuracy of assessing the depth of an enemies’ reflexion, which helps to reveal their operational plans and predict further actions because disinformation often precedes other forms of aggression. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study aims to better understand how fact-checks relate to various outcomes relevant to audiences’ resilience to false information. We randomly exposed 752 Dutch participants to fact-checks of a disputed health-related claim vs. no fact-check. The fact-checks either followed a classic format which repeated the false claim or followed a truth sandwich format wrapping the false claim in accurate information. While the truth sandwich was not effective in correcting false beliefs, it had indirect benefits. First, those who saw a truth sandwich perceived the intentions of fact-checkers more positively thinking that their intention was to inform rather than to manipulate or spread lies. Second, those who saw a truth sandwich showed the least resistance to reading subsequent fact-checks. For journalism practice this implies that different fact-check formats can be strategically employed to achieve desired outcomes. A more classic fact-check format might be preferable if the primary aim is to correct false beliefs, while the truth sandwich may be employed to reach more indirect and long-term aims like rebuilding confidence in fact-checkers or stimulating future verification behaviors. © 2024 The Author(s).

10.1002/acp.4184,susceptibility to cancer misinformation: predictors of false belief and false memory formation,"Previous research has shown that people sometimes come to believe in misinformation presented in the form of fake news, and even form false memories for the fabricated events described. This study aimed to investigate the effects of analytical reasoning, attitudes to complementary and alternative medicine, bullshit receptivity, and previous experience with cancer on the formation of false memory and false belief for cancer related misinformation. Participants (N = 466) were exposed to four fake news stories and four true news stories relating to cancer treatment and services. Male gender, low analytical reasoning, receptivity to bullshit, and endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine were all significant predictors of belief in cancer misinformation, while participants with poor analytical reasoning or higher receptivity to bullshit reported more false memories for fake news stories. These results indicate that reflexive, intuitive thinking styles contribute to susceptibility to cancer misinformation, suggesting a potential target for public health interventions. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1080/10106049.2024.2311211,an urban-rural fringe extraction method based on combined urban-rural fringe index (cufi),"In this article, a multi-source data-based method for urban-rural fringe extraction is proposed to solve the problem of insufficiently accurate division of urban-rural fringe, which can conveniently and accurately realise the extraction of the area of urban-rural fringe. The method uses multi-source data such as night light remote sensing images, POI data and high-resolution remote sensing images. We constructed the Combined Urban-Rural Fringe Index (CUFI) model based on the characteristics of NDVI and NTL, POI kernel density value points that change from the city centre to the surrounding area. The calculation of CUFI involves three aspects. The initial step involves processing data, which includes reducing noise in nighttime light images and removing inaccurate information from POI data. The subsequent step involves calculating combined features of NTL and POI kernel density, which includes analyzing the kernel density of POI data, standardizing the results of POI kernel density and nighttime light data, computing NTL & POI indexes using the equal weight combined feature calculation method and reclassifying NTL & POI indexes.The third part involves rejecting misinformation using NDVI. This includes calculating the NDVI index using high-resolution satellite data, rejecting bare land information in the NDVI index using nighttime light data, and reclassifying the processed results. The reclassified results are then multiplied with the reclassification results of the NTL&POI index to obtain the CUFI calculation results. In order to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the method, Tangshan City, Hebei Province was selected as the experimental area, and the method was used to compare and analyse the accuracy with the traditional urban built-up area boundary extraction method. The results show that compared with the traditional method, the extraction accuracy of the CUFI method is higher, reaching 89.51%, which is able to effectively identify urban villages and lakes in the urban area, as well as improving the resolution of extracting Urban-Rural Fringe using NTL& POI methods, and also the urban-rural fringe which has weak night light and fewer POI points, but actually has urban-rural duality attributes Extraction. © 2024 The Author(s).

10.3758/s13421-023-01468-6,the impact of implicit narrator reliability on production of information,"Previous research established that readers acquire accurate and inaccurate information from fiction. The current study explored factors that might moderate these effects. Participants read fictional stories that each contained three assertions. The first two assertions in each story were either correct information or implausible misinformation, allowing a manipulation of the (implicit) credibility of the narrator. The last assertion in each story was the critical one, and was correct information, implausible misinformation, or plausible misinformation. After reading, participants answered general knowledge questions that were related to the critical assertions they encountered during reading. Encountering misinformation led to lower accuracy than being presented with correct information, and being presented with plausible misinformation led to higher production of that misinformation. The narrator credibility manipulation interacted with the type of critical assertion: When the critical assertion was presented accurately in a story, credible narrators presenting true critical assertions led to greater accuracy on the general knowledge test than when noncredible narrators presented this same information. These findings are discussed with respect to theories of validation during language comprehension. © The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2023.",
10.1186/s41155-024-00288-0,naive skepticism scale: development and validation tests applied to the chilean population,"Background: Skepticism has traditionally been associated with critical thinking. However, philosophy has proposed a particular type of skepticism, termed naive skepticism, which may increase susceptibility to misinformation, especially when contrasting information from official sources. While some scales propose to measure skepticism, they are scarce and only measure specific topics; thus, new instruments are needed to assess this construct. Objective: This study aimed to develop a scale to measure naive skepticism in the adult population. Method: The study involved 446 individuals from the adult population. Subjects were randomly selected for either the pilot study (phase 2; n = 126) or the validity-testing study (phase 3; n = 320). Parallel analyses and exploratory structural equation modelling were conducted to assess the internal structure of the test. Scale reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients Finally, a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess invariance, and a Set- Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling was applied to estimate evidence of validity based on associations with other variables. Results: The naive skepticism scale provided adequate levels of reliability (ω > 0.8), evidence of validity based on the internal structure of the test (CFI = 0.966; TLI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.079), gender invariance, and a moderate inverse effect on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: The newly developed naive skepticism scale showed acceptable psychometric properties in an adult population, thus enabling the assessment of naive skepticism in similar demographics. This paper discusses the implications for the theoretical construct and possible limitations of the scale. © The Author(s) 2024.",
10.1038/s41598-023-47939-3,understanding belief in political statements using a model-driven experimental approach: a registered report,"Abstract: Misinformation harms society by affecting citizens' beliefs and behaviour. Recent research has shown that partisanship and cognitive reflection (i.e. engaging in analytical thinking) play key roles in the acceptance of misinformation. However, the relative importance of these factors remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this registered study, we tested four hypotheses on the relationship between each factor and the belief in statements made by Argentine politicians. Participants (N = 1353) classified fact-checked political statements as true or false, completed a cognitive reflection test, and reported their voting preferences. Using Signal Detection Theory and Bayesian modeling, we found a reliable positive association between political concordance and overall belief in a statement (median = 0.663, CI95 = [0.640, 0.685]), a reliable positive association between cognitive reflection and scepticism (median = 0.039, CI95 = [0.006, 0.072]), a positive but unreliable association between cognitive reflection and truth discernment (median = 0.016, CI95 = [− 0.015, 0.046]) and a negative but unreliable association between cognitive reflection and partisan bias (median = − 0.016, CI95 = [− 0.037, 0.006]). Our results highlight the need to further investigate the relationship between cognitive reflection and partisanship in different contexts and formats.

10.1017/XPS.2022.33,the big lie: expressive responding and misperceptions in the united states,"Misinformation about events surrounding the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic pose an existential threat to American democracy and public health. Public opinion surveys reveal that high percentages of Republicans indicate that they endorse some aspects of mistaken beliefs surrounding election fraud in the 2020 election. Still, understanding how to measure the endorsement of misperceptions is critical for understanding the threat at hand. Are high levels of mistaken beliefs genuinely held, or are they partially a function of expressive responding? I address this question through a set of survey experiments encouraging accuracy-oriented processing among the general public. Using well-powered surveys of Republicans and Independents, I find that treatments designed to encourage more accurate responses are ineffective in reducing the endorsement of partisan electoral and public health misperceptions and can in some cases even backfire. These findings suggest that support for these misperceptions is genuinely held.  © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of American Political Science Association.",

10.1177/23996544241229553,"a polluting war: risk, experts, and the politics of monitoring wartime environmental harm in eastern ukraine","War always harms the environment. As the fog of war produces unreliable data, it also obstructs our capacity to monitor those harms. While some call for more data collection to advance a clear narrative of the origins of environmental harm, sociologists of risk and professional risk assessors find that the urgency of environmental hazards depends not on data alone but on who has the authority to define those risks. Without a clear understanding of how environmental experts engage in the socio-political struggles over the interpretations of risk during armed conflict, we may undervalue, first, how assessments and adequate action remain practically and politically difficult, and second, how data may be misused. Drawing on interviews with environmental experts and reports, I examine the politics of environmental expert knowledge on conflict pollution in the war in Donbas (2014–2022), a region hosting over 4500 hazardous industrial enterprises. By going beyond technological evidence collection, the article broadens our understanding of the obstacles of knowledge production and the attribution of environmental harm in highly politicized and violent contexts. Based on insights from environmental politics, the article finds that experts manage three issues undermining the reliability of environmental risks in an active warzone: pre-existing industrial pollution, environmental damage spread across government and non-government-controlled territories, and disinformation. © The Author(s) 2024.",

Governmental plans to improve this situation by addressing sexual diversity in German schools have been accompanied by public resistance and misinformation, e.g., that they aim to sexualize children. The present study assessed how widespread negative attitudes toward such plans really are and how they can be explained. A random sample of 2,013 German residents was surveyed by phone. Only 10% opposed promoting acceptance of LGB in school. Approval of such plans was predominantly predicted by respondents’ beliefs about sexual orientation and the plans’ aim, and only marginally by societal values. Respondents who knew that the plans’ aim was to promote acceptance of LGB and not to sexualize children and that children with same-sex parents are just as well off as those with heterosexual parents showed higher approval, whereas respondents who believed that homosexuality is affected by socialization showed higher opposition. © 2022 The Author(s).

It involves many steps from one culture to the other. Many scholars have documented the role of social media tools in bereavement processes. In this study, I look at the challenges and opportunities offered by Facebook during bereavement, especially in a community that is still traditional and has yet to fully comprehend the importance of social media, particularly in matters considered sacred. The study used interviews with residents from Taung to collect data. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the collected data from the interviews. The study findings indicate some challenges associated with bereavement on Facebook: emotional shock, lack of sensitivity, misinformation, and cultural dilution. There are also opportunities: fast news sharing, ongoing emotional support, and sharing of memories. The study argues that the findings should expand our understanding and knowledge of bereavement in some African cultures and use social media tools to complement and not destroy African beliefs and practices.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates many of these disparities, and specific vulnerabilities faced by the CLI population. This study investigated the prevalence of COVID-19-related misinformation, as well as its relationship with COVID-19 information sources used among Americans experiencing CLI. A nationally representative sample of American adults aged 18+ (N = 1,161), including a subsample of CLI individuals (n = 168), were surveyed in February-March 2021. On a 10-item test, CLI participants endorsed a greater number of misinformation statements (M = 1.88 vs. 1.27) than non-CLI participants, p .001. CLI participants reported less use of government and scientific sources (p = .017) and less use of personal sources (p = .003) for COVID-19 information than non-CLI participants. Poisson models showed that use of government and scientific sources was negatively associated with misinformation endorsement for non-CLI participants (IRR = .841, p .001), but not for CLI participants (IRR = .957, p = .619). These findings suggest that building and leveraging trust in important information sources are critical to the containment and mitigation of COVID-19-related misinformation in the CLI population. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

Using a preregistered quota-based online experiment in Germany (N = 1401), we tested how the effectiveness of disinformation correction in reducing climate misperceptions was influenced by correction placement (prebunking or debunking) and correction type (focused on facts, logic, or the combination of both). We investigated how populist radical-right (PRR) attitudes moderate the effect of disinformation correction and whether correction alleviates the negative effects of disinformation on efficacy beliefs to mitigate climate change (EBMCC) through reduced misperceptions. All debunking conditions and the logic-focused prebunking condition significantly reduced climate misperceptions. Prebunking was only effective under the logic-focused correction condition. We found no moderating effect of PRR attitudes on climate misperceptions, suggesting that corrections similarly benefitted all participants. In addition, a significant indirect effect of corrections was observed on EBMCC via climate misperceptions. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

10.1111/teth.12654,why we need to complicate things: the teaching and learning of religion beyond simplification,"Much knowledge production, both academic and non-academic, is driven by a need to simplify the world in order to enable people to navigate the complexities of everyday life. Such simplifications not only risk offering less reliable representations of the world, they can also turn into disruptive and harmful images of the world. In this article, students and teachers in the field of religion and theology are encouraged to value scientific research as a form of knowledge production that complicates things. In an age in which scientific knowledge is constantly contested and in which it competes with other forms of knowledge production (including problematic ones such as fake news, conspiracy theories, stereotyped representations of religion and religious others, and poorly executed journalism), it is important for students to understand that complicating things is a key step in developing reliable knowledge on religion and the (ir)religious other. This article, written for students starting out in the field of theology and religion and for those who teach them, explains how complicating things takes shape in scientific research by discussing three basic elements: (1) not taking things at face value, (2) understanding science as knowledge production and reflecting on science as production, (3) and realizing that there is no absolute certainty. © 2023 The Author.

This chapter examines three enduring challenges that affect the achievement of this goal. First, there is a perennial tension between the desire for greater coordination and oversight on the one hand and flexibility, agility, and responsiveness on the other. Moving quickly in cyberspace, often seen as an operational necessity, can make it harder for relevant entities to coordinate and oversee those same operations. Second, the fact that the United States’ chief rivals are autocracies, each of which tightly controls the Internet, introduces complications when it comes to devising appropriate responses to cyber-enabled disinformation and election meddling. Third and finally, there is the continued problem of credibility in cyberspace. The secrecy surrounding most cyber operations and the difficulty of imposing painful enough costs that would change an adversary’s decision calculus, among several other issues, imposes constraints on its utility for things like coercion. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, David V.

The study found that repeated exposure of myths within corrective information increased the perceived familiarity about the misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. This effect, which ultimately increased misinformation credibility, was pronounced even among individuals with low and moderate levels of prior beliefs in the misinformation. Our findings suggest practical implications for minimizing the unexpected backfire effect of corrections against vaccine misinformation on social media.

10.1038/s41598-024-51181-w,intensionality is more cognitively demanding than false belief in adults: evidence from a non-inferential sentence-reading task,"Children are said to understand false belief if they can appreciate an agent’s wrong description of an object as a result of misinformation, and intensionality if they can appreciate and switch between alternative descriptions from different epistemic viewpoints. Most previous studies have investigated the developmental trajectories of these capacities in the age range from 3 to 10 years aiming to discern their conceptual nature. The present research examines whether intensionality incurs lower performance accuracies and longer response times than false belief in adults, using a task in which participants read sentences that explicitly state an agent’s beliefs. Experiment 1 showed that participants were less accurate in rejecting verbal probes that contradicted an agent’s alternative than false thoughts about objects. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this finding using thoughts about object identities but not properties. These results suggest that compared to false belief, intensionality is cognitively demanding for adults to process because of the availability of more than one identity candidate under the agent’s perspective. © 2024, The Author(s).",
10.1002/berj.3909,"many truths, many knowledges, many forms of reason: understanding middle-school student approaches to sources of information on the internet","Sourcing information related to socio-scientific issues requires sophisticated literacies to read and evaluate conflicting accounts often signified by disagreement among experts, multiple solutions or misinformation. Much of the previous work exploring how young people approach conflicting information has tended to focus on students in the secondary and tertiary years, often taking an epistemic approach to analysis, rather than a literacies lens. At the heart of such endeavours, however, is the need for sophisticated reading skills accelerated by shifts to digital platforms to source information. Given the limited empirical studies in the field of literacy that articulate how middle school students approach sources of information, this study investigates 45 middle school students’ (13–14 years of age) self-reported strategies for investigating health risks associated with mobile phone use. We asked the students to imagine that a close friend was worried about the health risks of using their mobile phone and had asked them for advice. Students were then prompted to describe how they would search for information about the issue and how they would know if the information was reliable. Our analysis identified three dominant themes in the interview data, namely: (i) mistrust of the internet—people can be reliable sources; (ii) reliable sourcing requires consensus across sources; and (iii) criteria help to determine a reliable source. An interesting finding was the level of scepticism of the internet expressed by students. We draw on examples from the students’ interview dialogue to illustrate the themes and engage in discourse related to their approaches including implications for teaching in English classrooms. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1017/rep.2023.44,"context, contact, and misinformation about socially marginalized groups in the united states","How does context influence individuals' misinformation about socially marginalized groups? Scholarship has long found that one's geographical and social environment are important determinants for one's political attitudes. But how these contexts shape individuals' levels of misinformation about stigmatized groups remains an open and pressing question, especially given the swift rise of misinformation in recent years. Using three original surveys, we find that individuals who report more contact with a diverse group of individuals were significantly less likely to be misinformed. These findings are particularly pronounced among white Americans. Moreover, contrary to the popular belief that where one lives is a strong determinant of racial attitudes, we also find that partisan and racial context did not meaningfully shape misinformation. These findings shed light on the factors that helps us to understand the misinformation that exists about this sizable share of U.S. society.  © The Author(s), 2024.

10.1002/sce.21855,students' credibility criteria for evaluating scientific information: the case of climate change on social media,"The rise of social media platforms and the subsequent lack of traditional gatekeeping mechanisms contribute to the multiplied spread of scientific misinformation. Particularly in these new media spaces, there is a rising need for science education in fostering a science media literacy that enables students to evaluate the credibility of scientific information. A key determinant of a successful credibility evaluation is the effectiveness of the criteria students apply in this process. However, research suggests that existing credibility criteria are often not integrated into students' actual social media evaluation behavior. This hints to a lack of transferability of the existing criteria. As a consequence, knowledge about how learners evaluate credibility in social media is a first step in closing this gap. In the present study, we report results from six focus groups with 21 10th-grade students (M = 15 years, 57% female, 38% male, 5% nonbinary) about their usage of different credibility criteria in the case of social media posts about climate change. The data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis and as a first step assigned to established credibility dimensions of content (what?) and source-related criteria (who?). Additionally, given the complexity of social media, we also added a composition-based category (how?). In a second analysis step, we adapted our subcategories to the recently proposed credibility heuristic by Osborne and Pimentel. The findings suggest that students generally take criteria from all three heuristic credibility dimensions into account and combine different criteria when evaluating the credibility of scientific information in social media. Based on the application of the credibility criteria to the heuristic, implications for the development of teaching materials for fostering science media literacy are discussed. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1515/lass-2023-0040,semiotics and political discourse in the post-truth era,"The concept of post-truth has been on the world’s agenda since 2016. Perhaps this concept, which is frequently encountered in political life, provides the speaker with a freer speaking platform. Politicians, instead of presenting the reality to their constituents as it is, want to reshape this reality according to their own ideology and present it to the recipient. Politicians have certain objectives in creating such a virtual reality. These aims can be listed as keeping the voters, increasing the voting potential, and attracting undecided voters to their favor. The common result of all these aims is to gain political power or to remain in the existing power. Post-truth reality is constructed relatively more easily in social media environments. The construction of reality can be through beliefs or emotions. In such ways, the recipient is tried to be persuaded, and thus behavioral change is achieved. One of the most necessary subjects for this artificial reality atmosphere is the anti-subject. The idea that the anti-subject does not know the truth that we (you and I) know and believe and is trying to destroy it is the main theme of post-truth discourse. Politicians try to persuade the voters to believe in their own truth by expressing this idea to them. There are many examples of this around the world. In this study, firstly, the concept of post-truth is examined and its various definitions are discussed. The distinctions between the concepts of real and truth are analyzed and then it is explained how and for what purposes the concept of post-truth is used in politics. Following the comparison of post-truth and fake news, the concept is discussed within the framework of sender-receiver interaction in terms of communication. The concept is tried to be elucidated with the modalities such as /convincing/, /believing/, /being/, /appearing/. Besides, using the semiotic square, the study also tries to reveal the different purposes and forms of use of the concept of post-truth. As a result, it has been observed that the concept of post-truth is effective in many areas of contemporary societies, and rather than real information, expected and desired information has become more important. © 2023 the author(s)",
10.1007/978-3-031-54144-5_148,reframing and broadening adversarial stylometry for academic integrity,"Adversarial stylometry can be a form of academic fraud that involves the deceptive manipulation of text through manual, hybrid, or automatic techniques to obfuscate or impersonate with the intent to circumvent plagiarism detection; exploit or mask personal identifiers (including demographic, personality, and behavior), alter time series linguistic features, either for gain or to avoid undue discrimination. This term was reframed for academic integrity in this chapter to understand this vulnerability fully. A threat model was created that identified 29 threats classified as high, moderate, and low. Text-matching software is starting to integrate stylometry to capture one’s stylistic writing voice, particularly given the problem of contract cheating. New ways to circumvent progress come with any technical advancement, and an adversarial response is often generated. Higher education needs to be aware given its text-matching software usage. This chapter builds on the early work by Brennan, Afroz, & Greenstead (ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, 15(3), 1–22, 2011), and reviewed the literature on adversarial stylometry, emphasizing the intersection with plagiarism and contract cheating. Research examines academic integrity through the lens of forensic linguistics and looks to the field of fake news to provide new insights. This work is relevant for scholars and practitioners interested in academic integrity, text- matching software, and security. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",
10.3390/rel15010028,from religious bubble to interreligious dialogue: a personal story of transformation,"This paper argues that interreligious dialogue through study and friendships across the religious divide makes participants less susceptible to religious and cultural misinformation that is often used to maintain social bubbles, in which members draw clear boundaries between “us” and “them”. Differences between social groups can culminate in a struggle between “good” and “evil” that can escalate into tension and violence. Preventing tensions and conflicts requires respect for differences, willingness to engage in dialogue, and a sound understanding of what religion is and the historical processes that have determined its development, distinguishing between empirical facts and images to which believers adhere. Because the author is a Dutch sociologist turned journalist from a conservative Christian family involved in interreligious dialogue in the Netherlands, Israel, and Egypt, the literature review presents contemporary religious developments in all three countries. The literature review is flanked by the author’s personal narrative on the events that changed his views on truth and spirituality, making him more aware of the commonalities between peoples of different beliefs and leading him to a lifelong commitment to interreligious and intercultural dialogue. © 2023 by the author.",

Yet, it is unclear how to encourage users to make accurate evaluations. Our study shows that presenting the performance of previous participants increases discernment of science-related news. Making participants aware that their evaluations would be used by future participants had no effect on accuracy. Lastly, monetary rewards have the largest effect on accuracy. Our study provides support for the idea that a person’s motivation is an essential component of their propensity to be vigilant online and that it is possible to devise strategies to strengthen this motivation. © 2024, Harvard Kennedy School.

I present the results of four surveys in Russia, in which more than 60,000 participants evaluated 74 true and false news headlines. I find that Russians’ capacity to discern falsehoods is comparable to discernment found in other political contexts, and they could often detect false news stories. However, consumers of state media gave less accurate evaluations than consumers of independent media, and government supporters were substantially more susceptible to pro-regime misinformation than opposition-minded citizens. Supporters also strongly rejected true messages inconsistent with their political dispositions. These results help understand why in environments dominated by propaganda individuals can be quite vulnerable to information manipulation. At the same time, regime critics in my study often fell for propaganda-inconsistent falsehoods. These results highlight the broader challenge of fighting misinformation and propaganda in a situation when many citizens exhibit political biases. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1073/pnas.2315195121,the distorting effects of producer strategies: why engagement does not reveal consumer preferences for misinformation,"A great deal of empirical research has examined who falls for misinformation and why. Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true ones-even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information. We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they perceive as more accurate-both in a general population sample, and in a sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news-and consistent with the predictions of our model-we find markedly different engagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news sites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news sites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings collected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively correlated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be straightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement.",

Despite an escalating crisis, the combination of factors that dictate belief in fake news remains unclear. To this purpose, we evaluate the expanding corpus of fake news articles that discuss the impact on brands and deliver crucial insights through a first-of-its-kind methodological fusion of meta-synthesis and qualitative comparative analysis. Preliminary analysis reveals a set of four themes that induce belief in fake news. The envisaged plan for qualitative comparative analysis seeks to unpack the combinatorial effect of factors driving belief in brand-related fake news.

10.1016/j.jretconser.2023.103545,assessment of bidirectional transformer encoder model and attention based bidirectional lstm language models for fake news detection,"Fake news arouses to be untrue with the point of deceiving it openly which is now viewed as the greatest threat to society by cultivating the political division and doubts in government. Since this kind of news is disseminated in sheer volume through social media, driving the improvement of strategies for the recognizable proof of false news is necessary. Therefore, this study focuses on text analytics to derive the hidden properties of stylistic content to detect fake and real news. An erudite literature study of fake news detection diverted towards issues such as attention, context, and parallelization. In this same direction, the assessment evaluates the sequential memory-based deep learning model in comparison to the parallel memory-based deep learning model. For sequential, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-Directional LSTM, and Attention-based Bi-directional LSTM are taken into consideration. Besides, for parallel, the transformer-based BERT model is examined. To identify the efficacy of applied approaches, four datasets are taken from diverse domains such as political news, entertainment news, satire news, conspiracy news, and global pandemic news. The experimental analysis of real-world information demonstrates that the pre-trained transformer encoder-based BERT model outperforms with a quite significant margin of improvement. Also, as inspected Attention-based Bi-directional approach provides state-of-the-art results with good training accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1002/tea.21934,it's not just a science thing: educating future stem professionals through mis/disinformation responsive instruction,"Informed scientific thinking is a vital component of engaging all socioscientific issues (SSI) such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, socioscientific engagement may be influenced by sociocultural factors and mis/disinformation efforts to the widespread detriment of human and environmental well-being. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to determine how 506 post-secondary life science majors' COVID-19 related nature science (NOS) views and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance changed through pandemic responsive instruction on COVID-19 science, viral biology, and vaccines with integrated focus on NOS and mis/disinformation. This investigation also sought to reveal factors (e.g., sociocultural group membership, NOS views) that associated with changes in those students' COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance. After experiencing the pandemic responsive instruction, the students' COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance and trust in COVID-19 science and cognizance of its reliable and revisionary character (i.e., NOS) significantly improved from a small to large extent. Through the pandemic responsive instruction, the students' development of NOS views significantly associated with their development of higher levels of vaccine acceptance and conspiracy resistance and increases in students' vaccine conspiracy resistance significantly associated with increases in vaccine acceptance. Changes in students' vaccine acceptance and conspiracy resistance from before to after the pandemic responsive instruction also varied significantly based on sociocultural grouping (e.g., race/ethnicity and political orientation). Despite the promising impact demonstrated by the pandemic responsive instruction, vaccine conspiracy views and resistance appeared to linger among the students who notably were entering fields that deal with viruses, vaccines, and public health. Implications discussed include the importance for helping students to understand NOS relevant to SSI and analyze how sociocultural membership, motivated and identity protective reasoning processes, mis/disinformation, and trust in science influence socioscientific decision-making. © 2024 The Authors.

10.1002/acp.4146,others (dis-)endorse this so it must (not) be true: high relative endorsement increases perceived misinformation veracity but not correction effectiveness,"People increasingly rely on social-media platforms to access information; thus, understanding how platform characteristics influence belief in misinformation is important. Recent findings indicate perceived social endorsement of information (e.g., number of likes) can influence misinformation belief and correction acceptance. However, how the influence of endorsement may be modulated by concurrent disendorsement information (e.g., dislikes) is unclear. Across two experiments, we assessed the influence of relative endorsement on misinformation belief and correction acceptance. Experiment 1 exposed participants to claims and fact-checks with a high or low likes-to-dislikes ratio. Experiment 2 simplified the relative-endorsement information into a single value (i.e., a percentage). Results suggest high relative social endorsement of misinformation significantly increases misinformation belief, particularly when the endorsement information is presented as a single value. Conversely, relative endorsement had a negligible impact on correction effectiveness. This suggests perceived relative endorsement may influence belief primarily when other cues of information veracity are unavailable. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1038/s41586-023-06883-y,online searches to evaluate misinformation can increase its perceived veracity,"Considerable scholarly attention has been paid to understanding belief in online misinformation 1,2, with a particular focus on social networks. However, the dominant role of search engines in the information environment remains underexplored, even though the use of online search to evaluate the veracity of information is a central component of media literacy interventions 3–5. Although conventional wisdom suggests that searching online when evaluating misinformation would reduce belief in it, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate this claim. Here, across five experiments, we present consistent evidence that online search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles actually increases the probability of believing them. To shed light on this relationship, we combine survey data with digital trace data collected using a custom browser extension. We find that the search effect is concentrated among individuals for whom search engines return lower-quality information. Our results indicate that those who search online to evaluate misinformation risk falling into data voids, or informational spaces in which there is corroborating evidence from low-quality sources. We also find consistent evidence that searching online to evaluate news increases belief in true news from low-quality sources, but inconsistent evidence that it increases belief in true news from mainstream sources. Our findings highlight the need for media literacy programmes to ground their recommendations in empirically tested strategies and for search engines to invest in solutions to the challenges identified here. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.15206/ajpor.2024.12.1.53,"unraveling the web of health misinformation: exploring the characteristics, emotions, and motivations of misinformation during the covid-19 pandemic","The proliferation of health misinformation gained momentum amidst the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). People stuck in their homes, without work pressure, regardless of health concerns towards personal, family, or peer groups, consistently demanded information. People became engaged with misinformation while attempting to find health information content. This study used the content analysis method and analyzed 1,154 misinformation stories from four prominent signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network during the pandemic. The study finds the five main categories of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These are 1) the severity of the virus, 2) cure, prevention, and treatment, 3) myths and rumors about vaccines, 4) health authorities' guidelines, and 5) personal and social impacts. Various sub-categories supported the content characteristics of these categories. The study also analyzed the emotional valence of health misinformation. It was found that misinformation containing negative sentiments got higher engagement during the pandemic. Positive and neutral sentiment misinformation has less reach. Surprise, fear, and anger/aggressive emotions highly affected people during the pandemic; in general, people and social media users warning people to safeguard themselves from COVID-19 and creating a confusing state were found as the primary motivation behind the propagation of misinformation. The present study offers valuable perspectives on the mechanisms underlying the spread of health-related misinformation amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. It highlights the significance of discerning the accuracy of information and the feelings it conveys in minimizing the adverse effects on the well-being of public health. © 2024, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

Using content analysis on two open-source databases, the study focuses on the strategies deployed by the IRA to emotionally engage the Black community through various platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and personal domains. Findings suggest Russian operations sought to manipulate specific emotions, including love, fear, and anger, which were associated with specific emotional beliefs tied to attachment, vulnerability, and militancy. It further reveals how targeting those emotions could have assisted the advancement of the influence operation. The study’s findings reveal the broader societal implications of these operations, including the potential to provoke offline activities and exacerbate socio-political tensions while underscoring the importance of incorporating the emotional dimension in future studies of influence operations. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

To better understand the audience's perceptions of deepfakes, we ran an online experiment (N = 829) in which participants were randomly exposed to a politician's textual or audio-visual authentic speech or a textual or audio-visual manipulation (a deepfake) where this politician's speech was forged to include a radical right-wing populist narrative. In response to both textual disinformation and deepfakes, we inductively assessed (1) the perceived motivations for expressed doubt and uncertainty in response to disinformation and (2) the accuracy of such judgments. Key findings show that participants have a hard time distinguishing a deepfake from a related authentic video, and that the deepfake's content distance from reality is a more likely cause for doubt than perceived technological glitches. Together, we offer new insights into news users’ abilities to distinguish deepfakes from authentic news, which may inform (targeted) media literacy interventions promoting accurate verification skills among the audience. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1038/s41598-023-50591-6,the social anatomy of climate change denial in the united states,"Using data from Twitter (now X), this study deploys artificial intelligence (AI) and network analysis to map and profile climate change denialism across the United States. We estimate that 14.8% of Americans do not believe in climate change. This denialism is highest in the central and southern U.S. However, it also persists in clusters within states (e.g., California) where belief in climate change is high. Political affiliation has the strongest correlation, followed by level of education, COVID-19 vaccination rates, carbon intensity of the regional economy, and income. The analysis reveals how a coordinated social media network uses periodic events, such as cold weather and climate conferences, to sow disbelief about climate change and science, in general. Donald Trump was the strongest influencer in this network, followed by conservative media outlets and right-wing activists. As a form of knowledge vulnerability, climate denialism renders communities unprepared to take steps to increase resilience. As with other forms of misinformation, social media companies (e.g., X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok) should flag accounts that spread falsehoods about climate change and collaborate on targeted educational campaigns. © The Author(s) 2024.",

While fact-checking is a widely used intervention, we know little about citizen motivations to read fact-checks. We tested theoretical predictions related to accuracy-motivated goals (i.e., seeking to know the truth) versus directionally-motivated goals (i.e., seeking to confirm existing beliefs) by analyzing original survey data (n = 19,037) collected in early April to late May 2022 in nineteen countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. Survey participants read ten statements about the Russian war in Ukraine and could opt to see fact-checks for each of these statements. Results of mixed models for three-level hierarchical data (level 1: statements, level 2: individuals, and level 3: countries) showed that accuracy motivations were better explanations than directional motivations for the decision to read fact-checks about the Russian war in Ukraine. © The Author(s) 2024.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0294471,you must be myths-taken: examining belief in falsehoods during the covid-19 health crisis,"The prevalence of health myths is increasing with the rise of Internet use. Left unaddressed, online falsehoods can lead to harmful behaviours. In times of crisis, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the circulation of many myths is exacerbated, often to varying degrees among different cultures. Singapore is a multicultural hub in Asia with Western and Asian influences. Although several studies have examined health myths from a Western or Eastern perspective, little research has investigated online health falsehoods in a population that is culturally exposed to both. Furthermore, most studies examined myths cross-section-ally instead of capturing trends in myth prevalence over time, particularly during crisis situations. Given these literature gaps, we investigated popular myths surrounding the recent COVID-19 pandemic within the multicultural setting of Singapore, by examining its general population. We further examined changes in myth beliefs over the two-year period during the pandemic, and population demographic differences in myth beliefs. Using randomised sampling, two online surveys of nationally representative samples of adults (aged 21–70 years) residing in Singapore were conducted, the first between October 2020 and February 2021 (N = 949), and the second between March and April 2022 (N = 1084). Results showed that 12.7% to 57.5% of the population were unable to identify various myths, such as COVID-19 was manmade, and that three of these myths persisted significantly over time (increases ranging from 3.9% to 9.8%). However, belief in myths varied across population demographics, with ethnic minorities (Indians and Malays), females, young adults and those with lower education levels being more susceptible to myths than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that current debunking efforts are insufficient to effectively counter misinformation beliefs during health crises. Instead, a post-COVID-19 landscape will require targeted approaches aimed at vulnerable population sub-groups, that also focus on the erroneous beliefs with long staying power.

Here we present a comprehensive theoretical framework of (anti)science belief formation and updating to account for the psychological factors that influence the acceptance or rejection of scientific messages. We experimentally investigated, across 12 countries (N = 6,816), the effectiveness of six inoculation strategies targeting these factors—scientific consensus, trust in scientists, transparent communication, moralization of climate action, accuracy and positive emotions—to fight real-world disinformation about climate science and mitigation actions. While exposure to disinformation had strong detrimental effects on participants’ climate change beliefs (δ = −0.16), affect towards climate mitigation action (δ = −0.33), ability to detect disinformation (δ = −0.14) and pro-environmental behaviour (δ = −0.24), we found almost no evidence for protective effects of the inoculations (all δ < 0.20).

10.1111/ssqu.13298,(mis)informing the public? the public's responsiveness to reliable and unreliable information in illiberal information environments,"Background: Public opinion has a dynamic relationship with policy and real-world outcomes in liberal settings where reliable information is abundant. In these settings, the public continuously updates its opinions with reliable policy-relevant information, and the changes in public opinion go on to affect policy and outcomes. It is unknown whether this dynamic exists in illiberal settings where the public's access to reliable information is heavily restricted. Objectives: This article advances a theory of public opinion's dynamic relationship with policy and outcomes that applies to illiberal settings. Methods: Our study examines a vital public good in one of the world's most restrictive information environments and estimates a dynamic model of relationships among three variables—public opinion, policy, and outcomes—with a focus on public opinion and outcomes as the key dependent variables. The analysis looks at air pollution remediation in 274 Chinese localities. Results: We find that public opinion reacts to objective air pollution outcomes and not to misleading information that downplays air pollution severity, which suggests the public can accurately evaluate the reliability of available information. We also find that local public opinion's impact on local air pollution is substantively meaningful on timescales as short as 1 to 2 years, indicating that the additional policy effort prompted by public opinion change is sufficient to yield tangible real-world outcomes even in the short term. Conclusion: Public opinion has a dynamic relationship with policy and real-world outcomes even in highly illiberal settings. We argue that these findings are likely to generalize across issue domains with outcomes that can be directly observed by the public. © 2023 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.",

Leading verbal suggestions have been shown to give rise to false memories and inaccurate testimonies in children, but only a small body of research exists regarding non-verbal communication. The present study examined whether 5- to 8-year-olds in the UK could be misled about their memory of an event through exposure to leading gestural information, which suggested an incorrect response, using a variety of question and gesture types. Results showed that leading gestures significantly corrupted participants’ memory compared to the control group (MD = 0.60, p < 0.001), with participants being misled by at least one question nearly three-quarters of the time. Questions about peripheral details, and gestures that were more visible and expressive, increased false memory further, with even subtle gestures demonstrating a strong misleading influence. We discuss the implications of these findings for the guidelines governing eyewitness interviews. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1177/20570473231203081,let’s intervene: how platforms can combine media literacy and self-efficacy to fight fake news,"In light of concerns over the spread of so-called “fake news” on social media, organizations, and policymakers have increasingly sought to identify tools that can be used to stem the dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. Some evidence suggests that brief media literacy interventions might serve as an important means of helping social media users discern between “real” and “fake” news headlines. However, empirical research indicates that these effects tend to be relatively modest in magnitude. To that end, this study explored the degree to which epistemic self-efficacy beliefs may be able to positively “boost” media literacy interventions. Specifically, we used a series of 2 × 2 experiments to test the contention that the combinatory effects of epistemic self-efficacy and media literacy interventions will better equip users with the resources necessary to discern between disinformation and objectively produced news content. The results failed to indicate the presence of combinatory effects. We did, however, find initial evidence that epistemic self-efficacy beliefs may be importantly associated with the ability to properly classify both fake and mainstream news content. © The Author(s) 2023.",

We used a four-factor mixed-design experiment to examine fact-checking performances of 144 participants for 36 ambiguous social platform statements, all of which were news statements of social events or of common-sense knowledge collected from the internet and selected through pre-test screening. We measured the participants’ total number of fact-checked statements and their judgment accuracy of those statements. We also measured participants’ decision time for making judgments, and their judgment confidence levels. Participants’ social presence, time pressure, and information involvement were significantly related to the number of statements they fact-checked. Their perceived social presence on a social media platform reduced their fact-checking. Time pressure increased the frequency of fact-checking and weakened the impact of social presence. Participants were less likely to fact-check statements when they had high involvement with the information, due to overconfidence. Statements with high information involvement had longer decision-making times. These findings provide a basis for designing ways to display and push information to increase an individual’s awareness of a need to fact-check ambiguous information in a new social media environment. © The Author(s) 2023.",

We also examined the impact of perceived believability as a mediator and how the mediating effects of perceived believability are moderated by social-status seeking and cognitive fluency. Data were collected from 356 respondents using online questionnaires. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and PROCESS Macro. The results suggest that the joy of missing out (JOMO) and government regulations negatively impact fake news-sharing intention. Source credibility and information quality positively impact fake news-sharing intention. Perceived believability mediates the association between antecedents and fake news-sharing intention. Mediated-moderation analysis show that social status seeking and cognitive fluency also significantly impact fake news-sharing intention. This study enriches the fake news and social media literature, and has managerial implications for marketers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
10.1177/00178969231210215,the effects of authoritative source cue and argument strength of correction tweets on mmr vaccine-related misinformation credibility,"Objectives: This study aimed to examine the joint effect of two core message elements – authoritative source and argument strength – in correction tweets to counter conspiratorial misinformation about the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Design/Method: An online experiment with US residents (N = 404) was conducted in a 2 (authoritative correction sources: layperson vs US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control [CDC]) × 2 (correction argument strength: weak vs strong) design. Results: The results indicate that the correction employing strong arguments and a correction provided by the CDC heightened heuristic processing of the corrective information, which in turn increased the perceived credibility of the conspiratorial misinformation. The effect of the CDC correction on heuristic processing was heightened when it contained weak arguments. Notably, user-generated corrections with weak arguments reduced heuristic processing of the information and contributed to reducing the perceived credibility of the misinformation. Conclusion: Based on the findings, we argue that both communicator- and content-related cues jointly influence how audiences process corrective information. The current study discusses the potency of user-generated social media corrections to counter vaccine misinformation and provides practical implications for how user-generated social media correction can be utilised by health practitioners. Public health organisations should prioritise presenting corrective information in an easily understandable manner, using user-generated content that fosters a sense of connection and engagement with individuals. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1515/9783110799163-010,cognitive vulnerability and the post-truth challenge,"This paper shows how research on our cognitive vulnerability can be helpful in addressing the post-truth challenge, contributing to both understanding and countering it. After explaining the term ""cognitive vulnerability, "" we point out some epistemological implications of the approach, like the dependence of rationality patterns on changing belief networks and symbolic practices. Against this backdrop, we highlight how post-truth discourse, in interaction with psychological, technological, and ideological drivers, destabilizes the epistemic equilibrium of uncertainty, trust and responsibility, thus jeopardizing our epistemic practices and invalidating autoregulatory epistemic functions. The last three sections analyze the destabilizing dynamics in more detail, focusing on the polarization of the public sphere, the social perception of science, and the impact of post-truth discourse on standards of rationality and common sense. In conclusion, proposals are formulated to counteract these trends by stimulating epistemic and structural responsibility, correcting the image of science, and developing guidelines for critical trust. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

10.1007/s12046-023-02300-2,breaking down health fakes: a hybrid dnn model for multi-class classification on a self-constructed dataset,"The proliferation of social media has led to a corresponding increase in online dissemination of health-related information, not all of which is reliable. People may have difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction, particularly when the advice comes from sources outside the medical community. To address this issue, the study proposes two unique algorithms for constructing a multi-class labeled dataset, followed by developing a Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) model for assessing the credibility of online health information. Finally, the performance of HDNN is compared with six Machine Learning (ML) and five Deep Learning (DL) models. HDNN uses Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)’s pre-trained language representations and fine-tuning capabilities in combination with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The findings demonstrate that the suggested model (CNN-LSTM using BERT base) achieves 93% accuracy with an f1-score of 0.91%, whereas the average accuracy of ML and DL models is 82% and 89%. The proposed approach effectively provides significantly better results than other baseline methods. It introduces the possibility of enhancing the online misinformation system by automatically classifying health posts into different classes, thus enabling a safer web-based search experience on health-related issues. © 2023, Indian Academy of Sciences.",
10.1038/s41598-023-33299-5,bypassing misinformation without confrontation improves policy support as much as correcting it,"Curbing the negative impact of misinformation is typically assumed to require correcting misconceptions. Conceivably, however, bypassing the misinformation through alternate beliefs of opposite implications may reduce the attitudinal impact of the misinformation. Three experiments, one preregistered with a sample representative of the United States population, examined the impact of (a) directly correcting prior misinformation offered in support of restricting Genetically Modified (GM) foods (i.e., the correction strategy) and (b) discussing information in support of GM foods (i.e., the bypassing strategy), compared to a misinformation-only control condition. Findings consistently revealed that bolstering beliefs with opposite implications is just as effective at reducing opposition to GM foods as is correcting misinformation about GM foods. Thus, bypassing should be added to our arsenal of methods to curb the impact of misinformation. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.3390/journalmedia4030052,russo-ukrainian war and trust or mistrust in information: a snapshot of individuals’ perceptions in greece,"The purpose of this study was to assess the Greek public’s perceptions of the reliability of information received about the Russo-Ukrainian war in the spring of 2022. The study was conducted through an online questionnaire survey consisting of closed-ended statements on a five-point Likert scale. Principal components analysis was performed on the collected data. The retained principal components (PCs) were subjected to non-hierarchical k-means cluster analysis to group respondents into clusters based on the similarity of perceived outcomes. A total of 840 responses were obtained. Twenty-eight original variables from the questionnaire were summarised into five PCs, explaining 63.0% of the total variance. The majority of respondents felt that the information they had received about the Russo-Ukrainian war was unreliable. Older, educated, professional people with exposure to fake news were sceptical about the reliability of information related to the war. Young adults who were active on social networks and had no detailed knowledge of the events considered information about the war to be reliable. The study found that the greater an individual’s ability to spot fake news, the lower their trust in social media and their information habits on social networks. © 2023 by the authors.",
10.1038/s41598-023-44752-w,"exploring covid-19 conspiracy theories: education, religiosity, trust in scientists, and political orientation in 26 european countries","The COVID-19 virus disseminated globally at an accelerated pace, culminating in a worldwide pandemic; it engendered a proliferation of spurious information and a plethora of misinformation and conspiracy theories (CTs). While many factors contributing to the propensity for embracing conspiracy ideation have been delineated, the foremost determinant influencing individuals’ proclivity towards CT endorsement appears to be their level of educational attainment. This research aimed to assess the moderating effect of religiosity, trust in scientists, and political orientation on the impact of education level on people’s belief in COVID-19-related CTs in Europe by considering both individual-level and country-level contextual covariates of CT. We analysed data from the newest European Social Survey (ESS10) round conducted between September 2020 and September 2022 in 26 countries. We found religiosity weakens, and trust in scientists strengthens the effect of education, while the impact of political orientation is not straightforward. The result also demonstrates a significant negative correlation between the aggregate country-level data of the respondents supporting CTs and the level of vaccination and cumulative excess deaths in Europe. We concluded with a recommendation that planning effective public health strategies and campaigns are insufficient when based solely on people’s education, as individuals’ beliefs moderate the effect of education. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1098/rsos.230417,navigating the covid-19 infodemic: the influence of metacognitive efficiency on health behaviours and policy attitudes,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an infodemic of misinformation and increasing polarization around public health measures, such as social distancing and national lockdowns. In this study, I examined metacognitive efficiency - the extent to which the subjective feeling of knowing predicts the objective accuracy of knowledge - as a tool to understand and measure the assimilation of misleading misinformation in a balanced sample of Great Britain's population (N = 1689), surveyed at the end of the third national lockdown. Using a signal-detection theory approach to quantify metacognitive efficiency, I found that at the population level, metacognitive efficiency for COVID-19 knowledge was impaired compared with general knowledge, indicating a worse alignment between confidence levels and the actual ability to discern true and false statements. Crucially, individual differences in metacognitive efficiency related to COVID-19 knowledge predicted health-protective behaviours, vaccination intentions and attitudes towards public health measures, even after accounting for the level of knowledge itself and demographic covariates, such as education, income and political alignment. These results reveal the significant impact of misinformation on public beliefs and suggest that fostering confidence in accurate knowledge should be a key target for science communication efforts aimed at promoting compliance with public health and social measures.  © 2023 The Authors.",
10.1038/s41562-023-01641-6,understanding and combatting misinformation across 16 countries on six continents,"The spread of misinformation online is a global problem that requires global solutions. To that end, we conducted an experiment in 16 countries across 6 continents (N = 34,286; 676,605 observations) to investigate predictors of susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19, and interventions to combat the spread of this misinformation. In every country, participants with a more analytic cognitive style and stronger accuracy-related motivations were better at discerning truth from falsehood; valuing democracy was also associated with greater truth discernment, whereas endorsement of individual responsibility over government support was negatively associated with truth discernment in most countries. Subtly prompting people to think about accuracy had a generally positive effect on the veracity of news that people were willing to share across countries, as did minimal digital literacy tips. Finally, aggregating the ratings of our non-expert participants was able to differentiate true from false headlines with high accuracy in all countries via the ‘wisdom of crowds’. The consistent patterns we observe suggest that the psychological factors underlying the misinformation challenge are similar across different regional settings, and that similar solutions may be broadly effective. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",
10.3758/s13421-023-01402-w,mechanisms in continued influence: the impact of misinformation corrections on source perceptions,"Research on the continued influence effect (CIE) of misinformation has demonstrated that misinformation continues to influence people’s beliefs and judgments even after it has been corrected. Although most theorizing about the CIE attempts to explain why corrections do not eliminate belief in and influences of the misinformation, the present research takes a different approach and focuses instead on why corrections do reduce belief in misinformation (even if not entirely). We examined how a correction can change perceptions of the original source of the misinformation and how these changes in perceptions can mediate continued influence effects. We also examined causal evidence linking manipulations of misinformation source perceptions to continued belief and misinformation-relevant inferential reasoning. Study 1 demonstrated that an external correction (i.e., a new source labeling misinformation as false) influences perceptions of the misinformation source, and these perceptions of the misinformation source then correlated with belief in the misinformation. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1 and used source derogation to manipulate misinformation source perceptions and further lessen continued belief. Study 3 was a preregistered replication of previous results using new methodology. These studies suggest that perceptions of the misinformation source is one mechanism that can cause changes in belief in misinformation, and changes in the perception of a source can be achieved simply by correcting the source or through other means. This approach can be used to find other mechanisms responsible for reducing belief in misinformation. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",
10.1186/s41235-023-00500-2,combatting rumors around the french election: the memorability and effectiveness of fact-checking articles,"Across four studies, we examined the how design decisions influenced the effectiveness of fact-checking articles created by CrossCheck France during the 2017 French election. We measured both memory for the article and belief in the false rumor. We saw no difference in fact check efficacy based on the type of headline (question vs negation) or the number of newsroom logos present around the article (one, four, or seven). In addition, informative design features such as an icon identifying the type of misinformation were ignored by readers. Participants failed to remember many of the details from the article, but retrieval practice was beneficial in reducing forgetting over a 1-week delay. In both US and French samples, reading the fact check decreased belief in the false information, even 1 week later. However, the articles were much more effective in the US sample, who lacked relevant prior knowledge and political beliefs. Overall, fact-checking articles can be effective at reducing belief in false information, but readers tend to forget the details and ignore peripheral information. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1016/j.datak.2023.102207,an empiric validation of linguistic features in machine learning models for fake news detection,"The diffusion of fake news is a growing problem with a high and negative social impact. There are several approaches to address the detection of fake news. This work focuses on a hybrid approach based on functional linguistic features and machine learning. There are several recent works with this approach. However, there are no clear guidelines on which linguistic features are most appropriate nor how to justify their use. Furthermore, many classification results are modest compared to recent advances in natural language processing. Our proposal considers 88 features organized in surface information, part of speech, discursive characteristics, and readability indices. On a 42 677 news database, we show that the classification results outperform previous work, even outperforming state-of-the-art techniques such as BERT, reaching 99.99% accuracy. A proper selection of linguistic features is crucial for interpretability as well as the performance of the models. In this sense, our proposal contributes to the intentional selection of linguistic features, overcoming current technical issues. We identified 32 features that show differences between the type of news. The results are highly competitive in the classification and simple to implement and interpret. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",
10.1145/3583780.3614914,hipo: detecting fake news via historical and multi-modal analyses of social media posts,"In recent years, fake news has been a primary concern since it plays a significant role in influencing the political, economic, and social spheres. The scientific community has proposed several solutions to detect such fraudulent information. However, such solutions are unsuitable for social media posts since they cannot extract sufficient information from one-line textual and graphical content or are highly dependent on prior knowledge, which may be unavailable in the case of unprecedented events (e.g., breaking news). This paper tackles this issue by proposing HiPo, a novel multimodal historical post-based fake news detection method. By combining the features extracted from the graphical and textual content, HiPo assesses the truthfulness of a social media post by building its historical context from prior off-label posts with high similarity, therefore achieving online detection without maintaining a context or knowledge database. We evaluate the performance of HiPo via an exhaustive set of experiments involving four real-world datasets. Our method achieves a detection accuracy higher than 84%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most experimental instances. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

10.1177/00332941211073656,"acceptance and adherence to covid-19 preventive measures are shaped predominantly by conspiracy beliefs, mistrust in science and fear – a comparison of more than 20 psychological variables","The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic sparked a great interest in psychological factors that determine or explain peoples' responses to the novel threatening situation and the preventive measures (e.g. wearing masks, social distancing). In this study, we focused on contaminated mindware (conspiracy and paranormal beliefs) and investigated its relationship with both acceptance of and adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, along with other variables from the domains of emotion (trait anxiety, fear), traditional personality traits (Big 5, locus of control, optimism/pessimism) and motivation (self-control, dispositional regulatory focus). A total of 22 variables were measured in an online survey (N = 374) that took place during the second wave of COVID-19 (Nov. 2020 – March 2021) in Switzerland. Of all variables, the endorsement of specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was most strongly associated with lower acceptance and adherence to the preventive measures, together with mistrust in science and a more right-wing political orientation. In contrast, fear of COVID-19 and prevention regulatory focus were positively associated with acceptance and adherence. Our results therefore highlight the importance of fighting (conspiratorial) misinformation and of increasing the perceived credibility of science in reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Moreover, when acceptance was used as predictor for adherence, agreeableness and dispositional prevention regulatory focus still explained unique variance in adherence, suggesting that such personality and motivational variables play an important role in adhering and regulating preventive behaviour independent from the attitude towards the preventive measures themselves. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1111/spc3.12902,pandemic precarity: a multi-level study of neoliberal precarity and covid-related outcomes in the united states,"Neoliberalism is the political-economic system that has characterized the United States for the past half century. Structurally, neoliberalism has involved privatization, deregulation, and government divestment from public health systems. Cultural psychologists have begun to outline the ways that neoliberalism is reflected in attitudes, ways of being, and ideologies, such as in the form of heightened individualism, justification of inequality, depoliticization, and precarity. We argue that neoliberal structures and psychologies may contribute to deleterious outcomes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that neoliberalism at the US state level (n = 51) is associated with higher COVID mortality and case fatality rates, as well as lower vaccination rates (Study 1). We also demonstrate that individual-level (n = 8280) neoliberal ideology predicts less adaptive beliefs and attitudes such as the belief that the federal response to the pandemic was too fast and belief in COVID-related misinformation (Study 2). We demonstrate using multilevel modeling that state-level neoliberalism predicts individual-level COVID-related attitudes, which is explained in part by heightened neoliberal ideology in more neoliberal states (Study 2). This study contributes to an understanding of the structural and cultural psychological factors that have contributed to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0293288,iheard stl: development and first year findings from a local surveillance and rapid response system for addressing covid-19 and other health misinformation,"Background The U.S. Surgeon General and others have emphasized a critical need to address COVID-19 misinformation to protect public health. In St. Louis, MO, we created iHeard STL, a community-level misinformation surveillance and response system. This paper reports methods and findings from its first year of operation. Methods We assembled a panel of over 200 community members who answered brief, weekly mobile phone surveys to share information they heard in the last seven days. Based on their responses, we prioritized misinformation threats. Weekly surveillance data, misinformation priorities, and accurate responses to each misinformation threat were shared on a public dashboard and sent to community organizations in weekly alerts. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between panel member characteristics and misinformation exposure and belief. Results In the first year, 214 panel members were enrolled. Weekly survey response rates were high (mean = 88.3% ± 6%). Exposure to a sample of COVID-19 misinformation items did not differ significantly by panel member age category or gender; however, African American panel members had significantly higher reported odds of exposure and belief/uncertain belief in some misinformation items (ORs from 3.4 to 17.1) compared to white panel members. Conclusions Our first-year experience suggests that this systematic, community-based approach to assessing and addressing misinformation is feasible, sustainable, and a promising strategy for responding to the threat of health misinformation. In addition, further studies are needed to understand whether structural factors such as medical mistrust underly the observed racial differences in exposure and belief. © 2023 Johnson et al.

10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad286,high level of correspondence across different news domain quality rating sets,"One widely used approach for quantifying misinformation consumption and sharing is to evaluate the quality of the news domains that a user interacts with. However, different media organizations and fact-checkers have produced different sets of news domain quality ratings, raising questions about the reliability of these ratings. In this study, we compared six sets of expert ratings and found that they generally correlated highly with one another. We then created a comprehensive set of domain ratings for use by the research community (github.com/hauselin/domain-quality-ratings), leveraging an ensemble “wisdom of experts” approach. To do so, we performed imputation together with principal component analysis to generate a set of aggregate ratings. The resulting rating set comprises 11,520 domains-the most extensive coverage to date-and correlates well with other rating sets that have more limited coverage. Together, these results suggest that experts generally agree on the relative quality of news domains, and the aggregate ratings that we generate offer a powerful research tool for evaluating the quality of news consumed or shared and the efficacy of misinformation interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1186/s41235-023-00492-z,examining the replicability of backfire effects after standalone corrections,"Corrections are a frequently used and effective tool for countering misinformation. However, concerns have been raised that corrections may introduce false claims to new audiences when the misinformation is novel. This is because boosting the familiarity of a claim can increase belief in that claim, and thus exposing new audiences to novel misinformation—even as part of a correction—may inadvertently increase misinformation belief. Such an outcome could be conceptualized as a familiarity backfire effect, whereby a familiarity boost increases false-claim endorsement above a control-condition or pre-correction baseline. Here, we examined whether standalone corrections—that is, corrections presented without initial misinformation exposure—can backfire and increase participants’ reliance on the misinformation in their subsequent inferential reasoning, relative to a no-misinformation, no-correction control condition. Across three experiments (total N = 1156) we found that standalone corrections did not backfire immediately (Experiment 1) or after a one-week delay (Experiment 2). However, there was some mixed evidence suggesting corrections may backfire when there is skepticism regarding the correction (Experiment 3). Specifically, in Experiment 3, we found the standalone correction to backfire in open-ended responses, but only when there was skepticism towards the correction. However, this did not replicate with the rating scales measure. Future research should further examine whether skepticism towards the correction is the first replicable mechanism for backfire effects to occur. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1371/journal.pone.0294681,attentive immobility: investigating the emotional-cognitive mechanism underlying conspiracy mentality and covid-19 preventive behaviors,"While conspiracy theories have received extensive attention in the realm of misinformation, there has been limited research exploring the impact of conspiracy mentality on individuals’ preventive behaviors during acute public health crises. This study investigates how conspiracy mentality may affect compliance with preventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the underlying emotional and cognitive mediators. Data was collected through a survey among 1878 Chinese respondents at the conclusion of the pandemic. The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality are significantly less engaged in preventive behaviors. Furthermore, this correlation is mediated by a sequence of mediating factors, starting from anger leading to institutional distrust and fear leading to perceived risk. Conspiracists’ response mode can be described as a state of ""attentive immobility,"" in which the impact of heightened institutional distrust outweighs their perceptions of risk, ultimately reducing engagement in preventive behaviors during crises. These findings underscore the importance of debunking initiatives that aim to address and mitigate the negative consequences of conspiracy mentality by targeting the mediating psychological processes during future pandemic threats. © 2023 Zhao et al.",
10.1016/j.ssmqr.2023.100308,perceptions of government guidance and citizen responses during the covid-19 pandemic: a cross-country analysis,"The public perception of government approaches to pandemic management has played an important role in citizen responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the state and associated health institutions should feasibly be sources of epistemic authority, the pandemic has undermined their legitimacy as anti-science rhetoric proliferated and ‘fake news’ spread rapidly. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of interviews with citizens across four different countries and explore how a lack of consistency and clarity in public health guidance from government and other trusted institutions led to a polarisation in public perceptions and mixed understandings of the pandemic. Using interview data collected across Brazil, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, we explored whether there were differences in the extent to which both state governments and scientific institutions were perceived as epistemic authorities through managing the pandemic. Participants grappled with a distrust of government guidelines, finding alternative sources of information to manage perceived infection risk, and make decisions around self-medication. Our analysis suggests several components were key to maintaining trust – and therefore epistemic authority – during the pandemic: reliability of the information delivered by different government bodies, including clarity of messaging; reliability of the government bodies themselves, including whether officials conducted themselves appropriately; and honesty about claims to expertise, including communicating when the scientific evidence was unclear or inconclusive. Our data suggests that honest communication about the limits of their knowledge would assist governments in engendering trust among citizens, and theoretically, compliance with public health guidelines. © 2023 The Authors",
10.3390/socsci12090470,preventing prejudice emerging from misleading news among adolescents: the role of implicit activation and regulatory self-efficacy in dealing with online misinformation,"This paper explores the possibility of preventing prejudice among adolescents by promoting the analytical processing of social media content emerging from racial misinformation. Specifically, we propose, at this aim, an intervention that centers on recognizing stereotypical beliefs and other media biases about a group of people in misleading news. To better understand the variables that contribute to improving socio-analytical performance in the face of such misinformation, we investigated the influence of implicit associations as a tendency toward the automatic labeling of groups, as well as two dimensions of perceived self-efficacy in the face of misinformation, one active and one inhibitory. Our results demonstrate the presence of a negative link between affective prejudice and socio-analytical processing, and that this analytical performance toward misleading news is negatively related to the individual tendency toward implicit activation, and is also explained by the inhibitory factor of the perceived efficacy toward misinformation. The role of the active factor related to the perceived ability of fact-checking is not significant. This research suggests that education focused on the socio-analytical processing of misleading news in social media feeds can be an effective means of intervening in online affective prejudice among adolescents; the implications and limitations of our findings for future research in this area are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.",

Personal ideologies—including religiosity and political leanings (i.e., conservative, liberal)—have heavily guided responses to the pandemic, particularly in the Southern United States. However, microenvironments like Southern U.S. universities provide a unique perspective into the juxtaposition of larger societal conservatism and the liberalism associated with higher education. In the current study, we examined Southern university students' political beliefs, religiosity, and social media exposure in association with their COVID-19 attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors. Participants' political beliefs were associated with their COVID-19 concern, myth acceptance, vaccination status, and likelihood to receive a future vaccination. Religiosity and social media exposure were more nuanced. Future research into personal ideologies as emerging adults develop their independent identities away from their parents, and how this process can impact health behaviors, is needed. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116263,believing in conspiracy theories in spain during the covid-19 pandemic: drivers and public health implications,"Conspiracy theories jeopardize public health by disseminating misinformation and undermining authoritative health guidelines. This study explores social factors associated with the belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon the theoretical framework of Max Weber, it posits that beliefs in conspiracy theories are linked to both instrumental rationality considerations, such as trust in health authorities, science, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as value-rationality based factors, such as ideological orientation. The study analyzes recent, nationally representative survey data and is the first to examine the social predictors of belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the pandemic. The findings highlight that conspiracy theory beliefs are (a) associated with considerably worse vaccination behaviors, (b) not or only very weakly associated with standard demographics such as age, sex, or education, (c) related to instrumental rationality considerations, and (d) only weakly related to value-rationality indicators such as ideological and religious affiliations. In conclusion, the study underscores the significance of public health policies that specifically address conspiracy theory convictions, and to that end, advocates for the application of a Weberian sociological perspective to better understand the diverse rationalities underlying these beliefs, particularly in the absence of discernible demographic predictors. © 2023 The Authors",
10.1186/s40359-023-01425-7,trust in information sources as a moderator of the impact of covid-19 anxiety and exposure to information on conspiracy thinking and misinformation beliefs: a multilevel study,"This study investigates the intricate relationship between exposure to information sources, trust in these sources, conspiracy and misinformation beliefs, and COVID-19 anxiety among 509 Omani citizens aged 11 to 50, representing 11 governorates. Employing structural equation modeling, we not only examine these associations but also explore how trust and COVID-19 anxiety act as moderating variables in this context. Additionally, we delve into demographic factors such as age group, educational level, gender, and place of residence (governorate) to discern potential variations. Our findings reveal that trust in health experts is inversely related to belief in conspiracy theories, while trust in health experts negatively correlates with exposure to conspiracy and misinformation. Intriguingly, trust in health experts exhibits divergent effects across governorates: it diminishes conspiracy and misinformation beliefs in some regions but not in others. Exposure to personal contacts and digital media, on the other hand, is associated with heightened beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories, respectively, in select governorates. These distinctions may be attributed to proximity to Muscat, the capital city of Oman, where various media outlets and policy-making institutions are situated. Furthermore, lower educational attainment is linked to greater belief in conspiracy and misinformation. Females reported higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs and COVID-19 anxiety while no significant differences were detected in misinformation beliefs. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of misinformation and conspiracy theories in the context of COVID-19 in Oman, highlighting the pivotal roles of trust and COVID-19 anxiety as moderating factors. These findings offer valuable insights into understanding and addressing the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories during a public health crisis. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1177/20531680231193514,by any memes necessary: belief- and chaos-driven motives for sharing conspiracy theories on social media,"Although a growing body of scholarship examines who believes conspiracy theories (CTs) and why, less is known about why people share CTs. We test the impact of three independent motives on people’s willingness to share CTs on social media: bolstering their or their group’s beliefs (motivated sharing), generating collective action against their political outgroup because of losing (sounding the alarm), and mobilizing others against the political system (need for chaos). Using an original survey of US adults (N = 3336), we test these three motives together and find strong evidence for motivated sharing and need for chaos, but no evidence for sounding the alarm. Our findings suggest that motivated sharing—when measured directly as belief in the CTs—is the strongest predictor of willingness to share CTs on social media. Need for chaos has less of an effect on sharing than belief but a consistently stronger effect on sharing than partisanship and ideology. Altogether, we demonstrate that sharing CTs on social media can serve both motivated and mobilizing functions, particularly for those who believe the CTs or seek to challenge the political system, rather than impugn their political rivals. © The Author(s) 2023.",

With a deep affinity with democracy, civil society became a reliable bulwark against abuses of power and endemic corruption. However, it came under attack under the populist, illiberal Duterte administration (2016–2022) through intimidation, persecution, massive disinformation, and even outright violence. This article examines why Philippine civil society – despite its attempted pushback against democratic erosion – was generally neutralized by Duterte. Apart from its weakened state given polarizing elite conflicts in the 2000s, Duterte engaged in executive assaults against civil society through the four strategies of exploiting divisions within civil society; securitizing public; regulating civic space to weed out opposition voices; and controlling the media environment. This article concludes by examining the implications of a weakened civil society and prospects for its reinvigoration under a restored Marcos dynasty, which won the 2022 Philippine presidential elections. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.2478/bjlp-2023-0006,resilience and vulnerabilities related to russia's invasion of ukraine: the emergence of a new club of nato and eu members,"This article compares and contrasts macro- and micro-foundational explanations about disinformation and resilience in Europe as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine. It presents micro-level data about the shifting public opinion in Europe after Russia's invasion in Ukraine on Feb 24, 2022 on the topics of NATO and EU support and favorability, sympathy for Ukraine and condemnation of Russia, including support for sanctions against Moscow (Pew Research Center 2021, 2022). The study compares and contrasts traditional macro-level analytical frameworks such as deterrence, institutionalization and adaptation. I argue that a combination of macro- (or institutional) and micro-level factors (associated with the idiosyncrasies of the domestic public opinion) best explain the shifting attitudes since the beginning of the War in Ukraine. Against the backdrop of NATO and the EU's increased resilience, a new group or sub-club of ""vulnerable""allies has emerged among some central and east European nations. The article evaluates different constraints and vulnerabilities and makes recommendations how to reduce misinformation and contestation in these states.  © 2023 Ivan Dinev Ivanov.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116132,hope over fear: the interplay between threat information and hope appeal corrections in debunking early covid-19 misinformation,"The spreading of COVID-19 misinformation paralleled increasing fear towards the pandemic reported worldwide in its early stages. Yet research on the emotional basis for misinformation susceptibility and how emotional appeals may help reduce COVID-19 related misperceptions remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a 2 (threat from COVID-19: yes vs. no) × 4 (correction conditions: none vs. factual correction vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook & individual efficacy vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook & collective efficacy) between-participant factorial experiment among an online sample of Chinese residents (N = 836) in June 2020. Misinformation about COVID-19 treatments and mitigation was presented in all conditions. Across five misinformation topics, threat information induced more misperceptions while all three types of corrections mitigated threat information's deleterious impact and improved belief accuracy. Importantly, corrections incorporating hope appeals showed enhanced effectiveness in improving belief accuracy when threat information was present whereas factual corrections absent hope appeals did not show similar sensitivity towards threat information. For hope appeal corrections, their indirect effects on desirable downstream behavioral intentions through corrected beliefs were stronger with than without preceding threat information. Our study thus demonstrated the potential of deploying hope appeals to fight the COVID-19 infodemic in China and beyond when threat information is prevalent, while highlighting the importance of studying the roles of emotional appeals in health misperception formation and correction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122746,covid-19 fake news detection: a hybrid cnn-bilstm-am model,"With the rapid development of technology, social media as a communication platform has caused a significant increase in the dissemination of false information and fake news. We propose an outlier knowledge management framework of “generation–spread–identification–refutation” for detecting fake news in emergencies based on the theory of complex adaptive systems and information transmission. We extract and acquire outlier knowledge of COVID-19 fake news, incorporate it into the outlier knowledge base of major emergencies for knowledge sharing and transformation, classify the acquired knowledge from three dimensions (people, organization, and technology), and develop wisdom according to the extracted knowledge. Our proposed hybrid model is based on Convolutional Neural Network, Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Network, and Attention Mechanism (AM) for fake news detection, thereby improving the evaluation indicators of Loss, Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall by at least 1 %. The multi-head AM performs better in fake news detection when models with different AMs are adjusted, and significant differences in sentence length and topic distribution can be observed between real and fake news. The model provides a think tank and a platform for public opinion guidance to deal with major emergency news detection. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",
10.1027/1016-9040/a000498,the misinformation receptivity framework: political misinformation and disinformation as cognitive bayesian inference problems,"Evaluating the truthfulness of new information is a difficult and complex task. Notably, there is currently no unified theoretical framework that addresses the questions of (1) how individuals discern whether political information is true or (deliberately) false, (2) under what conditions individuals are most susceptible to believing misinformation, and (3) how the structure of political and communicative environments skews cognitive processes of truth, discernment, and interpretation generation. To move forward, we propose the Misinformation Receptivity Framework (MRF). Building on Bayesian and probabilistic models of cognition, the MRF suggests that we can conceptualize misinformation receptivity as a cognitive inference problem in which the reliability of incoming misinformation is weighed against the reliability of prior beliefs. This reliability-weighting process can model when individuals adopt or reject misinformation, as well as the ways in which they creatively generate interpretations rather than passively discern truth versus falsehood. Moreover, certain communication contexts can lead people to rely excessively on incoming (mis)information or conversely to rely excessively on prior beliefs. The MRF postulates how such environmental properties can heighten the persuasiveness of different kinds of misinformation. For instance, the MRF predicts that noisy communication contexts, in which the reliability of inputs is ambiguous, make people susceptible to highly partisan and ideological misinformation or disinformation that amplifies their existing belief systems. By contrast, the MRF predicts that contextual instability renders people susceptible to misinformation that would be considered extreme or worldview-incongruent in conditions of stability. The MRF formally delineates the interactions between cognitive and communicative mechanisms, offering insights and testable hypotheses on when, how, and why different kinds of misinformation proliferate. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.",

Retrieval practice is one way to increase memory, thus multiple-choice quizzes may be a useful tool for fact-checkers. We tested whether exposure to quizzes improved people’s accuracy ratings for fact-checked claims and their memory for specific information within a fact check. Across three experiments, 1551 US-based online participants viewed fact checks (either health- or politics-related) with or without a quiz. Overall, the fact checks were effective, and participants were more accurate in rating the claims after exposure. In addition, quizzes improved participants’ memory for the details of the fact checks, even 1 week later. However, that increased memory did not lead to more accurate beliefs. Participants’ accuracy ratings were similar in the quiz and no-quiz conditions. Multiple-choice quizzes can be a useful tool for increasing memory, but there is a disconnect between memory and belief. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.3390/soc13110242,fake news in the post-covid-19 era? the health disinformation agenda in spain,"Three years after a pandemic that demonstrated the importance of reliable health information in a news agenda dominated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we analyze the situation of health disinformation in Spain on the basis of the verifications carried out by its main fact-checking platforms. The results show that COVID-19 shared center stage with other topics in the health area. In addition, a unique agenda is evident in each situation in the study, indicating a fact-checking strategy that is differentiated according to the media outlet and type of specialization (generalist fact-checker or one specialized in health). Vaccination, nutrition, and disease treatment emerge as the most important thematic subfields. Most health hoaxes are manufactured, i.e., created from scratch, rather than being manipulated or reconfigured from real preexisting elements. The format of text and image together predominates, and new social networks (TikTok or Telegram) have appeared as platforms for the circulation of hoaxes. This indicates that providing necessary health literacy to society and giving health issues greater presence in current fact-checking agendas are strategies for combatting disinformation, which can have serious consequences, regardless of whether there is a public health crisis such as the one experienced recently. © 2023 by the authors.",
10.3758/s13423-023-02321-2,thinking false and slow: implausible beliefs and the cognitive reflection test,"Why do people believe implausible claims like conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and fake news? Past studies using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) suggest that implausible beliefs may result from an unwillingness to effortfully process information (i.e., cognitive miserliness). Our analysis (N = 664) tests this account by comparing CRT performance (total score, number and proportion of incorrect intuitive responses, and completion time) for endorsers and non-endorsers of implausible claims. Our results show that endorsers performed worse than non-endorsers on the CRT, but they took significantly longer to answer the questions and did not make proportionally more intuitive mistakes. Endorsers therefore appear to process information effortfully but nonetheless score lower on the CRT. Poorer overall CRT performance may not necessarily indicate that those who endorse implausible beliefs have a more reflexive, intuitive, or non-analytical cognitive style than non-endorsers. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1038/s41598-023-39944-3,deepfakes and scientific knowledge dissemination,"Science misinformation on topics ranging from climate change to vaccines have significant public policy repercussions. Artificial intelligence-based methods of altering videos and photos (deepfakes) lower the barriers to the mass creation and dissemination of realistic, manipulated digital content. The risk of exposure to deepfakes among education stakeholders has increased as learners and educators rely on videos to obtain and share information. We field the first study to understand the vulnerabilities of education stakeholders to science deepfakes and the characteristics that moderate vulnerability. We ground our study in climate change and survey individuals from five populations spanning students, educators, and the adult public. Our sample is nationally representative of three populations. We found that 27–50% of individuals cannot distinguish authentic videos from deepfakes. All populations exhibit vulnerability to deepfakes which increases with age and trust in information sources but has a mixed relationship with political orientation. Adults and educators exhibit greater vulnerability compared to students, indicating that those providing education are especially susceptible. Vulnerability increases with exposure to potential deepfakes, suggesting that deepfakes become more pernicious without interventions. Our results suggest that focusing on the social context in which deepfakes reside is one promising strategy for combatting deepfakes. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1111/spc3.12797,personal need for structure as a protective factor on beliefs and coping with covid-19: a crowd-sourced multicultural exploration,"A pre-registered, crowd-sourced, multicultural study assessed how the personal need for structure (PNFS) predicted perceptions, behaviors, and coping mechanisms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Collaborators, invited to collect online survey data through Psi Chi's Network for International Collaborative Exchange crowd-sourcing initiative (Edlund et al., 2019), recruited approximately 100 participants across 22 data-collection locations (final N = 4620). Participants completed randomized online surveys, which inquired about an individual's PNFS, and current perceptions, behaviors and knowledge surrounding the pandemic. Results indicated that individuals with higher PNFS fared better at navigating the rules and restrictions that came with the pandemic. Specifically, and contrary to hypotheses, higher PNFS positively predicted knowledge of COVID-19 and support for government restrictions and negatively predicted belief in pandemic misinformation. Additionally, PNFS significantly positively predicted the use of problem and emotion-focused coping strategies and did not predict dysfunctional coping mechanisms. Our findings emphasize the role individual differences play in navigating the pandemic, and future research should evaluate PNFS in light of COVID-19 and in relation to other behavioral and psychological outcomes. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1038/s41598-023-30867-7,a prosocial fake news intervention with durable effects,"The present online intervention promoted family-based prosocial values—in terms of helping family members—among young adults to build resistance against fake news. This preregistered randomized controlled trial study is among the first psychological fake news interventions in Eastern Europe, where the free press is weak and state-sponsored misinformation runs riot in mainstream media. In this intervention, participants were endowed with an expert role and requested to write a letter to their digitally less competent relatives explaining six strategies that help fake news recognition. Compared to the active control group there was an immediate effect (d = 0.32) that persisted until the follow-up four weeks later (d = 0.22) on fake news accuracy ratings of the young, advice-giving participants. The intervention also reduced the bullshit receptivity of participants both immediately after the intervention and in the long run. The present work demonstrates the power of using relevant social bonds for motivating behavior change among Eastern European participants. Our prosocial approach with its robust grounding in human psychology might complement prior interventions in the fight against misinformation. © 2023, The Author(s).",

Updating science-relevant misinformation after a correction can be challenging, and little is known about what theoretical factors can influence the correction. Here this meta-analysis examined 205 effect sizes (that is, k, obtained from 74 reports; N = 60,861), which showed that attempts to debunk science-relevant misinformation were, on average, not successful (d = 0.19, P = 0.131, 95% confidence interval −0.06 to 0.43). However, corrections were more successful when the initial science-relevant belief concerned negative topics and domains other than health. Corrections fared better when they were detailed, when recipients were likely familiar with both sides of the issue ahead of the study and when the issue was not politically polarized. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

It advances an emotion-centered approach to understanding misinformation by examining how different conceptualizations of emotions, such as core affect and dimensional approaches, discrete emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety, fear), feelings-as-information, and intuition, are applied to investigate the spread and belief of false information online. The chapter also discusses how emotions impact the effectiveness of corrections to falsehoods. It concludes with a call to place more emphasis on emotions in misinformation research, offering a series of unanswered questions about emotion and misinformation to be addressed in future work.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116187,understanding and managing the self-wise during a healthcare crisis,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an interesting yet worrisome phenomenon to the fore. A segment of the population, which we call the Self-Wise, seems to exhibit an inflated sense of self-expertise relative to domain experts, which – combined with a lack of trust in the latter – leads them to ignore or reject expert advice. We argue and demonstrate that this phenomenon is distinct from other “illusory superiority” phenomena, most notably Dunning-Kruger and Lake Wobegon. Three studies with US participants provide compelling evidence for the existence of the Self-Wise phenomenon. In the context of COVID-19, its behavioral consequences are non-compliance with expert-based COVID-19 guidelines and measures (e.g., wearing a mask and getting vaccinated). The studies also provide insight into additional characteristics of the Self-Wise, which can be used for identification and targeting purposes. We tested the effectiveness of two tailored interventions that aimed at reducing this segment's “illusory superiority” and (re-)establishing their trust in medical experts. The interventions proved effective in terms of reducing the “illusory superiority” of the Self-Wise, and generally enhanced the participants' intention to comply with COVID-19 guidelines. However, to substantially change the non-conforming COVID-19 behavior of the Self-Wise likely requires stronger and sustained mitigation strategies or interventions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1016/j.tsc.2023.101354,developing critical thinking skills through gamification,"Misinformation as well as the proliferation of fake news has been a problem during COVID-19 pandemic. This has affected many vulnerable communities in Brazil. The ability to understand and sort out pieces of reliable information and fake news has become a fundamental cognitive skill. In this study we report on the development of a serious game (a card-based role-playing game) using Brazilian folk heroes aimed to develop critical thinking skills to empower vulnerable communities affected by misinformation and fake news. Four groups located in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) participated in this research: one group of people experiencing homelessness; two groups of favela residents (one urban and one in the suburbs) and one group of recyclable material collectors from a cooperative. We gained entry and built trust with each of these groups and worked together for 10 months during the pandemic. We conducted participatory observations, individual interviews with each participant and discussed their daily interaction with information, specifically in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. The analyses of the observations and interview data gave us a glimpse of the communicative needs of the groups. Inserting players into a narrative where they can make decisions based on critical thinking and their own reflections on the pandemic was important for building knowledge and developing critical thinking in these communities. The nature of the game (interactive and cooperative) allowed participants to focus on problem-solving skills and group work. It encouraged them to use real-life knowledge and skills to solve the fictional problems presented by the narrative. © 2023",

However, effective intervention measures to combat misinformation are lacking. The inoculation theory has become a prevalent measure of misinformation. This study employed inoculation theory and developed an interactive game to help the public counter misinformation. In this game, players take on the role of the misinformation spreader, intending to add more followers to their virtual accounts using different strategies. A total of 180 Chinese participants were randomly assigned to game-based inoculation, graphic-based inoculation, and control groups. The results indicated that both types of inoculation interventions significantly decreased the perceived credibility and sharing intention of misinformation. Game-based inoculation was more effective than graphic-based inoculation in terms of misinformation perceived credibility, and the intervention effects were stable after 2 weeks. The graphic-based inoculation contained the sleeper effect, which interventions required a period of time to take effect. Neither inoculation produced countereffects on perceived credibility and nor sharing intention of accurate information. © 2023, The Author(s).",

This study examines over 5 million Wikipedia articles to assess the reliability of references in multiple language editions. We quantify the cross-lingual patterns of the perennial sources list, a collection of reliability labels for web domains identified and collaboratively agreed upon by Wikipedia editors. We discover that some sources (or web domains) deemed untrustworthy in one language (i.e., English) continue to appear in articles in other languages. This trend is especially evident with sources tailored for smaller communities. Furthermore, non-authoritative sources found in the English version of a page tend to persist in other language versions of that page. We finally present a case study on the Chinese, Russian, and Swedish Wikipedias to demonstrate a discrepancy in reference reliability across cultures.

NA,in the dark: the scapegoating of renewables after grid failures,"Renewable energy is increasingly scapegoated as the primary cause of weather-related power outages and other grid failures, despite substantial evidence to the contrary. Disinformation campaigns framing renewables as unreliable are driven by two factors: the increasing frequency of power outages and the growing pressures facing fossil fuel energy stakeholders. Over the past decade, power outages in the United States have doubled, primarily due to increased extreme weather, aging energy infrastructure, and a rapidly changing resource mix. At the same time, the energy transition is placing unprecedented competitive pressure on the coal and gas industry and on the nation’s utilities. These factors are driving fossil fuel stakeholders and their allies to increasingly make renewables the scapegoat for large-scale blackouts and other grid-related challenges. As the scapegoating after recent power outages in Texas and California shows, such disinformation campaigns can shift blame for grid failures away from responsible parties, bolster policies that perpetuate the nation’s reliance on carbon-heavy energy sources and justify unwarranted investments in outdated energy infrastructure. This article highlights this trend and its adverse impacts and suggests several potential strategies for addressing it, including government-sponsored information campaigns and the possibility of creating a new federal agency focused on promoting accuracy and transparency in energy-related messaging. © 2023, University of New Mexico.

10.1371/journal.pone.0291668,do deepfake videos undermine our epistemic trust? a thematic analysis of tweets that discuss deepfakes in the russian invasion of ukraine,"Deepfakes are a form of multi-modal media generated using deep-learning technology. Many academics have expressed fears that deepfakes present a severe threat to the veracity of news and political communication, and an epistemic crisis for video evidence. These commentaries have often been hypothetical, with few real-world cases of deepfake’s political and epistemological harm. The Russo-Ukrainian war presents the first real-life example of deepfakes being used in warfare, with a number of incidents involving deepfakes of Russian and Ukrainian government officials being used for misinformation and entertainment. This study uses a thematic analysis on tweets relating to deepfakes and the Russo-Ukrainian war to explore how people react to deepfake content online, and to uncover evidence of previously theorised harms of deepfakes on trust. We extracted 4869 relevant tweets using the Twitter API over the first seven months of 2022. We found that much of the misinformation in our dataset came from labelling real media as deepfakes. Novel findings about deepfake scepticism emerged, including a connection between deepfakes and conspiratorial beliefs that world leaders were dead and/or replaced by deepfakes. This research has numerous implications for future research, societal media platforms, news media and governments. The lack of deepfake literacy in our dataset led to significant misunderstandings of what constitutes a deepfake, showing the need to encourage literacy in these new forms of media. However, our evidence demonstrates that efforts to raise awareness around deepfakes may undermine trust in legitimate videos. Consequentially, news media and governmental agencies need to weigh the benefits of educational deepfakes and pre-bunking against the risks of undermining truth. Similarly, news companies and media should be careful in how they label suspected deepfakes in case they cause suspicion for real media. © 2023 Twomey et al.

Two studies with representative samples from Sweden (Study 1, N = 1005) and the UK (Study 2, N = 417) disentangled two forms of truth relativism: subjectivism (truth is relative to subjective intuitions) and cultural relativism (truth is relative to cultural context). In Study 1, subjectivism was more strongly associated with receptivity to pseudo-profound bullshit and conspiracy theories than cultural relativism was. In Study 2 (preregistered), subjectivism predicted higher receptivity to both forms of misinformation over and above effects of analytical and actively open-minded thinking, profoundness receptivity, ideology, and demographics; the unique effects of cultural relativism were in the opposite direction (Study 1) or non-significant (Study 2). © 2023 The Authors",
10.1038/s41562-023-01691-w,from alternative conceptions of honesty to alternative facts in communications by us politicians,"The spread of online misinformation on social media is increasingly perceived as a problem for societal cohesion and democracy. The role of political leaders in this process has attracted less research attention, even though politicians who ‘speak their mind’ are perceived by segments of the public as authentic and honest even if their statements are unsupported by evidence. By analysing communications by members of the US Congress on Twitter between 2011 and 2022, we show that politicians’ conception of honesty has undergone a distinct shift, with authentic belief speaking that may be decoupled from evidence becoming more prominent and more differentiated from explicitly evidence-based fact speaking. We show that for Republicans—but not Democrats—an increase in belief speaking of 10% is associated with a decrease of 12.8 points of quality (NewsGuard scoring system) in the sources shared in a tweet. In contrast, an increase in fact-speaking language is associated with an increase in quality of sources for both parties. Our study is observational and cannot support causal inferences. However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the current dissemination of misinformation in political discourse is linked to an alternative understanding of truth and honesty that emphasizes invocation of subjective belief at the expense of reliance on evidence. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.5430/wjel.v13n8p615,social network misinformation and attitudinal shift: a sociolinguistic perspective,"This paper attempts to investigate the extent to which linguistic misinformation via social networking platforms affects an attitudinal shift on the part of Saudis in terms of the social, political, and religious issues propagated by the various social networks. This study delves into the verbal and nonverbal linguistic strategies employed to influence the cognitive background of Saudis as well as their ideological beliefs in a way that targets a shift in their attitudinal behavior, socially, politically, and religiously. The paper analytically covers two linguistic dimensions of using language to influence others, either persuasively or manipulatively: the lexical level, which focuses on the lexical choices of particular words that serve to create a specific attitudinal shift in the recipients’ personalities, and the pragmatic level, which constitutes the intended meaning of speakers or writers that lies beyond the surface propositional meaning of the linguistic expression. To achieve its objective, the paper draws on two analytical strands: critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the social cognitive theory (SCT). The paper has three main findings: first, language is a rhetorical device for influencing the public’s political, social, and religious views, and, therefore, the rhetorical power of the word significantly contributes to attitudes shift; second, misinformation propagated via social networks influences the attitudinal behavior of recipients, particularly at the social level; and, third, social platforms are ideology conduits via which various meanings targeting attitudes shift are communicated. © World Journal of English Language.All rights reserved.",

Gamified “inoculation” interventions have shown promise in improving people’s ability to recognize manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation, but so far few interventions exist that tackle multimodal misinformation (e.g., videos, images). We developed a game called Cat Park, in which players learn about five manipulation techniques (trolling, emotional manipulation, amplification, polarization, and conspiracism), and how misinformation can spread through images. To test the game’s efficacy, we conducted a conceptual replication (N = 380) of Roozenbeek and van der Linden’s 2020 study about Harmony Square, with the same study design, item set, and hypotheses. Like the original study, we find that people who play Cat Park find misinformation significantly less reliable post-gameplay (d = 0.95, p < 0.001) compared to a control group, and are significantly less willing to share misinformation with people in their network (d = 0.54, p < 0.001). These effects are robust across different covariates. However, unlike the original study, Cat Park players do not become significantly more confident in their ability to identify misinformation (p = 0.204, d = − 0.13). We did not find that the game increases people’s self-reported motivation and confidence to counter misinformation online. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",

We examined the relevance of actively open-minded thinking, need for cognition, analyticity, and dogmatism in determining the truthfulness of security and defence news headlines. Drawing from a sample of 500 participants from Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, our results align closely with effect sizes documented in mainstream literature concerning belief in fake news (BFN). In contrast, none of the tested cognitive style measures predicted belief in real news (BRN), and the cognitive reflection test yielded no usable results.

10.1145/3583780.3614841,designing and evaluating presentation strategies for fact-checked content,"With the rapid growth of online misinformation, it is crucial to have reliable fact-checking methods. Recent research on finding check-worthy claims and automated fact-checking have made significant advancements. However, limited guidance exists regarding the presentation of fact-checked content to effectively convey verified information to users. We address this research gap by exploring the critical design elements in fact-checking reports and investigating whether credibility and presentation-based design improvements can enhance users' ability to interpret the report accurately. We co-developed potential content presentation strategies through a workshop involving fact-checking professionals, communication experts, and researchers. The workshop examined the significance and utility of elements such as veracity indicators and explored the feasibility of incorporating interactive components for enhanced information disclosure. Building on the workshop outcomes, we conducted an online experiment involving 76 crowd workers to assess the efficacy of different design strategies. The results indicate that proposed strategies significantly improve users' ability to accurately interpret the verdict of fact-checking articles. Our findings underscore the critical role of effective presentation of fact reports in addressing the spread of misinformation. By adopting appropriate design enhancements, the effectiveness of fact-checking reports can be maximized, enabling users to make informed judgments. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

10.1371/journal.pone.0288188,deliberative panels as a source of public knowledge: a large-sample test of the citizens’ initiative review,"Evolving US media and political systems, coupled with escalating misinformation campaigns, have left the public divided over objective facts featured in policy debates. The public also has lost much of its confidence in the institutions designed to adjudicate those epistemic debates. To counter this threat, civic entrepreneurs have devised institutional reforms to revitalize democratic policymaking. One promising intervention is the Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR), which has been adopted into law in Oregon and tested in several other states, as well as Switzerland and Finland. Each CIR gathers a demographically stratified random sample of registered voters to form a deliberative panel, which hears from pro and con advocates and neutral experts while assessing the merits of a ballot measure. After four-to-five days of deliberation, each CIR writes an issue guide for voters that identifies key factual findings, along with the most important pro and con arguments. This study pools the results of survey experiments conducted on thirteen CIRs held from 2010 to 2018, resulting in a dataset that includes 67,120 knowledge scores collected from 10,872 registered voters exposed to 82 empirical claims. Analysis shows that reading the CIR guide had a positive effect on voters’ policy knowledge, with stronger effects for those holding greater faith in deliberation. We found little evidence of directional motivated reasoning but some evidence that reading the CIR statement can spark an accuracy motivation. Overall, the main results show how trust in peer deliberation provides one path out of the maze of misinformation shaping voter decisions during elections. © 2023 Gastil et al.

However, the distinction between active and passive use of social media, although important in explaining a variety of users’ behaviours, has been overlooked in terms of its potential to predict key socially relevant outcomes like beliefs in conspiracy theories. In three studies (N = 1388, in total), we provide evidence on (a) the role of passive social media use in believing in conspiracy theories via personal relative deprivation; (b) the interaction effect between social media use and personal relative deprivation on beliefs in conspiracy theories. The results showed that passive social media use is linked to, and increases, beliefs in conspiracy theories and this relationship is partially mediated via increased personal relative deprivation (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 3, personal relative deprivation was also manipulated experimentally in the context of a ʻmoderation-of-process' design, yielding a significant interaction with social media use. The results are discussed in the light of their social and media psychological contribution and implications in the digital era, when misinformation often becomes prevalent. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1017/S0007123422000631,conceptual replication of four key findings about factual corrections and misinformation during the 2020 us election: evidence from panel-survey experiments,"In the final two months of the 2020 US election, we conducted eight panel experiments to evaluate the immediate and medium-term effects of misinformation and factual corrections. Our results corroborate four sets of existing findings: fact-checks reliably improve factual accuracy, while misinformation degrades it; effects of fact-checks on belief accuracy endure, though they fade with time; effects on attitudes are minuscule; and there are important partisan asymmetries. We also offer one new empirical finding suggesting that effect heterogeneities by personality type and cognitive style may reflect attention paid to treatments. Our study confirms that the fundamental push and pull of misinformation and factual corrections on political beliefs holds even in electoral settings as saturated with mistruths as the 2020 US election.

10.1111/bjhp.12681,life beyond life: perceptions of post-mortem organ donation and consent to donate—a focus group study in italy,"Objectives: Many factors such as personal and cultural beliefs, misinformation, fear of death and inadequate will registering procedures can influence post-mortem organ donation. The present study aimed to explore the perceptions, beliefs and information around post-mortem donation and will expression in different groups of the Italian population, to orient future interventions and raise awareness. Design: Qualitative research with focus groups. Methods: A total of 38 focus groups involving 353 participants including the general population (young adults: 18–39, mature adults: 40–70), local and hospital health professionals, critical area health professionals (emergency room and intensive care), registry office employees and opinion leaders, were conducted in six regions from different parts of Italy between June and November 2021. Thematic analysis was conducted with the use of Atlas.ti9. Results: Five overarching themes were identified: dilemmas regarding donation, resistance to donation, facilitators of donation, difficulties in terms of will expression and proposals to encourage will expression. Possible facilitators were having personal and professional experiences with organ donation, feeling useful for society, having reliable information and trust in the health care system. Potential barriers to donation were doubts and fears about brain death, bodily integrity concerns, religious beliefs, misinformation and distrust in the health care system. Conclusions: These results highlighted the significance of a bottom-up perspective with regard to identifying the personal perceptions and beliefs with regard to donation, underlining the urgency of creating tailored interventions to sensitize different groups of the population in terms of promoting an informed choice and a culture of donation. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1002/acp.4103,weak correlations among 13 episodic memory tasks related to the same public event,"If an individual demonstrates accurate autobiographical memory in one task, will they also demonstrate accurate autobiographical memory in related tasks? Over 18 months, 213 participants completed 13 episodic memory tasks related to the same national referendum. Tasks included false memories for fake news, flashbulb memories, factual memories, memory for emotions, hindsight bias, eyewitness accuracy, susceptibility to leading questions and memory blindness. Although moderate to strong correlations were found over time for the same episodic memory tasks, correlations among differing memory tasks were very weak. Our findings suggest that individuals vary in how well they remember different elements of a public event. We conclude that episodic memory is a multi-faceted construct and researchers should be slow to generalise from one task to another, even when the two tasks refer to the same public event (e.g., we should not presume that individual differences in event memory will predict false memories for fake news). © 2023 The Authors.

10.1177/00936502231178432,short but critical?: how “fake news” and “anti-elitist” media attacks undermine perceived message credibility on social media,"Citizens increasingly turn to social media for information, where they often rely on cues to judge the credibility of news messages. In these environments, populist politicians use “fake news” and “anti-elitist” attacks to undermine the credibility of news messages. This article argues that to truly understand the impact of these criticism cues, one must simultaneously consider additional contextual cues as well as individual-level moderators. In a factorial survey, we exposed 715 respondents to tweets by a politician retweeting and discrediting a news message of which topic and source varied. We find that both the fake news cue and the anti-elitist cue have limited across-the-board effects but decrease credibility if the message is incongruent with voters’ issue positions. Our results thus offer a more optimistic view on the power of populist media criticism cues and suggest that source and confirmation heuristics are (still) stronger influences on citizens’ credibility evaluations. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Two GloVe variations (840B and 50) are debiased by identifying the gender direction in the word embedding space and then removing or reducing the gender component from the embeddings of target words, while preserving useful semantic information. Their gender bias is assessed through the Word Embedding Association Test. The performance of co-reference resolution and text classification models trained on both original and debiased embeddings is evaluated in terms of accuracy. A compressed co-reference resolution model is examined to gauge the effectiveness of debiasing techniques on resource-efficient models. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply compression techniques to debiased models. By analyzing the context preservation of debiased embeddings using a Twitter misinformation dataset, this study contributes valuable insights into the practical implications of debiasing methods for real-world applications such as person profiling. © 2023, The Author(s).",

10.1002/acp.4136,"to believe or not to believe: personality, cognitive, and emotional factors involving fake news perceived accuracy","What are the factors that influence individuals' belief in fake news? A structured survey was conducted to examine the impact of cognitive, emotional, and personality factors on the perceived accuracy of fake news. This study utilizes certain facets of the Personality Inventory of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (PID-5-Adult trait) to investigate the phenomenon of fake news. Using actual fake news headlines encountered on Facebook, the study revealed that individuals with high levels of psychoticism, impulsivity, suspiciousness, and low analytical reasoning abilities are more likely to believe fake news. Furthermore, the study found that fear induced by news content significantly influences by impeding rational, factual analysis. These findings suggest that while social media platforms contribute to the dissemination of fake news, individual vulnerabilities also play a crucial role. These findings could be useful for the development of digital literacy programs. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e20383,perception and deception: exploring individual responses to deepfakes across different modalities,"This study is one of the first to investigate the relationship between modalities and individuals' tendencies to believe and share different forms of deepfakes (also deep fakes). Using an online survey experiment conducted in the US, participants were randomly assigned to one of three disinformation conditions: video deepfakes, audio deepfakes, and cheap fakes to test the effect of single modality against multimodality and how it affects individuals’ perceived claim accuracy and sharing intentions. In addition, the impact of cognitive ability on perceived claim accuracy and sharing intentions between conditions are also examined. The results suggest that individuals are likelier to perceive video deepfakes as more accurate than cheap fakes, but not audio deepfakes. Yet, individuals are more likely to share video deepfakes than cheap and audio deepfakes. We also found that individuals with high cognitive ability are less likely to perceive deepfakes as accurate or share them across formats. The findings emphasize that deepfakes are not monolithic, and associated modalities should be considered when studying user engagement with deepfakes. © 2023 The Authors",
10.1007/s11229-023-04299-9,collective deception: toward a network model of epistemic responsibility,"What kind of collective is responsible for the deception that follows disinformation campaigns? Jennifer Lackey argues in The Epistemology of Groups that a group agent is responsible for such deception. She analyzes this deception as a group lie, which involves a group misrepresenting its own beliefs through a jointly accepted assertion or a spokesperson. Against this view, I argue that the group responsible for disinformation campaigns is a diffuse network. This deception involves misrepresenting scientific knowledge, not a group belief. Taking tobacco industry disinformation campaigns as an example, I argue that these corporate groups needed a network of epistemically authoritative sources—including scientists, doctors, and reputable publishers—to create and spread disinformation in order to make a skeptical view of scientific knowledge appear credible. As such, I argue that a network is epistemically responsible for this deception. First, I challenge the assumption within group epistemology that assertion is the basis of epistemic responsibility and argue that credibility enhancement is the basis instead. This explains how non-testimonial forms of support and corroboration from multiple sources can bolster the apparent credibility of an implausible view. Next, I describe the roles of different corroborators to show why it is necessary to include them. Finally, I defend a network model of epistemic responsibility for deception. Understanding how enhancing the credibility of disinformation is a matter of responsibility can help us to build more trustworthy communities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",
10.3758/s13423-023-02276-4,repetition could increase the perceived truth of conspiracy theories,"Conspiracy theories can be encountered repeatedly, which raises the issue of the effect of their repeated exposure on beliefs. Earlier studies found that repetition increases truth judgments of factual statements, whether they are uncertain, highly implausible, or fake news, for instance. Would this ""truth effect"" be observed with conspiracy statements? If so, is the effect size smaller than the typical truth effect, and is it associated with individual differences such as cognitive style and conspiracy mentality? In the present preregistered study, we addressed these three issues. We asked participants to provide binary truth judgments to conspiracy and factual statements already displayed in an exposure phase (an interest judgment task) or that were new (displayed only in the truth judgment task). We measured participants' cognitive style with the three-item Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and conspiracy mentality with the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ). Importantly, we found that repetition increased truth judgments of conspiracy theories, unmoderated by cognitive style and conspiracy mentality. Additionally, we found that the truth effect was smaller with conspiracy theories than with uncertain factual statements, and suggest explanations for this difference. The results suggest that repetition may be a simple way to increase belief in conspiracy theories. Whether repetition increases conspiracy beliefs in natural settings and how it contributes to conspiracism compared to other factors are important questions for future research. © 2023, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.34044/j.kjss.2023.44.4.32,when fake news comes with translation: a study of perception toward coronavirus-related news translation into thai,"This paper aims to investigate how coronavirus-related fake news as a result of translation is perceived in the Thai context. Using the framework of truth criteria to guide the online questionnaire and focus group, the researchers gathered the different perspectives of three age groups: Group 1 aged 19–38, Group 2 aged 39–54, and Group 3 aged 55 or above. The findings reveal that: (1) Group 3 agrees that translated news should be compatible with their existing, verified knowledge; (2) respondents in different age groups have significantly different opinions when assessing the coherence of news translations; (3) Group 1 is the most critical when looking for the credibility of news sources; (4) Group 1 is more likely than older groups to make time to verify translated news through social consensus; and (5) Group 1 is the most active in their search for supporting evidence. The decision to verify the news translation is influenced by time constraints, family relationships, technology, and the ease of information processing. This paper sheds light on the basic understanding of fake news from translation and its impact on interactions between news services and audiences of different cultures. © 2023 Kasetsart University.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0284107,exploring parents’ views of the use of narratives to promote childhood vaccination online,"Background Negative information about vaccines that spreads online may contribute to parents’ vaccine hesitancy or refusal. Studies have shown that false claims about vaccines that use emotive personal narratives are more likely to be shared and engaged with on social media than factual evidence-based public health messages. The aim of this study was to explore parents’ views regarding the use of positive narratives to promote childhood vaccination. Methods We identified three *4-minute video narratives from social media that counter frequent parental concerns about childhood vaccination: parents and informed decision-making (online misinformation about vaccines); a paediatrician’s clinical experience with vaccine-preventable diseases (prevention of still existing diseases); and a mother’s experience with vaccine-preventable disease (risks of the disease). Focus group discussions were held with parents of children aged 0 to 5 years to assess their views on these three narratives and their general opinion on the use of narratives as a vaccine promotion intervention. Results Four focus groups discussions were virtually held with 15 parents in December 2021. In general, parents trusted both health care provider’s and parent’s narratives, but participants identified more with stories having a parent as the main character. Both narratives featuring personal stories with vaccine-preventable diseases were preferred by parents, while the story about informed decision-making was perceived as less influential. Parents expressed the need for reliable and nuanced information about vaccines and diseases and felt that a short video format featuring a story was an efficient vaccine promotion intervention. However, many mentioned that they generally are not watching such videos while navigating the Web. Conclusion While vaccine-critical stories are widely shared online, evidence on how best public health could counter these messages remains scarce. The use of narratives to promote vaccination was well-perceived by parents. Future studies are needed to assess reach and impact of such an intervention. © 2023 Dubé et al.

10.1371/journal.pone.0287870,scientists' deficit perception of the public impedes their behavioral intentions to correct misinformation,"This paper investigates the relationship between scientists' communication experience and attitudes towards misinformation and their intention to correct misinformation. Specifically, the study focuses on two correction strategies: source-based correction and relational approaches. Source-based approaches combatting misinformation prioritize sharing accurate information from trustworthy sources to encourage audiences to trust reliable information over false information. On the other hand, relational approaches give priority to developing relationships or promoting dialogue as a means of addressing misinformation. In this study, we surveyed 416 scientists from U.S. land-grant universities using a self-report questionnaire. We find that scientists' engagement in science communication activities is positively related to their intention to correct misinformation using both strategies. Moreover, the scientists' attitude towards misinformation mediates the relationship between engagement in communication activities and intention to correct misinformation. The study also finds that the deficit model perception-that is, the assumption that scientists only need to transmit scientific knowledge to an ignorant public in order to increase understanding and support for science-moderates the indirect effect of engagement in science communication activities on behavioral intention to correct misinformation using relational strategies through attitude towards misinformation. Thus, the deficit model perception is a barrier to engaging in relational strategies to correct misinformation. We suggest that addressing the deficit model perception and providing science communication training that promotes inclusive worldviews and relational approaches would increase scientists' behavioral intentions to address misinformation. The study concludes that scientists should recognize their dual positionality as scientists and members of their community and engage in respectful conversations with community members about science. © 2023 Choi et al.

10.3390/philosophies8050078,is it virtuous to love truth and hate falsehood?,"There is a great deal of academic literature, much of it coming from the social sciences and from social epistemology, which presents itself as addressing a very general problem: the problem of excessive falsehood. Falsehood comes in two general forms: false statements and false beliefs. Of course, falsehood, in both these forms, has always been with us, but it is often supposed to be on the rise. I will argue that there is no new or growing problem of excessive falsehood (variously referred to as the problem of “misinformation” or “fake news”). Furthermore, we should reject the very idea that falsehood as such is a problem, and hence we should reject the idea of coming up with public policy responses to this so-called problem. I argue that the idea that falsehood is a problem is a natural consequence of the idea that it is virtuous to love truth and hate falsehood. I argue that, although there are several virtues related to truth (such as the intellectual virtue of curiosity and the moral virtue of honesty), a love of truth and hatred of falsehood are not themselves virtues. © 2023 by the author.",
10.1038/s41562-023-01644-3,a taxonomy of anti-vaccination arguments from a systematic literature review and text modelling,"The proliferation of anti-vaccination arguments is a threat to the success of many immunization programmes. Effective rebuttal of contrarian arguments requires an approach that goes beyond addressing flaws in the arguments, by also considering the attitude roots—that is, the underlying psychological attributes driving a person’s belief—of opposition to vaccines. Here, through a pre-registered systematic literature review of 152 scientific articles and thematic analysis of anti-vaccination arguments, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy that relates common arguments and themes to 11 attitude roots that explain why an individual might express opposition to vaccination. We further validated our taxonomy on coronavirus disease 2019 anti-vaccination misinformation, through a combination of human coding and machine learning using natural language processing algorithms. Overall, the taxonomy serves as a theoretical framework to link expressed opposition of vaccines to their underlying psychological processes. This enables future work to develop targeted rebuttals and other interventions that address the underlying motives of anti-vaccination arguments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",

However, there is still a need to understand the mechanisms that cause misinformation propagation on social media. In addition, evidence from non-Western societies remains rare. This study reports on survey evidence from eight countries to examine whether social media fatigue can influence users to believe misinformation, influencing their sharing intentions. Our insights also build on prior cognitive and personality literature by exploring how this mechanism is conditional upon users’ cognitive ability and narcissism traits. The results suggest that social media fatigue can influence false beliefs of misinformation which translates into sharing on social media. We also find that those with high levels of cognitive ability are less likely to believe and share misinformation. However, those with low cognitive ability and high levels of narcissism are most likely to share misinformation on social media due to social media fatigue. This study is one of the first to provide cross-national comparative evidence highlighting the adverse effects of social media fatigue on misinformation propagation and establishing that the relationship is not universal but dependent on both cognitive and dark personality traits of individuals. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",
10.21833/ijaas.2023.08.021,exploring the impact of trust dimensions on covid-19 vaccination intention and behavior: a quantitative analysis,"The rapid proliferation of COVID-19 vaccines has emerged as a pivotal strategy to combat the ongoing pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy, influenced by various vaccine-related factors, significantly impacts the adoption of COVID-19 vaccination. Misinformation contributes to vaccine distrust and hinders individuals' willingness to receive the vaccine. Despite its critical importance, there remains a paucity of comprehensive studies focusing on the determinants of vaccine confidence, leading to a deficiency in implementation research aimed at understanding and modifying individuals' behavior towards COVID-19 vaccination. This research endeavors to examine the influence of three key dimensions of trust in the COVID-19 vaccine, namely vaccine reliability, transparency in information dissemination, and pharmaceutical laboratory investment in innovation, on individuals' intention to receive the vaccine. Furthermore, we investigate the repercussions of these dimensions on actual COVID-19 vaccination behavior. Our quantitative study comprises a sample of 240 participants and employs a rigorous analytical approach. The findings underscore that individuals' intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 is positively affected by all three trust dimensions, i.e., drug reliability, innovation investment, and information transparency. Importantly, this intention positively correlates with actual vaccination behavior. This study substantiates the utility of the behavioral approach and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in elucidating vaccine hesitancy and the factors exerting influence on vaccine uptake. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1145/3583780.3614936,interpretable fake news detection with graph evidence,"Automatic detection of fake news has received widespread attentions over recent years. A pile of efforts has been put forward to address the problem with high accuracy, while most of them lack convincing explanations, making it difficult to curb the continued spread of false news in real-life cases. Although some models leverage external resources to provide preliminary interpretability, such external signals are not always available. To fill in this gap, in this work, we put forward an interpretable fake news detection model IKA by making use of the historical evidence in the form of graphs. Specifically, we establish both positive and negative evidence graphs by collecting the signals from the historical news, i.e., training data. Then, given a piece of news to be detected, in addition to the common features used for detecting false news, we compare the news and evidence graphs to generate both the matching vector and the related graph evidence for explaining the prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both Chinese and English datasets. The experiment results show that the detection accuracy of IKA exceeds the state-of-the-art approaches and IKA can provide useful explanations for the prediction results. Besides, IKA is general and can be applied on other models to improve their interpretability. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.",

10.1038/s41598-023-34629-3,deep fake detection and classification using error-level analysis and deep learning,"Due to the wide availability of easy-to-access content on social media, along with the advanced tools and inexpensive computing infrastructure, has made it very easy for people to produce deep fakes that can cause to spread disinformation and hoaxes. This rapid advancement can cause panic and chaos as anyone can easily create propaganda using these technologies. Hence, a robust system to differentiate between real and fake content has become crucial in this age of social media. This paper proposes an automated method to classify deep fake images by employing Deep Learning and Machine Learning based methodologies. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based systems employing handcrafted feature extraction fail to capture more complex patterns that are poorly understood or easily represented using simple features. These systems cannot generalize well to unseen data. Moreover, these systems are sensitive to noise or variations in the data, which can reduce their performance. Hence, these problems can limit their usefulness in real-world applications where the data constantly evolves. The proposed framework initially performs an Error Level Analysis of the image to determine if the image has been modified. This image is then supplied to Convolutional Neural Networks for deep feature extraction. The resultant feature vectors are then classified via Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors by performing hyper-parameter optimization. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy of 89.5% via Residual Network and K-Nearest Neighbor. The results prove the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique; hence, it can be used to detect deep fake images and reduce the potential threat of slander and propaganda. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1007/s11229-023-04336-7,fake news and epistemic flooding,"The advance of the internet and social media has had a drastic impact on our epistemic environment. This paper will focus on two different risks epistemic agents face online: being exposed to fake news and epistemic flooding. While the first risk is widely known and has been extensively discussed in the philosophical literature, the notion of ‘epistemic flooding’ is a novel concept introduced in this paper. Epistemic flooding occurs when epistemic agents find themselves in epistemic environments in which they are routinely confronted with more information and evidence than they can diligently process. Epistemic flooding is one of the most significant risks epistemic agents run while using social media and one of the reasons why the first risk (being exposed to fake news) is especially pernicious. It is particularly harmful if one ascribes to the Spinozan model of belief acquisition in which belief comes easy. Mitigating the combined threat of fake news and epistemic flooding requires us to think normatively about our epistemic environments and how to better them. This paper turns to the normative framework of epistemic environmentalism in order to accomplish this. © 2023, The Author(s).",

In this study, we experimentally test how debunking text structure (truth sandwich vs. bottom-heavy) and headline format (statement vs. questions) affect the belief in misinformation across topics of the safety of COVID vaccines and GMO foods. Design: Experimental online study. Methods: A representative German sample of 4906 participants were randomly assigned to reading one of eight debunking messages in the experimentally varied formats and subsequently rated the acceptance of this message and the agreement to misinformation statements about the mentioned topics and an unrefuted control myth. Results: While the debunking messages specifically decreased the belief in the targeted myth, these beliefs and the acceptance of the debunking message were unaffected by the text structures and headline formats. Yet, they were less successful when addressing individuals with strong pre-existing, incongruent attitudes and distrust in science. Conclusions: The risk of backfire effects in debunking misinformation is low. Text structure and headline format are of relatively little importance for the effectiveness of debunking messages. Instead, writers may need to pay attention to the text being comprehensive, trustworthy and persuasive to maximize effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors.

10.1371/journal.pone.0287298,fake news stance detection using selective features and fakenet,"The proliferation of fake news has severe effects on society and individuals on multiple fronts. With fast-paced online content generation, has come the challenging problem of fake news content. Consequently, automated systems to make a timely judgment of fake news have become the need of the hour. The performance of such systems heavily relies on feature engineering and requires an appropriate feature set to increase performance and robustness. In this context, this study employs two methods for reducing the number of feature dimensions including Chi-square and principal component analysis (PCA). These methods are employed with a hybrid neural network architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model called FakeNET. The use of PCA and Chi-square aims at utilizing appropriate feature vectors for better performance and lower computational complexity. A multi-class dataset is used comprising ‘agree’, ‘disagree’, ‘discuss’, and ‘unrelated’ classes obtained from the Fake News Challenges (FNC) website. Further contextual features for identifying bogus news are obtained through PCA and Chi-Square, which are given nonlinear characteristics. The purpose of this study is to locate the article’s perspective concerning the headline. The proposed approach yields gains of 0.04 in accuracy and 0.20 in the F1 score, respectively. As per the experimental results, PCA achieves a higher accuracy of 0.978 than both Chi-square and state-of-the-art approaches. Copyright: © 2023 Aljrees et al.

10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122640,concept-drift detection index based on fuzzy formal concept analysis for fake news classifiers,"Unpredictable changes in the underlying distribution of the streaming data over time are known as concept drift. The development of procedures and techniques for drift detection, interpretation, and adaptation is central to concept-drift research. Data research has demonstrated that machine learning in a concept-drift environment produces poor learning results if drift is not handled. This study focuses on defining the concept-drift detection index to predict when the performance of a machine learning model for text-stream classifiers is low. It proposes an index that relies on the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis theory. The index exploits the formal lattice to understand whether new incoming facts (e.g., news) are well represented in the training data used to build the machine-learning model. Fake news was deemed ideal for testing this new measure because its typical application scenario required handling a stream of unstructured content and concept-drift awareness. Experiments on three news datasets revealed a relevant correlation (i.e., 73.9 %, 80.8 %, and 81 %) between the Accuracy of Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Passive Aggressive (PA) models, respectively, and the proposed index. This strong correlation suggests that the new index can avoid incorrect classifications and help in retraining decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

However, it is difficult for human beings to judge an article's truthfulness manually, which is why This paper mainly wanted to cure the effect and to found out an automated fake news detection system with benchmark accuracy by using a machine learning classifier, which must be higher than other recent research works. In essence, this work’s target is to find out an efficient way to detect fake and real news, and it also the target is to compare with existing work where researchers used machine learning classifiers and deep learning architecture. The proposed approach depended on a systematic literature review and a publicly available dataset where 7796 news data are recorded with 50% real and 50% fake news. The best and benchmark accuracy is 93.61%, achieved by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) among the used Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistics Regression classifiers, and the achieved accuracy is better than the exciting recent research works. Moreover, fake news is detected, people are able to differentiate between fake or real news, and effects are cured when people used SVM. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.",
10.1038/s41598-023-37072-6,predictors and motives for mask-wearing behavior and vaccination intention,"Containing a pandemic requires that individuals adhere to measures such as wearing face-masks and getting vaccinated. Therefore, identifying predictors and motives for both behaviors is of importance. Here, we study the decisions made by a cross-national sample in randomized hypothetical scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that mask-wearing was predicted by empathic tendencies, germ aversion, and higher age, whilst belief in misinformation and presentation of an interaction partner as a family member lowered the safety standards. The main motives associated with taking the mask off included: rationalization, facilitating interaction, and comfort. Vaccination intention was positively predicted by empathy, and negatively predicted by belief in misinformation and higher costs of the vaccine. We found no effect of immunization status of the surrounding social group. The most common motive for vaccination was protection of oneself and others, whereas undecided and anti-vaccine groups reported doubts about the effectiveness and fear of side effects. Together, we identify social and psychological predictors and motives of mask-wearing behavior and vaccination intention. The results highlight the importance of social context for mask-wearing, easy access to vaccines, empathy, and trust in publicly distributed information. © 2023, The Author(s).",

Using the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, this study examined the influence of vaccine misinformation exposure and information overload on cognitive and affective responses as well as vaccine information avoidance behaviors. Findings showed that misinformation exposure predicted cognitive health beliefs (perceived vaccination barriers and benefits) and negative emotions (fear) toward the vaccines; health beliefs in turn predicted information avoidance. Information overload moderated (a) the relationship between misinformation exposure and health beliefs and (b) the relation between misinformation exposure and fear. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Data were collected from 84 WIEIAD videos across 59 YouTube accounts. Our discourse analysis demonstrated that misinformation is presented in ways that invoke expertise, scientific credibility and personal experience, making it more difficult to identify and respond to. Our analysis illustrates how misinformation arises in seemingly mundane sites of discourse and argues that identifying and responding to misinformation is not a binary task. The WIEIAD genre demonstrates the complexity of contemporary wellness discourses and their broader role in health and risk management, which results in the (re)circulation of misinformation. The tension between the sensory and the rational in WIEIAD videos highlights the complexities present in how misinformation, wellness and health are entangled on social media. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1057/s41284-022-00347-0,countering fake information as a guarantee of state information security,"The article focuses on the notion of fake information as a tool of psychological influence in the context of hybrid wars. Works of the prominent academicians in the area of manipulation studies constitute the theoretical framework of this research. Empirical research methods such as observation, comparison, generalization and expert evaluation are used. First of all, types and methods of psychological influences used by mass media and social networks with a view to manipulate public opinions are distinguished. Moreover, the impact of emotions on the critical perception of the news is highlighted. The indicators of manipulative influence are defined in order to resist them. Besides, the ways of creating and distributing false information are described. In addition, the development of fakes identification mechanisms is considered a priority for the governmental and other public institutions. This is illustrated by a range of technologies developed to automatically detect fake news. Apart from that, the degrees of the information reliability are explored. Furthermore, structural elements of fake messages, which include the source and the message itself, are discussed. Misinformation of the public, promotion of certain opinions, encouragement of aggressive actions and instalment of doubts are singled out as the main tasks of fake information. Additionally, stages of countering fakes are distinguished. Finally, the specific features of the forensic expertise procedure are determined in order to provide information security in Ukraine. The research demonstrates the importance of an efficient security system, which would identify fake information and limit its propagation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1038/s41598-023-39807-x,the relation between authoritarian leadership and belief in fake news,"Individual factors such as cognitive capacities matter when one is requested to spot fake news. We suggest, however, that social influence—specifically as exercised by an authoritarian leader—might matter more if one is expected to agree with the fake news. We developed a single-item prototype measure of leadership styles and recruited participants from four Western democratic countries (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, N = 501) who identified their immediate boss as an autonomous, paternalistic, or authoritarian leader. Then they were asked to evaluate the accuracy of several fake news articles and their expectations to agree with their boss when asked about these articles. People with authoritarian bosses were less accurate in spotting fake news (Cohen’s d = 0.32) compared to employees with autonomous bosses. The bigger effect, however, was that they would agree with their boss about the fake news article when it was shared by their authoritarian boss compared to employees with autonomous (Cohen’s d = 1.30) or paternalistic bosses (Cohen’s d = 0.70). We argue that in addition to effects on the perceived accuracy of information, social influence, conformity, and obedience are crucial and unacknowledged factors of how misinformation may be maintained and propagated by authoritarian leaders. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1098/rsos.221036,the role of perceived minority-group status in the conspiracy beliefs of factual majority groups,"Research suggests that minority-group members sometimes are more susceptible to misinformation. Two complementary studies examined the influence of perceived minority status on susceptibility to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs. In study 1 (n = 2140), the perception of belonging to a minority group, rather than factually belonging to it, was most consistently related with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation across national samples from the USA, the UK, Germany and Poland. Specifically, perceiving that one belongs to a gender minority group particularly predicted susceptibility to misinformation when participants factually did not belong to it. In pre-registered study 2 (n = 1823), an experiment aiming to manipulate the minority perceptions of men failed to influence conspiracy beliefs in the predicted direction. However, pre-registered correlational analyses showed that men who view themselves as a gender minority were more prone to gender conspiracy beliefs and exhibited a heightened conspiracy mentality. This effect was correlationally mediated by increased feelings of system identity threat, collective narcissism, group relative deprivation and actively open-minded thinking. Especially, the perception of being a minority in terms of power and influence (as compared to numerically) was linked to these outcomes. We discuss limitations and practical implications for countering misinformation. © 2023 The Authors.",
10.1038/s41598-023-40716-2,tokenization of social media engagements increases the sharing of false (and other) news but penalization moderates it,"Some major social media companies are announcing plans to tokenize user engagements, derived from blockchain-based decentralized social media. This would bring financial and reputational incentives for engagement, which might lead users to post more objectionable content. Previous research showed that financial or reputational incentives for accuracy decrease the willingness to share misinformation. However, it is unclear to what extent such outcome would change if engagements instead of accuracy were incentivized, which is a more realistic scenario. To address this question, we conducted a survey experiment to examine the effects of hypothetical token incentives. We find that a simple nudge about the possibility of earning token-based points for the achieved user engagements increases the willingness to share different kinds of news, including misinformation. The presence of penalties for objectionable posts diminishes the positive effect of tokenization rewards on misinformation sharing, but it does not eliminate it. These results have policy implications for content moderation practices if platforms embrace decentralization and engagement tokenization. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad246,covid-19 and social media: beyond polarization,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought upon a massive wave of disinformation, exacerbating polarization in the increasingly divided landscape of online discourse. In this context, popular social media users play a major role, as they have the ability to broadcast messages to large audiences and influence public opinion. In this article, we make use of openly available data to study the behavior of popular users discussing the pandemic on Twitter. We tackle the issue from a network perspective, considering users as nodes and following relationships as directed edges. The resulting network structure is modeled by embedding the actors in a latent social space, where users closer to one another have a higher probability of following each other. The results suggest the existence of two distinct communities, which can be interpreted as “generally pro” and “generally against” vaccine mandates, corroborating existing evidence on the pervasiveness of echo chambers on the platform. By focusing on a number of notable users, such as politicians, activists, and news outlets, we further show that the two groups are not entirely homogeneous, and that not just the two poles are represented. To the contrary, the latent space captures an entire spectrum of beliefs between the two extremes, demonstrating that polarization, while present, is not the only driver of the network, and that more moderate, “central” users are key players in the discussion. © The Author(s) 2023.

10.1007/s11098-023-02031-4,too humble for words,"It’s widely held that a lack of intellectual humility is part of the reason why flagrantly unjustified beliefs proliferate. In this paper, I argue that an excess of humility also plays a role in allowing for the spread of misinformation. Citing experimental evidence, I show that inducing intellectual humility causes people inappropriately to lower their confidence in beliefs that are actually justified for them. In these cases, they manifest epistemic humility in ways that make them epistemically worse off. I argue that epistemic humility may fail to promote better beliefs because it functions for us against the background of our individualistic theory of responsible epistemic agency: until we reject such theories, intellectual humility is as much a problem as a solution to epistemic ills. Virtue epistemology is inadequate as a response to unjustified beliefs if it does not look beyond the virtues to our background beliefs. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1007/s10639-023-11730-8,development and validation of a scale for assessing university students' new online media and reporting literacy,"New media literacy is an expected competency for university students. However, few literacy scales can evaluate students' fake news reporting and checking abilities. In the past, the new media literacy framework only included Critical Consuming, Critical Prosumption, Functional Prosumption, and Functional Consuming. Therefore, this study proposes a self-assessable new online media and reporting literacy scale (NOMRL) based on the previous new media literacy framework. The NOMRL scale was developed in four phases. A literature review generated a pool of items in the first phase. Phase 2 was conducted through an expert review to confirm the validity of the content. Phase 3 was the purification of the scale in Study 1, where 243 university students participated in this survey phase. Finally, we analyzed 365 university students' responses in Study 2 and derived a factor structure using EFA while conducting a reliability assessment with CFA to test the theoretical structure. This study resulted in a 22-item scale, including two new constructs: Behavioral Consumption and Behavioral Prosumption. The scale can help college students self-assess their level of reporting-related literacy in social media. In addition to discussing the educational implications, this paper provides insights and suggestions for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
10.1111/spc3.12815,"“they'll take a gun to me before i get that shot”: rationalization, emotions, and misinformation in covid-19 vaccine hesitancy","Vaccine hesitancy—the reluctance, delay, or refusal to vaccinate regardless of availability—is not a new concept in psychology, medicine, or public health. However, given the emotions surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine, hesitancy has proven difficult to overcome. To-date, the bulk of available data on vaccine hesitancy are quantitative, leaving room for exploratory investigations into the reasons adults remain unvaccinated. This qualitative study assessed the motivations, beliefs, and perceptions of individuals who have decided to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19. We had one exploratory research question: What social psychological justifications emerge from vaccine hesitant people's explanations of their decisions to remain unvaccinated? To assess this question, we conducted 18 interviews with unvaccinated adults throughout 2021–2022. The interviews consisted of 20 questions regarding participants' perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and their intentions to get vaccinated. Thematic analysis revealed four main themes in the answers provided by participants: rationalization; identity, beliefs and potential modifiers; emotional responses; and information sources. These results offer insight for future vaccination efforts. © 2023 The Authors. Social and Personality Psychology Compass published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1177/23727322231219684,using behavioral science for infodemic preparedness: the case of vaccination misinformation,"Health authorities aim to address misinformation within the framework of pandemic preparedness. Research reviewed here helps to contain vaccination misinformation: detect relevant parameters for an effective response, reduce individuals’ belief, and prevent its spread. The reviewed measures range from text-based campaign materials to real-time rebuttals of science deniers to empathy-based corrections in physician-patient conversations. The measures require knowledge of either the content of misinformation, the misleading tactics used by science deniers, or the psychological profiles of the recipients. Moreover, these measures require expertise from behavioral scientists and training for spokespersons and opinion leaders. Thus, policymakers can maintain an infrastructure for social listening, engage behavioral scientists in pandemic preparedness, and strengthen spokespersons and health care personnel before the next pandemic starts. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Without the time to teach information literacy (IL) skills, we created a series of information sourcing (IS) prompts that were small and flexible enough to be deployed anywhere we might need IL reinforcement. We describe this “IS plug-in,” share challenges surrounding its creation and successful implementation across multiple courses, and explain its grounding in information literacy theory. We then provide insights and recommendations for future management education research that arose from experiences with the unique IS plug-in approach and in-depth application of new research in IL. We provide recommendations for expanding the IL Framework’s use and measurement, and improving our understanding of authority and information versus belief. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.1098/rsos.221097,correcting covid-19 vaccine misinformation in 10 countries,"What can be done to reduce misperceptions about COVID-19 vaccines? We present results from experiments conducted simultaneously on YouGov samples in 10 countries (N = 10 600), which reveal that factual corrections consistently reduce false beliefs about vaccines. With results from these 10 countries, we find that exposure to corrections increases belief accuracy by 0.16 on a 4-point scale, while exposure to misinformation decreases belief accuracy by 0.09 on the same scale. We are unable to find evidence that either misinformation or factual corrections affect intent to vaccinate or vaccine attitudes. Our findings on effect duration are less conclusive; when we recontacted participants two weeks later, we observed 39% of the initial accuracy increase, yet this result narrowly misses conventional thresholds of statistical significance (p = 0.06). Taken together, our results illustrate both the possibilities and limitations of factual corrections. Evidence from 10 highly diverse populations shows that exposure to factual information reduces belief in falsehoods about vaccines, but has minimal influence on subsequent behaviours and attitudes. © 2023 The Authors.",
10.22550/REP81-2-2023-04,adolescents’ vulnerability to disinformation: its measurement and relationship to critical thinking and moral disengagement; [la vulnerabilidad de los adolescentes frente a la desinformación: su medición y su relación con el pensamiento crítico y la desconexión moral],"Young adolescents are more vulnerable to disinformation owing to the time that they spend online and their content consumption habits. The consequences of this phenomenon can be serious, both for the individual and at a social and political level. To alleviate this situation, different agencies recommend healthy practices regarding consumption and exchange of information; from checklists to self-learning exercises for the development of critical thinking. This research proposes a tool for the identification of behaviours among adolescents when giving credibility to information or content and the motives that lead them to share it, contributing at times to the spread of misleading information. After an exhaustive process of design, piloting, and psychometric validation using an English-speaking sample (N = 417), a reliable instrument was obtained. We also measured its correlation with critical thinking and moral disengagement. The results lead us to conclude that this is a new tool with which to observe the information consumption behaviours of young people and thus measure their vulnerability to disinformation. Similarly, we have confirmed how greater critical thinking is positively re-lated to more responsible consumption when giving credibility to content or news, and how moral disengagement is linked to the fact of sharing such items with greater ease. © 2023, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

10.3758/s13421-022-01351-w,text validation: overlooking consistency effect discrepancies,"The consistency effect, prevalent in the text comprehension literature, comprises longer reading times for inconsistent than equivalent consistent text continuations. It is widely interpreted as reflecting readers' effective ""validation"" of text coherence. However, there are also numerous phenomena of readers' deficient validation, sometimes collectively labelled ""misinformation effects."" This study asked whether readers become consciously aware of the text discrepancies diagnosed by the consistency effect. Experiment 1 scrutinized (a) conspicuous conceptual inconsistencies and (b) character-trait inconsistencies. It replicated the consistency effect both at a critical target sentence and at a subsequent sentence (spillover). Experiment 2 replaced self-paced reading with consistency judgments about the target sentences. The subjects overlooked almost half of the inconsistencies, thus denying that readers reliably become aware of consistency-effect discrepancies. In Experiment 3, the former target sentences were reframed as explicit questions. Accuracy for inconsistencies was statistically indistinguishable from accuracy for consistent targets, favoring the interpretation that Experiment 2 subjects overlooked known, encoded discrepancies. The results are interpreted with reference to Kintsch's (Psychological Review, 95, 163-182, Kintsch, 1988; Comprehension. New York: Cambridge University Press, Kintsch, 1998) construction-integration model, a refinement of which adds an immediate, passive stage of validation processing to construction and integration. It is proposed that passive validation affords the detection of text inconsistencies that do not reach the level of readers' conscious awareness. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1037/law0000401,the impact of viewing social media images on eyewitness identification,"After observing a crime, eyewitnesses may conduct their own investigation on social media to search for the perpetrator. In two experiments, participants viewed an image of an innocent suspect in the time between viewing a mock-crime video and completing a lineup procedure. The imagewas presented in the context of a social media search or a police mugbook viewing. A control group viewed no photos of innocent people before the lineup. The same images were used in the mugbook and social media conditions, but the social media profiles were designed so that the innocent suspect stood out as the only person who had mutual friends with the participant. In both experiments, the innocent suspect was more likely to be mistakenly identified if they were previously viewed on social media relative to the control condition. The mugshot viewing also increased innocent suspect identifications, but only after the plausibility of the innocent suspect was increased in Experiment 2. Relative to the control condition, participants who viewed either a mugbook or socialmedia had lower accuracy when they identified the suspect with high confidence. These findings indicate that viewing images of innocent people can contaminate the memory of eyewitnesses, influence identifications at a subsequent lineup procedure, and undermine the eyewitness confidence–accuracy relation. © 2023 American Psychological Association",

10.11645/17.1.3360,sharing in the echo chamber: examining instagram users’ engagement with infographics through the frame of digital literacy,"Social media platforms have had a tangible effect on how users share information and their digital literacy skills. Infographics are often shared on Instagram, but they harbour the potential for misinformation. Users do not always research posts before sharing, and the social nature of the site influences user behaviour. Current digital literacy theories highlight the need to integrate digital technologies into traditional information literacy theories, because technologies are increasingly central to everyday life and information consumption. In this article, I investigated digital literacy from a user perspective, examining how users’ digital literacy skills interact with their sharing of infographics. I also examined how infographics are used for activism, and the social and visual affordances of Instagram, which helped to dictate the users’ relationship with digital literacy. I conducted a qualitative study consisting of interviews with six participants. Participants were asked about their Instagram behaviour, infographic selection, and how they judge the reliability of an infographic before sharing. Participant responses were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Responses revealed that users are familiar with traditional concepts of information literacy, such as referencing sources, but often prioritise other areas, such as the social and personal contexts of an infographic when deciding what to share. Users also dialogue with online followers using visual imagery and activism. These sharing practices are contextualised within Instagram affordances and the behaviours the platform enables and constrains. The study is novel in examining digital literacy as enacted through Instagram, specifically the use of infographics, while also foregrounding the user perspective. The results emphasise the need to consider user perspectives in digital literacy whether conducting research or teaching. © 2023, CILIP Information Literacy Group. All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s10919-022-00419-0,the gestural misinformation effect in child interviews in switzerland,"Gestures embody concepts in the form of universal representations. Researchers have highlighted that social communication often embodies nonverbal behavior. A forensic interviewer’s nonverbal behavior, such as gesturing during an interview, could communicate misleading information and may cause inaccuracies in the interviewees’ testimonies. The current study was conducted in Switzerland and included 108 child participants, in three age groups (a younger sample aged 6–9 years, n = 32) (a middle sample aged 10–11 years, n = 40) and an older sample aged 12–13 years, n = 36). Participants viewed a video and completed an interview about the video, individually, immediately after. During the questioning, the interviewer deliberately misled the interviewees with nonverbal gestures. The results showed that 95 children were misled by at least one gesture and that gestures led to a significant decrease in accuracy. Children also incorporated misleading gestures and reported false information; adding to existing evidence that misinformation can also be communicated through nonverbal gestures. Our findings demonstrate the negative influence of misleading gestures in child eyewitness interviews and provide more evidence for the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect, reported in previous research. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1037/xge0001395,gamified inoculation interventions do not improve discrimination between true and fake news: reanalyzing existing research with receiver operating characteristic analysis,"Gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve the detection of online misinformation are becoming increasingly prevalent. Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre–post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond “true” or “fake”) from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment).We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more “false” responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection. © 2023 American Psychological Association",

Methodology: This paper analyses the journalistic sources-from the indicators of number, identification and typology-used in 420 articles on the coverage of COVID-19 corresponding to four journalistic professional models: traditional press, digital native media, popular press and verification platforms. Results: The analysis reflects an adequate management of sources by the Spanish press during the coverage of the pandemic, mostly using a higher than standard number of sources; identifying them correctly in almost all cases; and using an adequate variety. Therefore, despite the clear predominance of official sources, there is also a notable presence of expert sources from the scientific and health fields. Discussion and conclusions: The quality of source management has contributed to fighting disinformation in the Spanish press, although there are important differences between professional models. Verification platforms are those with the highest quality standards when managing their information sources, which helps to reinforce key criteria in the fight against disinformation, such as verification, relevance, credibility and transparency. © 2023, University of La Laguna.

10.1017/XPS.2023.1,do survey questions spread conspiracy beliefs?,"Conspiracy theories and misinformation have become increasingly prominent in politics, and these beliefs have pernicious effects on political behavior. A prominent line of research suggests that these beliefs are promoted by repeated exposure. Yet, as scholars have rushed to understand these beliefs, they have exposed countless respondents to conspiratorial claims, raising the question of whether researchers are contributing to their spread. We investigate this possibility using a pre-registered within-subjects experiment embedded in a panel survey. The results suggest that exposure to a standard conspiracy question causes a significant increase in the likelihood of endorsing that conspiracy a week later. However, this exposure effect does not occur with a question format that offers an alternative, non-conspiratorial explanation for the target event. Thus, we recommend that researchers reduce the likelihood of spreading conspiracy beliefs by adopting a question format that asks respondents to choose between alternative explanations for an event.  © The Author(s), 2023.

10.1371/journal.pone.0282308,information battleground: conflict perceptions motivate the belief in and sharing of misinformation about the adversary,"Misinformation has emerged as a major societal concern. But why do citizens contribute to the dissemination of falsehoods online? This article investigates this question by focusing on the role of motivated reasoning and, in particular, perceptions of group-based conflict. It examines the effect of perceived conflict on the endorsement of false news in the context of a regional conflict between Russia and the West as experienced by Ukrainian citizens. In our survey experiment, a sample of Ukrainians (N = 1,615) was randomly assigned to read negative false news stories about Russia, the European Union or Tanzania–a country with no stakes in the conflict. The results show that higher perceived conflict between Ukraine and Russia makes Ukrainians less likely to endorse false news targeting the European Union, but more likely to endorse false news that paint a negative picture of Russia. This finding extends the support for motivated reasoning theory beyond Western contexts investigated so far. Importantly, the effects of conflict perceptions remain strong after controlling for group identity and political knowledge of participants. These results advance our understanding of why false information is disseminated and point to the importance of conflict deescalation to prevent the diffusion of falsehoods. © 2023 Mazepus et al.

While most complied with these measures, a vocal minority protested against them. Early reports emphasized the unusual heterogeneity of these protests: Hippies and esoterics marched alongside conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazis. We examined what these protestors might (andmight not) have in common. A large study with antilockdown protestors in Germany (N = 1,700) revealed four subgroups: centrists, politically undifferentiated, left-wingers, and right-wingers. Beyond that, these subgroups demonstrated striking similarities: All endorsed conspiracy beliefs, misinformation, esotericism, and vaccine hesitancy to a similar extent.

10.1037/dec0000223,numeracy does not polarize climate change judgments: numerate people are more knowledgeable and knowledge is power,"Statistical numeracy skills have been found to be among the most robust general predictors of risk understanding and decision-making quality. However, some research suggests that when numerate people hold extreme worldviews they could use their skills to engage in motivated (biased) reasoning about controversial topics like climate change, further polarizing their judgments and beliefs. While suggestive, previous numeracy studies on this topic have neglected the highly influential role of knowledge in skilled judgment and decision making (see Skilled Decision Theory; Cokely et al., 2018). To address this limit, we conducted two studies with diverse (n = 537) and probabilistically representative samples (n = 305) of U.S. residents, testing the first integrated cognitive model of the relations between numeracy, worldviews, knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions. Structural modeling revealed that regardless of people’s worldviews, numeracy was not associated with polarization or enhanced bias. However, numeracy was consistently related to more accurate climate change knowledge, which was by far the strongest predictor of accurate beliefs (e.g., 6–10 times stronger than people’s worldviews), largely mediating the associations between worldviews and risk perceptions (e.g., individualists were less informed and less concerned about climate change). Consistent with the risk literacy Knowledge is Power account, results suggest that when accurate risk knowledge is available numeracy skills may generally promote more informed and therefore less biased judgment and decision making, even when people are confronted with controversies and conflicts of interest. © 2023 American Psychological Association",
10.1177/10755470231186396,polarization or mainstreaming? how covid-19 news exposure affects perceived seriousness of the pandemic and the susceptibility to covid-19 misinformation?,"Two surveys investigated whether the exposure to COVID-19 news widens (polarization) or narrows (mainstreaming) the partisan gap in perceived seriousness of the pandemic, and how the perception affects individuals’ susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation that either exaggerates or downplays its health risks. Overall exposure to COVID-19 news homogenized the partisans’ otherwise divergent risk perceptions, but the partisan divide was wider among those selectively approaching like-minded news outlets. Perceived seriousness of COVID-19 subsequently altered participants’ susceptibility to either fear-arousing or fear-suppressing COVID-19 misinformation in a belief-confirming manner. It is discussed how news media shape the public’s reality perception amid the global crisis. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.3390/socsci12030137,"covid-19 pandemic and the crisis of care: wellness discourses, neoliberal self-care, and (dis)infodemic","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an influx of misinformation surrounding the virus and its origins. This paper examines the negative consequences of neoliberal self-care discourses related to COVID-19 that contributed to the disinfodemic, focusing on the wellness industry. Some health gurus and wellness instructors promoted lifestyle adjustments and self-care to prevent contracting the virus and sometimes blamed COVID-19 patients for contracting it. These claims contributed to vaccine hesitancy and pseudo-scientific beliefs. The misinformation was attractive partly because it promised individual control and independence from mainstream (scientific) advice. These discourses existed before the pandemic but were amplified within the wellness community after the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper concludes by exploring the feminist notions of care and solidarity as a counter to the neoliberal notion of self-care. © 2023 by the author.",
10.1002/sce.21790,science education in an age of misinformation,"In this paper, we argue that the current science curricula are failing to educate students to be competent outsiders to science. Historically, science education has rested on two premises. The first is that it is possible for students to acquire sufficient scientific knowledge from K-12 education to become intellectually independent. That is that science education can produce individuals capable of evaluating scientific evidence and arguments critically for themselves. This belief is what underlies many of the conceptions of scientific literacy and is the basis of the rationale that is used to sustain and justify what is offered in nearly all countries across the globe. The second is the belief that the science that students will encounter will have been filtered such that it can be trusted. Nothing today could be further from the truth. Today, misinformation abounds and much of it purports to be scientific. Very few conceptions of scientific literacy have considered how students can be prepared to evaluate the claims that abound on social media. Current conceptions of “scientific literacy,” we argue, are failing to articulate the competencies and knowledge required in today's changed context. In what follows, we lay out our arguments for why it is time to rethink the conception of scientific literacy by considering what it requires to be a competent outsider to science. Then drawing on our recent report, we lay out what might be done within science education to address the specific phenomenon of misinformation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",
10.1016/j.datak.2023.102176,leveraging relevant summarized information and multi-layer classification to generalize the detection of misleading headlines,"Disinformation is an important problem facing society nowadays. Given the rapid and easy access to information, news stories quickly go viral, the vast majority of which are misleading and with no prospect of verification. Specifically, the headline of a correctly designed news item must correspond to a summary of the main information of that news item and it should be neutral. However, many headlines circulating on the Internet use false or distorted information, seeking to confuse or mislead the reader. Misleading headlines indicate a dissonance between the headline and the content of the news story. From a computational perspective, this problem is being tackled as a Stance Detection problem between the headline and the body text of the news item. This paper contributes to the fight against the spread of misleading information by presenting a generic and flexible multi-level hierarchical classification. The approach is based on two stages that enable the detection of the stance between the news headline and the body text. The proposed architecture, called HeadlineStanceChecker+ uses the headline and only the essential information of the news item (not the full body text) as inputs. To extract this essential information, different summarization approaches (extractive and abstractive) are analyzed in order to determine the most relevant information for the task. The experimentation has been carried out using the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) dataset. A 94.49% accuracy was obtained using extractive summaries, which were more helpful than abstractive ones. HeadlineStanceChecker+ improves the accuracy results of existing state-of-the-art systems. In conclusion, using automatic extractive summaries together with the two-stage generic architecture is an effective solution to the problem. © 2023 The Author(s)",
10.1371/journal.pone.0283238,learning about informal fallacies and the detection of fake news: an experimental intervention,"The philosophical concept of informal fallacies–arguments that fail to provide sufficient support for a claim–is introduced and connected to the topic of fake news detection. We assumed that the ability to identify informal fallacies can be trained and that this ability enables individuals to better distinguish between fake news and real news. We tested these assumptions in a two-group between-participants experiment (N = 116). The two groups participated in a 30-minute-long text-based learning intervention: either about informal fallacies or about fake news. Learning about informal fallacies enhanced participants’ ability to identify fallacious arguments one week later. Furthermore, the ability to identify fallacious arguments was associated with a better discernment between real news and fake news. Participants in the informal fallacy intervention group and the fake news intervention group performed equally well on the news discernment task. The contribution of (identifying) informal fallacies for research and practice is discussed. Copyright: © 2023 Hruschka, Appel.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115863,promoting covid-19 vaccine confidence through public responses to misinformation: the joint influence of message source and message content,"Objective: During the pandemic healthcare professionals and political leaders routinely used traditional and new media outlets to publicly respond to COVID-19 myths and inaccuracies. We examine how variations in the sources and messaging strategies of these public statements affect respondents’ beliefs about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We analyzed the results of an experiment embedded within a multi-wave survey deployed to US and UK respondents in January–February 2022 to examine these effects. We employ a test-retest between-subjects experimental protocol with a control group. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions reflecting discrete pairings of message source (political authorities vs. healthcare professionals) and messaging strategy (debunking misinformation vs. discrediting mis-informants) or a control condition. We use linear regression to compare the effects of exposure to treatment conditions on changes in respondent beliefs about the potential risks associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Results: In the UK sample, we observe a statistically significant decrease in beliefs about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines among respondents exposed to debunking messages by healthcare professionals. We observe a similar relationship in the US sample, but the effect was weaker and not significant. Identical messages from political authorities had no effect on respondents’ beliefs about vaccine risks in either sample. Discrediting messages critical of mis-informants likewise had no influence on respondent beliefs, regardless of the actor to which they were attributed. Political ideology moderated the influence of debunking statements by healthcare professionals on respondent vaccine attitudes in the US sample, such that the treatment was more effective among liberals and moderates than among conservatives. Conclusions: Brief exposure to public statements refuting anti-vaccine misinformation can help promote vaccine confidence among some populations. The results underscore the joint importance of message source and messaging strategy in determining the effectiveness of responses to misinformation. © 2023 The Authors",
10.1007/s11406-022-00608-7,the unique depictive damage of gombrichian schemata in cartoons,"According to Ernst Gombrich, cartoons provide us the chance to “study the use of symbols in a circumscribed context [and] find out what role the image may play in the household of our mind” (Gombrich 1973, 190). This paper looks at some underexplored implications and outcomes of Ernst Gombrich’s conceptual schemata when such a schemata is applied to cartoons. While we might easily avoid defamatory reference when picking out a subject in writing or speech, cartoon depictions, especially those unaccompanied by speech bubbles or captions, often rely on a visual symbolism typified by the warping of some features the removal of others, and the manifestation of some visual trope or other, more easily lend themselves to defamatory reference. While harms to the referent are many in cases of defamatory cartoons, this paper focuses on the harms to the viewers of such cartoons by the depicter’s message and mode of representation, unique to the cartoon form. I will focus on the harms of misinformation of the viewer by the visual schemata (Gombrich 1960) present in certain cartoons, and the way this misinformative visual schemata (Ibid) may also restrict the possibility of conceptual revisions in its viewership. Harms of this kind come out uniquely in cartoons via norms of cartooning (as a particularly stylized and symbolic mode of visual representation) and the norms of interaction employed in the act of viewing a cartoon. As we’ll see in our case study of the infamous Jyllands Posten cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet, even in cases where a cartoon representation bears no visual similarity to its referent, viewers can easily and reliably pick out the referent by calling to mind, in our focal case, the defamatory stereotypes, stock figures and icons inextricably linked with the referent. I argue that the damage to viewers of these sorts of depictions lies not in the fact that the viewer manages to pick out the intended referent of the depiction but what tools they use to pick out the referent and how such tools of reference (mis)inform their understanding of the referent they’ve picked out. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",
10.1037/mac0000149,"evaluating tweets reduces the influence of inaccurate content, but does “liking” a tweet reflect evaluation?","Evaluative mindsets can reduce the influence of inaccurate information on subsequent judgments. But while people regularly self-report accuracy as crucial for their information-seeking activities and reputations, contemporary discussions of social media experiences suggest such considerations are not guaranteed. We examined whether evaluative benefits emerge for information embedded in social media posts, and whether decisions central to social media experiences can reflect evaluative considerations. In two experiments, participants read Tweets containing potentially inaccurate information, afterward answering questions related to the Tweet contents. Experiment 1 replicated the previous findings: Incorrect responses were more likely after reading inaccurate than accurate or filler Tweets. In Experiment 2, judging Tweets for accuracy reduced participants’ reproductions of inaccurate ideas as compared to judging Tweets for interest or for whether one would “like” the contents. Self-report data indicated participants who identified accuracy as important while reading Tweets showed benefits even when not explicitly tasked with making accuracy assessments. © 2023 American Psychological Association.

10.1037/xap0000458,effects of inductive learning and gamification on news veracity discernment,"This preregistered study tests a novel psychological intervention to improve news veracity discernment. The main intervention involved inductive learning (IL) training (i.e., practice discriminating between multiple true and fake news exemplars with feedback) with or without gamification. Participants (N = 282 Prolific users) were randomly assigned to either a gamified IL intervention, a nongamified version of the same IL intervention, a no-treatment control group, or a Bad News intervention, a notable web-based game designed to tackle online misinformation. Following the intervention (if applicable), all participants rated the veracity of a novel set of news headlines. We hypothesized that the gamified intervention would be the most effective for improving news veracity discernment, followed by its nongamified equivalent, then Bad News, and finally the control group. The results were analyzed with receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses, which have previously never been applied to news veracity discernment. The analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between conditions and the Bayes factor indicated very strong evidence for the null. This finding raises questions about the effectiveness of current psychological interventions and contradicts prior research that has supported the efficacy of Bad News. Age, gender, and political leaning all predicted news veracity discernment. © 2023 American Psychological Association",
10.1016/j.actpsy.2023.103930,is the covid-19 bad news game good news? testing whether creating and disseminating fake news about vaccines in a computer game reduces people's belief in anti-vaccine arguments,"Improving vaccination eagerness is crucial, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and establishing new procedures to achieve that goal is highly important. Previous research (Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019a, 2019b) has indicated that playing the “Bad News” game, in which a player spreads fake news to gain followers, reduces people's belief in fake news. The goal of the present paper was to test an analogous new game called “COVID-19 Bad News (CBN)” to improve one's eagerness to vaccinate against coronavirus. CBN was constructed to examine whether creating and disseminating fake news focused on vaccinations and the COVID-19 pandemic has a similar effect and improves people's attitudes toward vaccination. Two experiments were conducted where participants played CBN or Tetris and afterwards evaluated the credibility of statements about vaccines against COVID-19 and finally filled out a questionnaire concerning their attitudes toward vaccination. The results show that playing CBN does not reduce evaluations of the credibility of all statements that are unfavorable to vaccines (false as well as true). Additionally, it does not enhance readiness to vaccinate. Future research and limitations are discussed. © 2023",
10.1371/journal.pone.0282202,effective mitigation of the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation: awareness training and counter-speech,"The spread and influence of misinformation have become a matter of concern in society as misinformation can negatively impact individuals’ beliefs, opinions and, consequently, decisions. Research has shown that individuals persevere in their biased beliefs and opinions even after the retraction of misinformation. This phenomenon is known as the belief perseverance bias. However, research on mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation has been limited. Only a few debiasing techniques with limited practical applicability have been proposed, and research on comparing various techniques in terms of their effectiveness has been scarce. This paper contributes to research on mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation by proposing counter-speech and awareness-training techniques and comparing them in terms of effectiveness to the existing counter-explanation technique in an experiment with N = 251 participants. To determine changes in opinions, the extent of the belief perseverance bias and the effectiveness of the debiasing techniques in mitigating the belief perseverance bias, we measure participants’ opinions four times in the experiment by using Likert items and phi-coefficient measures. The effectiveness of the debiasing techniques is assessed by measuring the difference between the baseline opinions before exposure to misinformation and the opinions after exposure to a debiasing technique. Further, we discuss the efforts of the providers and recipients of debiasing and the practical applicability of the debiasing techniques. The CS technique, with a very large effect size, is the most effective among the three techniques. The CE and AT techniques, with medium effect sizes, are close to being equivalent in terms of their effectiveness. The CS and AT techniques are associated with less cognitive and time effort of the recipients of debiasing than the CE technique, while the AT and CE techniques require less effort from the providers of debiasing than the CS technique. © 2023 Siebert, Siebert.

10.1086/724220,the credibility effect: defamation law and audiences,"What should be the legal response to false statements? In the context of defamation law, courts try to set a standard that balances the interests of speakers and their potential targets. This article empirically demonstrates an unappreciated effect of such decisions on third parties: a credibility effect. Using a series of lab experiments, I find that defamation law makes individuals more trusting of reports from various media. This credibility effect is desirable when the report is true but can lead to unintended consequences in the case of misinformation. In particular, the credibility effect is shown to cast a stigma on innocent targets who choose not to file lawsuits. The existence of the credibility effect calls for different balances than are currently employed in defamation law; challenges the vindication justification; and, more broadly, illustrates the limits of policies intended to fight misinformation. © 2023 by The University of Chicago.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0281777,moral leniency towards belief-consistent disinformation may help explain its spread on social media,"The spread of false and misleading information on social media is largely dependent on human action. Understanding the factors that lead social media users to amplify (or indeed intervene in) the spread of this content is an ongoing challenge. Prior research suggests that users are not only more likely to interact with misinformation that supports their ideology or their political beliefs, they may also feel it is more acceptable to spread. However, less is known about the influence of newer, issue-specific beliefs. Two online studies explored the relationship between the degree of belief-consistency of disinformation on users’ moral judgements and intentions to spread disinformation further. Four disinformation narratives were presented: disinformation that supported or undermined the UK Government’s handling of COVID-19, and disinformation that minimised or maximised the perceived risk of COVID-19. A novel scale for measuring intentions to contribute to the spread of social media content was also used in study 2. Participants reported greater likelihood of spreading false material that was consistent with their beliefs. More lenient moral judgements related to the degree of belief-consistency with disinformation, even when participants were aware the material was false or misleading. These moral judgements partially mediated the relationship between belief-consistency of content and intentions to spread it further on social media. While people are concerned about the spread of disinformation generally, they may evaluate belief-consistent disinformation differently from others in a way that permits them to spread it further. As social media platforms prioritise the ordering of feeds based on personal relevance, there is a risk that users could be being presented with disinformation that they are more tolerant of. © 2023 Joyner et al.

10.3390/jintelligence11020027,actively open-minded thinking and its measurement,"Actively open-minded thinking (AOT) is measured by items that tap the willingness to consider alternative opinions, sensitivity to evidence contradictory to current beliefs, the willingness to postpone closure, and reflective thought. AOT scales are strong predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps such as superstitious thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. Nevertheless, AOT is most commonly measured with questionnaires rather than performance indicators. Questionnaire contamination becomes even more of a danger as the AOT concept is expanded into new areas such as the study of fake news, misinformation, ideology, and civic attitudes. We review our 25-year history of studying the AOT concept and developing our own AOT scale. We present a 13-item scale that both is brief and accommodates many previous criticisms and refinements. We include a discussion of why AOT scales are such good predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks. We conclude that it is because such scales tap important processes of cognitive decoupling and decontextualization that modernity increasingly requires. We conclude by discussing the paradox that although AOT scales are potent predictors of performance on most rational thinking tasks, they do not predict the avoidance of myside thinking, even though it is virtually the quintessence of the AOT concept. © 2023 by the authors.",

Can interventions such as fact checks stem the tide of the “infodemic” within marginalized communities? We explore the sudden flood of misinformation and disinformation targeting Latinos during the 2020 election and global COVID-19 pandemic to answer these questions. In a preregistered experiment, we find that exposure to misinformation can decrease factual accuracy, and neither trust in nor consumption of media, including ethnic media, serves as a buffer against these misinformation effects. However, fact checks eliminate the effects of misinformation on false beliefs without “backfiring” and reducing accuracy. Fact checks improve factual accuracy among subgroups varying in levels of political knowledge, trust, and acculturation. These findings provide crucial support for recent investments into fact checking by Latino-oriented media outlets and address gaps within the literature over whether such interventions are also effective within marginalized groups. © 2023 Southern Political Science Association.

Research has overwhelmingly focused on individual cognitive measures of HIV stigma (e.g., internalized, anticipated, and experienced). However, little research explores the interactions and societal structures through which HIV stigma is produced. Data from qualitative interviews with 30 black gay and bisexual men living with HIV in the U.S. Deep South revealed an interconnected and interdependent set of processes that produce and reproduce HIV stigma. These included social interactions (silence, euphemism, and gossip), witnessed acts of marginalization, word-of-mouth transmission of HIV misinformation, and laws and policies carried out within the education and criminal justice systems. Efforts to reduce stigma that focus on individual beliefs and attitudes are critical to improving the well-being of PLWH. However, reducing HIV stigma requires intervening on the social interactions and structures through which HIV stigma is produced and reproduced. © The Author(s) 2022.",

10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad078,moralization and extremism robustly amplify myside sharing,"We explored whether moralization and attitude extremity may amplify a preference to share politically congruent (""myside"") partisan news and what types of targeted interventions may reduce this tendency. Across 12 online experiments (N = 6,989), we examined decisions to share news touching on the divisive issues of gun control, abortion, gender and racial equality, and immigration. Myside sharing was systematically observed and was consistently amplified when participants (i) moralized and (ii) were attitudinally extreme on the issue. The amplification of myside sharing by moralization also frequently occurred above and beyond that of attitude extremity. These effects generalized to both true and fake partisan news. We then examined a number of interventions meant to curb myside sharing by manipulating (i) the audience to which people imagined sharing partisan news (political friends vs. foes), (ii) the anonymity of the account used (anonymous vs. personal), (iii) a message warning against the myside bias, and (iv) a message warning against the reputational costs of sharing ""mysided""fake news coupled with an interactive rating task. While some of those manipulations slightly decreased sharing in general and/or the size of myside sharing, the amplification of myside sharing by moral attitudes was consistently robust to these interventions. Our findings regarding the robust exaggeration of selective communication by morality and extremism offer important insights into belief polarization and the spread of partisan and false information online. © 2023 The Author(s).",
10.1016/j.actpsy.2023.103945,trust in science and belief in misinformation mediate the effects of political orientation on vaccine hesitancy and intention to be vaccinated,"In previous studies, anti-vaccination attitudes have been attributed either to far-right voters or to both far-left and far-right voters. The present study investigated the associations of political orientation with vaccine hesitancy and intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and the potential mediating roles of trust in science and belief in misinformation. A total of 750 Italian respondents completed an online questionnaire in the period between the second and the third wave of COVID-19 (from 9th March to 9th May 2021). The results showed that political orientation had both direct and indirect associations with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine intention, mediated by trust in science and belief in misinformation. Specifically, right-wing adherents were less trustful of scientists and believed in COVID-19-related misinformation more than left-wing adherents, and these two factors accounted for their higher vaccine hesitancy and reduced willingness to receive an anti-COVID-19 vaccination. Our findings are in line with the predictions of the mindsponge theory and suggest that communicative campaigns aimed at improving the rates of vaccine acceptance in right-wing adherents should be specifically focused on enhancing trust in science and reducing belief in misinformation. © 2023 The Authors",

We analyze a survey experiment that employed three different advertisements that directly addressed “fake news.” We find that all advertisements were effective at increasing skepticism towards “fake news” headlines. We also find no evidence of backfire effects occurring. However, subsequent analysis using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) finds significant heterogeneity within these treatment effects. While all advertisements were effective, each ad was effective in different ways despite common themes and content. This suggests a more complicated understanding of the counter-disinformation process and highlights BART’s utility in public opinion research. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1515/mmcks-2023-0009,exposure of valenced fake news frames to country brand equity and the role of news credibility in this process,"The stronger capacity of falsehood to diffuse in comparison with the truth pushes researchers to identify fake news effects on the formation of country brand equity due to the distant and intangible nature of this notion. To explore this exposure, valenced framing theory is applied as a suitable framework where credibility and cognitive image are checked to be mediators in this relationship. This study adopted a perceived and projected image approach for online survey design, and a quantitative method was applied. The results depict that fake news frames have an indirect effect on a country's brand equity mediated by news credibility and cognitive image toward the country. We show that news credibility and cognitive image function as sequential mediators, meaning that the level of believability and cognitive preconceptions about a certain country directly affect country brand equity. Moreover, this study demonstrates that negatively framed fake news can affect all dimensions of country brand equity negatively, whereas positive fake news frames do not change people's perceptions significantly. According to the outcomes, we proved that the level of credibility is significantly influenced by the type of valenced fake news frame as well. We discuss the implications of the findings and future research directions in the field of fake news and country brands. © 2023 Olga V. Novoselova et al.",

This study examined the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by race and ethnicity, particularly among African American and Latinx communities in Eastern Pennsylvania (PA). Methods Survey data was collected in July 2021 in Philadelphia, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton, PA. The 203 participants (38.7% Black, 27.5% Latinx) completed the 28-question survey of COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in either English or Spanish. Result Out of the 203 participants, 181 participants met all the inclusion criteria, including completed surveys; of these participants, over three-fifths (63.5%) were acceptant of the COVID-19 vaccine whereas the remainder (36.5%) were hesitant. Binary logistic regression results showed that age, concern for vaccine efficacy, race, knowledge on the vaccine, and belief that the COVID-19 virus is serious significantly influenced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Minorities were more likely to be hesitant toward vaccination (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8) than non-Hispanic whites. Those who believed the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective (OR: 8.3, 95% CI: 3.8, 18.2), and that the virus is not serious (OR: 8.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 61.8) showed the greatest odds of hesitancy. Conclusions Minority status, age less than 45 years, misinformation about seriousness of COVID-19 illness, and concern about vaccine efficacy were contributing factors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, understanding and addressing the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in minority groups is essential to decreasing transmission and controlling this pandemic, and will provide lessons on how to implement public health measures in future pandemics.  © 2023 Colvin et al.

10.4324/9781003391616-12,japan’s changing approach to dealing with rumors in the aftermath of natural disasters and war,"Over the past 100 years, there have been many human-induced events, such as spreading disaster rumors (false rumors) and panics following natural disasters or Word War II in Japan. This chapter clarifies how the Japanese government (including local governments) from the Taisho era (1910s-1920s) to recent years have attempted to respond to man-made crises involving phenomena such as disinformation, rumors, and panics that tend to be triggered after natural disasters or war and consider the challenges that have existed in each period. The cases discussed in this chapter are the Great Kanto, Hanshin-Awaji, and East Japan earthquakes, several typhoons and earthquakes, and war disasters (air raids in Japan during World War II). Results of the analysis, this chapter concludes that although there will inevitably be information gaps to some extent at the time of a disaster, overcoming these gaps always involves a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It will be increasingly important for governments to be aware of these issues and to consider recovery methods. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Yasuhiro Takeda, Jun Ito, Yusuke Kawashima; individual chapters, the contributors.",
10.22572/mi.29.1.2,media discourse on web portals and twitter – an online battleground for the combat between media literacy and fake news?; [novinarski diskurs na portalima i twitteru - medijski poligon borbe medijske pismenosti i lažnih vijesti?],"Mainstream media often simply download information posted on social media from unreliable sources without critical thinking and verifying the content. Nowadays, the accuracy of information in all types of media is less important than the number of clicks and views per media content. Due to the fact that there is a proven correlation between the level of media literacy and democratic development of a society, as well as the fact that the media have a great influence on the shaping of public opin-ion via media framing and agendas, this paper explores the awareness on media literacy of Twitter users in Croatia (primarily journalists) and their perception of their own consumption and dissemination of fake news across social networks and traditional mass media. Although Twitter is not popular in Croatia, it is intensively used by Croatian journalists, and tweets often serve as topics for media processing, which gives Twitter great importance in creating the Croatian media discourse. The research was conducted by encouraging a discussion and undertaking further content analysis of tweets regarding the role of media literacy in combating the impact of fake news, especially on social networks. This was followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with six journalists who are active Twitter users and content analysis of articles on media literacy and fake news available on Croatian web portals. Triangulation was used in order to reduce the echo chamber effect on the results of the study. The research has shown that respondents, i.e. Twitter users in Croatia – including journalists – are not sufficiently informed about media literacy and its impact on combating fake news. It has also pinpointed their lack of awareness regarding their own consumption and dissemination of fake news across social networks and mass media. The objective of the research was to create a model for analyzing the interrelationship between media literacy and creating fake news from two perspectives: (1) evaluating self-perception of Twitter users via content analysis and in-depth interviews, and (2) analyzing media publications on the topic of media literacy and fake news, whose content reflects the perception of the media on these topics. © 2023, Doron Fakultet Politickih Znanosti.

10.1371/journal.pone.0284773,"experiences of women in prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum care during the covid-19 pandemic in selected cities in brazil: the resignification of the experience of pregnancy and giving birth","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted public and private health systems around the world, impairing good practices in women’s health care. However, little is known about the experiences, knowledge, and feelings of Brazilian women in this period. The objective was to analyze the experiences of women, seen at maternity hospitals accredited by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS, acronym in Portuguese), regarding health care during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum periods, their interpersonal relationships, and perceptions and feelings about the pandemic. This was a qualitative, exploratory research, carried out in three Brazilian municipalities with women hospitalized in 2020, during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum period, with COVID-19 or not. For data collection, semi-structured individual interviews (in person, by telephone, or by digital platform) were conducted, recorded and transcribed. The content analysis of thematic modalities was displayed as per the following axes: i) Knowledge about the disease; ii) Search for health care in prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum periods; iii) Experience of suffering from COVID-19; iv) Income and work; and v) Family dynamics and social support network. A total of 46 women were interviewed in São Luís-MA, Pelotas-RS, and Niterói-RJ. Use of media was important to convey information and fight fake news. The pandemic negatively impacted access to health care in the prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum periods, contributing to worsening of the population’s social and economic vulnerabilities. Women experienced diverse manifestations of the disease, and psychic disorders were very frequent. Social isolation during the pandemic disrupted the support network of these women, who found social support strategies in communication technologies. Women-centered care–including qualified listening and mental health support–can reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases in pregnant, parturient, and postpartum women. Sustainable employment and income maintenance policies are essential to mitigate social vulnerabilities and reduce risks for these women. © 2023 Lamy et al.

An online experiment was performed with 344 adults in the United States. The results showed that rebuttals by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rather than those by social media users, indirectly increased people’s willingness to receive the vaccine by reducing their psychological reactance to persuasive messages and their belief in the misinformation contained in the comments. Rebuttals by social media users became more effective in reducing reactance when people initially had stronger pro-vaccination attitudes. © 2022 AEJMC.",
10.1093/jcmc/zmad021,facts are hard to come by: discerning and sharing factual information on social media,"How credulous are we when engaging information on social media? Addressing this question, this article aims to understand how individuals' epistemic vigilance, a set of cognitive mechanisms that comprise our system of precaution in social interactions, may operate and fall short. Reporting findings from two survey experiments (Study 1, N = 413; Study 2, N = 392), we show that participants tended to be skeptical toward social media news, were reasonably successful in identifying true news, and reported a tendency to share true rather than false news. In one study, social endorsement enticed a higher accuracy rating of news posts. In both studies, people judged attitudinally congruent news posts as being more accurate and reported a higher likelihood to share them. Individuals' propensity to reflective thinking measured by cognitive reflection test potentially operated as a restraint on sharing inaccurate information and bolstered veracity anchoring in their information engagement. © 2023 The Author(s).",
10.1126/sciadv.abo6169,the social media context interferes with truth discernment,"There is widespread concern about misinformation circulating on social media. In particular, many argue that the context of social media itself may make people susceptible to the influence of false claims. Here, we test that claim by asking whether simply considering sharing news on social media reduces the extent to which people discriminate truth from falsehood when judging accuracy. In a large online experiment examining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and political news (N = 3157 Americans), we find support for this possibility. When judging the accuracy of headlines, participants were worse at discerning truth from falsehood if they both evaluated accuracy and indicated their sharing intentions, compared to just evaluating accuracy. These results suggest that people may be particularly vulnerable to believing false claims on social media, given that sharing is a core element of what makes social media “social.” Copyright © 2023 The Authors, some rights reserved;",

Using the development of the EU's governance approach to online service providers and platforms, this Article demonstrates how ordoliberalism as a set of beliefs regarding the regulation of market activity through law have shaped the understanding of appropriate measures for combating hybrid threats such as disinformation. Highlighting the origins of the E-Commerce Directive and the influence of ordoliberalism in the application of a regulated self-regulation model, the Article explores how ordoliberal philosophical ideas have influenced programme and policy level ideas concerning EU cyberspace governance as it relates to online platform activities. Even where there has been discursive change regarding the role of online platforms in contributing to an environment of insecurity, there has nevertheless been ideational continuity in the approach to their regulation, dictating the legal response in the Digital Services Act.  © The Author(s), 2023.

10.47305/JLIA2391035s,rethinking strategic autonomy in times of next generation eu: new digital agenda,"The digital transformation of the global economy and society has accelerated after the Covid-19 pandemic. The European Union (EU), compared to China and the United States, is losing its capacity for innovation and control over data and fundamental raw materials and could even lose ground in the regulatory power it has in the digital realm. This paper pays special attention to the situation and progress toward a new European policy to achieve digital strategic autonomy. It also briefly outlines the Recovery Plan for Europe as a possible incentive for its promotion. Both descriptive and analytical methods were employed to gather the data from secondary sources and provide reliable research results. The major findings of this article are that strategic autonomy is an imperative requirement for sustaining and encouraging European integration, forcing the EU to advance faster toward developing critical digital technologies. There is also an urgent need to secure critical parts of supply chains and data protection, intellectual property, and defense against disinformation. Finally, the European Union must improve its resilience to face new crises and lead the digitalization of its economy. © 2023 The authors.",
10.4324/9781003429036-13,covid: the invisible invasion,"There were more dreams of foreboding and then in January there were indications of a sinister new virus. The death toll rose quickly and people were afraid to meet, touch, and talk to others. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, was initially optimistic but then almost died from Covid after being put on a ventilator. Dreamers were increasingly vulnerable and exposed, as if in unchartered territory. Empathy disappeared in the face of vulnerability; people increasingly used the meetings as a therapeutic space. Social dreaming was a bulwark to social isolation and anxiety. Dreams revealed a cynical attitude to politicians who were felt to be disingenuous and self-seeking. Fake news, Dominic Cummings, Brexit, and Michelle Mone were amongst the dream associations here. As lockdown eased in 2020, there were morbid dreams with associations to psychopathic murderers and war criminals (Fred West, Eichmann) and references to Albert Camus and Macbeth. When a new strain of the virus appeared, dreams became horrific. It was as if we had lost something that we would never get back (The Uncanny). © 2024 John Clare and Ali Zarbafi.",
10.1007/s41979-022-00082-6,assessing confidence and certainty of students in an undergraduate linear algebra course,"Knowledge assessments in undergraduate STEM education commonly evaluate response correctness to determine learner proficiency. However, simultaneous evaluation of learner metacognition more accurately assesses the multiple dimensions of knowledge and has been shown to increase assessment validity and reliability. Motivation for researching these multidimensional methods has primarily been to identify guesswork and misinformation by evaluating the alignment of response correctness with the learner’s certainty that their provided response is correct. Learner confidence before assessment, however, has not been thoroughly investigated either alone or in conjunction with certainty for use in performance evaluation, especially at the undergraduate level. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy for assessing pre-assessment confidence and post-response certainty in relation to response correctness for students in an undergraduate linear algebra course. Due to the subjective nature of self-reflection, certainty was found to be more aligned with correctness than confidence. Though confidence and certainty levels were reported with similar overall averages, 32% of students demonstrated misaligned confidence and certainty. This study demonstrates the usefulness of a novel assessment method and presents insights that may inform teaching methods, improve examination structure, and identify concerning student behaviors early for corrective intervention. © 2022, The Author(s).",
10.1177/01461672221077519,how attitudes impact the continued influence effect of misinformation: the mediating role of discomfort,"Past research suggests that people continue believing retracted misinformation more when it is consistent versus inconsistent with their attitudes. However, the psychological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains unclear. We predicted that retractions of attitude-consistent misinformation produce greater feelings of discomfort than retractions of attitude-inconsistent misinformation and that this discomfort predicts continued belief in and use of the misinformation. We report combined analyses across 10 studies testing these predictions. Seven studies (total N = 1,323) used a mediational framework and found that the more consistent misinformation was with participants’ attitudes, the more discomfort was elicited by a retraction of the misinformation. Greater discomfort then predicted greater continued belief in the misinformation, which, in turn, predicted greater use of the misinformation when participants made relevant inferences. Three additional studies (total N = 574) utilized misattribution paradigms to demonstrate that the relation between discomfort and belief in misinformation is causal in nature. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",

To reduce perceived credibility and respondents’ attitudes toward the misinformation, peer corrections were more effective than algorithmic corrections for misinformation from a source with lower credibility; for misinformation from a highly credible source, the superiority effect of peer corrections was still significant on perceived credibility but not on respondents’ attitudes toward the misinformation. For the fact-checking tendency, we did not find a robust effect about how different features of corrective messages interacted.

10.1111/jssr.12836,"christ, country, and conspiracies? christian nationalism, biblical literalism, and belief in conspiracy theories","When misinformation is rampant, “fake news” is rising, and conspiracy theories are widespread, social scientists have a vested interest in understanding who is most susceptible to these false narratives and why. Recent research suggests Christians are especially susceptible to belief in conspiracy theories in the United States, but scholars have yet to ascertain the role of religiopolitical identities and epistomological approaches, specifically Christian nationalism and biblical literalism, in generalized conspiracy thinking. Because Christian nationalists sense that the nation is under cultural threat and biblical literalism provides an alternative (often anti-elite) source of information, we predict that both will amplify conspiracy thinking. We find that Christian nationalism and biblical literalism independently predict conspiracy thinking, but that the effect of Christian nationalism increases with literalism. Our results point to the contingent effects of Christian nationalism and the need for the religious variables in understanding conspiracy thinking. © 2023 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.",

We tested the potential effectiveness of social “truth queries”—user replies that drawattention to truth—as a novel intervention for reducing the impact of false information shared on social media. Participants were shown Tweets containing false information that appeared with user replies containing truth queries (Experiments 1–3), no replies (Experiments 1–3), or user replies unrelated to truth (Experiments 2 and 3) and asked to judge either the truth of the information contained in the Tweet or their likelihood of sharing it. We consistently found that social truth queries reduce belief in and reported intent to share Tweets containing false information compared to no replies or replies unrelated to truth.

10.3145/epi.2023.may.22,"fighting disinformation with artificial intelligence: fundamentals, advances and challenges; [inteligencia artificial contra la desinformación: fundamentos, avances y retos]","Internet and social media have revolutionised the way news is distributed and consumed. However, the constant flow of massive amounts of content has made it difficult to discern between truth and falsehood, especially in online platforms plagued with malicious actors who create and spread harmful stories. Debunking disinformation is costly, which has put artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine learning (ML) in the spotlight as a solution to this problem. This work revises recent literature on AI and ML techniques to combat disinformation, ranging from automatic classification to feature extraction, as well as their role in creating realistic synthetic content. We conclude that ML advances have been mainly focused on automatic classification and scarcely adopted outside research labs due to their dependence on limited-scope datasets.

An important research goal is to understand how misinformation spreads in order to curb it. Here, we test whether and how a single repetition of misinformation fuels its spread. Over two experiments (N = 260) participants indicated which statements they would like to share with other participants on social media. Half of the statements were repeated and half were new. The results reveal that participants were more likely to share statements they had previously been exposed to. Importantly, the relationship between repetition and sharing was mediated by perceived accuracy. That is, repetition of misinformation biased people's judgment of accuracy and as a result fuelled the spread of misinformation. The effect was observed in the domain of health (Exp 1) and general knowledge (Exp 2), suggesting it is not tied to a specific domain. © 2023",
10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad094,the spot the troll quiz game increases accuracy in discerning between real and inauthentic social media accounts,"The proliferation of political mis/disinformation on social media has led many scholars to embrace ""inoculation""techniques, where individuals are trained to identify the signs of low-veracity information prior to exposure. Coordinated information operations frequently spread mis/disinformation through inauthentic or ""troll""accounts that appear to be trustworthy members to the targeted polity, as in Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. We experimentally tested the efficacy of inoculation against inauthentic online actors, using the Spot the Troll Quiz, a free, online educational tool that teaches how to spot markers of inauthenticity. Inoculation works in this setting. Across an online US nationally representative sample (N = 2,847), which also oversampled older adults, we find that taking the Spot the Troll Quiz (vs. playing a simple game) significantly increases participants' accuracy in identifying trolls among a set of Twitter accounts that are novel to participants. This inoculation also reduces participants' self-efficacy in identifying inauthentic accounts and reduced the perceived reliability of fake news headlines, although it had no effect on affective polarization. And while accuracy in the novel troll-spotting task is negatively associated with age and Republican party identification, the Quiz is equally effective on older adults and Republicans as it was on younger adults and Democrats. In the field, a convenience set of Twitter users who posted their Spot the Troll Quiz results in the fall of 2020 (N = 505) reduced their rate of retweeting in the period after the Quiz, with no impact on original tweeting. © 2023 The Author(s).",
10.1371/journal.pone.0276238,the impact of vaccine information and other factors on covid-19 vaccine acceptance in the thai population,"Increased misinformation circulating among the population during the COVID-10 pandemic can trigger rejection to take up vaccines. This study assesses the influence of vaccine information and other factors on vaccine acceptance in the Thai population. Between March and August 2021, six rounds of cross-sectional surveys through village health volunteer networks and online channels were conducted; as well as qualitative interviews with frontline health workers, patients with chronic diseases, and religious believers and leaders. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression with 95% level of confidence were used for survey findings while deductive thematic analysis was used for in-depth interview findings. Among the total 193,744 respondents, the initial COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate decreased from 60.3% in March 2021 to 44.0% in April 2021, then increased to 88.8% in August 2021. Participants who were able to differentiate true and false statements were 1.2 to 2.4 times more likely to accept vaccine than those who were not. Those who perceived a high risk of infection (Adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 2.6–4.7), perceived vaccine safety (AOR = 1.4–2.4), judged the importance of vaccination (AOR = 2.3–5.1), and had trust in vaccine manufacture (AOR = 1.9–3.2) were also more likely to accept the vaccine. Moreover, higher education (AOR = 1.6–4.1) and living in outbreak areas (AOR = 1.4–3.0) were significantly related to vaccine uptake, except in people with chronic diseases who tended not to accept the vaccine (AOR = 0.7–0.9). This study recommends effective infodemic management and comprehensive public communication, prioritising vulnerable groups such as those with a low level of education and people with chronic conditions. Communication through reliable channels can support higher vaccine acceptance and rapid vaccine rollout. Finally, regular monitoring of misinformation is important such as fact checking support, timely legal actions and specific debunking communication. © 2023 Kosiyaporn et al.

10.1027/1016-9040/a000491,best practices for ethical conduct of misinformation research: a scoping review and critical commentary,"Misinformation can have noxious impacts on cognition, fostering the formation of false beliefs, retroactively distorting memory for events, and influencing reasoning and decision-making even after it has been credibly corrected. Researchers investigating the impacts of real-world misinformation are therefore faced with an ethical issue: they must consider the immediate and long-term consequences of exposing participants to false claims. In this paper, we first present an overview of the ethical risks associated with real-world misinformation. We then report results from a scoping review of ethical practices in misinformation research. We investigated (1) the extent to which researchers report the details of their ethical practices, including issues of informed consent and debriefing, and (2) the specific steps that researchers report taking to protect participants from the consequences of misinformation exposure. We found that fewer than 30% of misinformation papers report any debriefing, and almost no authors assessed the effectiveness of their debriefing procedure. Building on the findings from this review, we evaluate the balance of risk versus reward currently operating in this field and propose a set of guidelines for best practices. Our ultimate goal is to allow researchers the freedom to investigate questions of considerable scientific and societal impact while meeting their ethical obligations to participants. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0281140,correcting vaccine misinformation: a failure to replicate familiarity or fear-driven backfire effects,"Individuals often continue to rely on misinformation in their reasoning and decision making even after it has been corrected. This is known as the continued influence effect, and one of its presumed drivers is misinformation familiarity. As continued influence can promote misguided or unsafe behaviours, it is important to find ways to minimize the effect by designing more effective corrections. It has been argued that correction effectiveness is reduced if the correction repeats the to-be-debunked misinformation, thereby boosting its familiarity. Some have even suggested that this familiarity boost may cause a correction to inadvertently increase subsequent misinformation reliance; a phenomenon termed the familiarity backfire effect. A study by Pluviano et al. (2017) found evidence for this phenomenon using vaccine-related stimuli. The authors found that repeating vaccine “myths” and contrasting them with corresponding facts backfired relative to a control condition, ironically increasing false vaccine beliefs. The present study sought to replicate and extend this study. We included four conditions from the original Pluviano et al. study: the myths vs. facts, a visual infographic, a fear appeal, and a control condition. The present study also added a “myths-only” condition, which simply repeated false claims and labelled them as false; theoretically, this condition should be most likely to produce familiarity backfire. Participants received vaccine-myth corrections and were tested immediately post-correction, and again after a seven-day delay. We found that the myths vs. facts condition reduced vaccine misconceptions. None of the conditions increased vaccine misconceptions relative to control at either timepoint, or relative to a pre-intervention baseline; thus, no backfire effects were observed. This failure to replicate adds to the mounting evidence against familiarity backfire effects and has implications for vaccination communications and the design of debunking interventions. © 2023 Ecker et al.

10.3758/s13421-022-01374-3,the independent effects of source expertise and trustworthiness on retraction believability: the moderating role of vested interest,"Past research suggests that the trustworthiness of a source issuing a retraction of misinformation impacts retraction effectiveness, whereas source expertise does not. However, this prior research largely used expert sources who had a vested interest in issuing the retraction, which might have reduced the impact of those expert sources. We predicted that source expertise can impact a retraction’s believability independent of trustworthiness, but that this is most likely when the source does not have a vested interest in issuing a retraction. Study 1 demonstrated that retractions from an expert source are believed more and lead to less continued belief in misinformation than retractions from an inexpert source while controlling for perceptions of trustworthiness. Additionally, Study 1 demonstrated that this only occurs when the source had no vested interest in issuing the retraction. Study 2 found similar effects using a design containing manipulations of both expertise and trustworthiness. These results suggest that source expertise can impact retraction effectiveness and that vested interest is a variable that is critical to consider when determining when this will occur. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",

At the beginning of the pandemic, science did not yet have a medicinal product for this new disease, and alternative medicines offering “miracle cures” were acclaimed by some citizens looking for an effective treatment for COVID-19. This article aims to study a specific “miracle cure”, namely, chlorine dioxide, a bleaching agent for textiles or paper that also has disinfectant properties (water, surfaces). The dissemination of information about chlorine dioxide to French-speaking people on the social network Twitter from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021 is analyzed using a graph network. The results show that messages promoting misinformation, even if they are likely to be quantitatively less numerous, spread more widely than those based on more reliable information. In addition, this article shows that chlorine dioxide was promoted as an effective cure by medical doctors and peer-reviewed articles, which consequently increased the dissemination of this belief in the social space. Consequently, the process of misinformation entered the sphere of scientific controversy. The boundary between science and misinformation is becoming blurred to the point that it is no longer possible until proven otherwise to call chlorine dioxide a “false miracle cure” but a controversial treatment against COVID-19. © 2023 by the author.",

Using 640 million tweets collected by the Infodemic Observatory and the open access dataset published by Our World in Data regarding COVID-19 worldwide reported cases, we analyze the COVID-19 infodemic vs. pandemic co-evolution from January 2020 to December 2020. We find that a characteristic pattern emerges at the global scale: a decrease in misinformation on Twitter as the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases increases. Similar local variations highlight how this pattern could be influenced both by the strong content moderation policy enforced by Twitter after the first pandemic wave and by the phenomenon of selective exposure that drives users to pick the most visible and reliable news sources available.

In a fake news paradigm, N = 326 participants provided self-report measures of xenophobia and conservatism, and were presented with real news media articles describing crimes that were committed either by putative German (i.e., in-group) or putative immigrant (i.e., out-group) perpetrators. Half of the articles were manipulated, and the participants were asked to rate the articles with respect to the perceived veracity of the article and the reprehensibility of the described criminal offences. Xenophobia, but not conservatism, was associated with poorer news discernment and higher perceived veracity in the immigrant offender condition, but not in the native German offender condition. Reprehensibility was not differentially associated with xenophobia in the two origin-of-offender conditions. The fake news paradigm revealed an out-group bias with respect to the perceived veracity of media news, and this result offers an alternative to measure stereotypes about immigrants more subtly than by explicit self-report. Xenophobia seems to make people less sensitive to hints that could inform them about the falsehood of information. © 2023 by the authors.",
10.1037/xge0001436,the role of political devotion in sharing partisan misinformation and resistance to fact-checking,"Online misinformation is disproportionality created and spread by people with extreme political attitudes, especially among the far-right. There is a debate in the literature about why people spread misinformation and what should be done about it. According to the purely cognitive account, people largely spread misinformation because they are lazy, not biased. According to a motivational account, people are also motivated to believe and spread misinformation for ideological and partisan reasons. To better understand the psychological and neurocognitive processes that underlie misinformation sharing among the far-right, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment with conservatives and far-right partisans in the Unites States and Spain (N= 1,609) and a neuroimaging study with far-right partisans in Spain (N = 36). Far-right partisans in Spain and U.S. Republicans who highly identify with Trump were more likely to share misinformation than center-right voters and other Republicans, especially when the misinformation was related to sacred values (e.g., immigration). Sacred values predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond familiarity, attitude strength, and salience of the issue. Moreover, far-right partisans were unresponsive to fact-checking and accuracy nudges. At a neural level, this group showed increased activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing and norm compliance in response to posts with sacred values. These results suggest that the two components of political devotion—identity fusion and sacred values—play a key role in misinformation sharing, highlighting the identity-affirming dimension of misinformation sharing. We discuss the need for motivational and identity-based interventions to help curb misinformation for high-risk partisan groups. © 2023 American Psychological Association",
10.1037/edu0000842,what are they thinking? exploring college students’ mental processing and decision making about covid-19 (mis)information on social media,"More and more, people are abandoning the active pursuit of news, assuming instead that important information will be pushed to them via their social media networks. This approach to news makes people susceptible to the vast amounts of misinformation online, yet research on the effects of this kind of engagement is mixed. More research is needed on technology incidental learning effects, defined as changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors as a result of being exposed to information while pursuing goals other than learning (e.g., entertainment). In this study, we examined how 51 college students responded to incidental exposure to accurate and inaccurate COVID-19 information delivered via a simulated social media environment. Participants’ verbalizations during think-aloud protocols indicated numerous mental processes including cognition, metacognition, epistemic cognition, motivation, and emotions. Positively valanced mental processing was more often expressed with accurate COVID-19 information and negatively valanced mental processing was more often verbalized with misinformation. Negatively valanced evaluations of knowledge claims and sources predicted less engagement with COVID-19 misinformation posts. However, in many cases the relations among verbalized mental processing and behavioral responses were complex or nonob-vious. For example, participants’ positive metacognition and epistemic cognition verbalizations decreased their likelihood of engaging with accurate COVID-19 information, whereas positive interest was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging with misinformation. Our findings have implications for how to accurately infer people’s beliefs and intentions from their social media behaviors and how to design interventions to help people be more active and thoughtful consumers of online information. © 2023 American Psychological Association.

Is there an advantage to posing as a newspaper online? In this study, I use a survey experiment to assess how readers respond to the same headline delivered to them as a fake newspaper, a fake website, or a real television station. Respondents rated the fake local newspaper as less credible than a real television station or a fake local website, but they rated fake local websites as credibly as real local television. Readers’ preference for following local or national news and the timing of assessment moderate these effects. © 2023 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",

In this paper, we investigate the impact of fake news on perceptions of election processes by drawing on the theory of motivated reasoning. We use survey data on partisan alignment, news consumption habits, and voting methods collected before and after the 2020 United States general election. Our pre-election results indicated that political alignment and the type of news a voter consumes influences their trust perceptions of election processes. These findings were replicated in the post-election results. We also found that Facebook users were more likely to consume fake and hyper-partisan news, whereas people who directly navigate to news websites consume primarily mainstream news sources.

The study aimed to explore how education can help youth develop resilience to malicious deepfakes and the ability to counter disinformation, regardless of context. Sixteen youth between the ages of 18 and 24 participated in a 9-h, cutting-edge, experiential, and reflective learning experience on deepfakes and disinformation informed by personal construct theory (PCT). Participants experienced the creation of deepfakes and assessed their ability to counter disinformation. They delved into their own construct systems and reflected on the genesis of their vulnerabilities. They moved from being unfamiliar with the deepfake phenomenon to becoming empowered digital citizens, motivated to develop their skills in assessing the validity of online information and resisting manipulation regardless of its source. The study provides recommendations for more targeted education about deepfakes and disinformation for youth. Educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers can use these findings to ensure that a well-equipped generation of digital citizens protects society from the growing disinformation plague. With this proof of concept, the next step is to bring this approach to a larger number of youth and contribute to the fight against malicious deepfakes, while developing strategies to integrate PCT-informed learning experiences into education. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.1111/ajsp.12586,do you trust the rumors? examining the determinants of health-related misinformation in india,"Rumors, conspiracies, and health-related misinformation have gone hand-in-hand with the global COVID-19 pandemic, making it hard to obtain reliable and accurate information. Against this background, this study examined the different psychosocial predictors of believing in conspiratorial information related to general health in India. Indian participants (N = 826) responded to measures related to conspiratorial thinking, trust, moral emotions, political ideology, bullshit receptivity, and belief in conspiratorial information in an online survey. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to determine the validity of the instruments used with an Indian sample. Results revealed that lower subjective socioeconomic status, lower trust in political institutions, greater negative moral emotions, greater conspiratorial thinking, and right-leaning political ideology predicted beliefs in health-related conspiratorial information. In highlighting these potential psychosocial determinants of conspiratorial beliefs, we can move toward combating conspiracies effectively and developing necessary interventions for the same. Future work can focus on assessing the moderating effects of political ideology on conspiratorial beliefs in India. © 2023 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",
10.17645/MAC.V11I3.6807,dealing with covid-19 in casual democracies,"This article reports findings from an in‐depth, autoethnographic study of local communities in Denmark and England left behind by local journalism. The study was conducted during—and is thematically framed by—the Covid‐19 pandemic, and it investigates how news, information, and deliberation related to this crisis were facilitated in the communities. The article embarks from ideas of informed citizenship and problems of misinformation and free speech related to the pandemic, and it aims to uncover developments in local democracy in places left behind by local journalism and dominated by platforms. The article argues that “news desert” is not an accurate term describing such places. Instead, such places and their social media platform dependency constitute what is identified as “casual democracies.” In casual local democracies, who and what gets to dominate the local public spheres is difficult to predict, as are the credibility and trustworthiness of local news and information and the interests that local news and information providers serve. Such local democracies are, to a large degree, shaped by informal power structures, individual agency, and the infrastructure of platforms. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

We address these questions by exploring Americans’ ability to recall prominent misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with accuracy perceptions of these claims. Comparing reported recall rates of real and “placebo” headlines, we estimate “true” recall of misinformation is lower than self-reporting suggests but still troubling. Supporters of President Trump, particularly strong news consumers, were most likely to believe misinformation, including ideologically dissonant claims. These findings point to the importance of tailoring corrections to address key correlates of misinformation uptake. © 2023, Harvard Kennedy School. All rights reserved.",
10.17645/mac.v11i4.7190,"doctors fact‐check, journalists get fact‐checked: comparing public trust in journalism and healthcare","Public trust in journalism has fallen disconcertingly low. This study sets out to understand the news industry’s credibility crisis by comparing public perceptions of journalism with public perceptions of another institution facing similar trust challenges: healthcare. Drawing on in‐depth interviews with 31 US adults, we find that although both healthcare and journalism face public distrust, members of the public generally tend to feel more trusting of individual doctors than they do of individual journalists. This is because people (a) perceive doctors to be experts in their field and (b) engage more frequently with doctors than they do with journalists. Consequently, our interviewees described treating their doctors as “fact‐checkers” when it comes to health information they find online, demonstrating trust in their physicians despite their lack of trust in healthcare more broadly. Meanwhile, the opposite unfolds in journalism: Instead of using legitimate news sources to fact‐check potential misinformation, people feel compelled to “fact‐check” legitimate news by seeking alternative sources of corroboration. We conclude that, to improve their credibility among the public, journalists must strike the right balance between persuading the public to perceive them as experts while also pursuing opportunities to engage with the public as peers. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

This article analyzes how this trust can be divided into two components, institutional and non-institutional, which are differentially related to beliefs about COVID-19 and perceptions of receiving misinformation and disinformation. Based on a survey conducted in three European countries (Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom), the study confirms that higher levels of institutional news trust (the trust dimension correlated more with trust in the news media, government, politicians, national and global health organizations, and scientists) are a good predictor of both better knowledge of COVID-19 myths and misstatements, and lower perceptions of being surrounded by false and misleading information about the virus.

Negative beliefs about immigration and immigrants often are embedded in and influenced by historical misinformation. These beliefs can be detected in arguments that view immigration as problematic, not for the immigrants themselves, but rather for the social and economic comfort of White Americans. Immigration, both documented and undocumented, is a controversial political and social issue. It is a lightning rod for debate. Emotions are heightened during conversations about this topic; there is no neutral position on the subject. In response to the lack of experiences with immigrants and immigrant communities with which the majority of his students enter the class, and to help them comprehend the immigration phenomenon authentically, the author focuses on the threshold concept of the sociopolitical context, attempting to guide his students through the conceptual bottlenecks and toward the new understandings. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.",

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a 2 (risk: low vs. high) x 2 (pre-existing attitude: anti gene-editing technology vs. pro gene-editing technology) x 2 (dispute message: absent vs. present) x 2 (media source: Buzzfeed vs NYT) factorial online experiment using a Qualtrics panel (N = 1,080) to examine the impact on individuals' attitudes toward a biotechnology company and trust in the media source. Findings: Results indicate that dispute messages enhance attitudes toward the company but decrease trust in media sources. Interaction effects between pre-existing attitude and the dispute message, along with perceived risk and the dispute message, illustrate stark differences in how individuals with favorable vs. unfavorable pre-existing attitudes assessed the company after viewing the dispute message. Originality/value: This study applies arguments from extant literature about prebunking and debunking misinformation. Specifically, this study investigates how dispute messages, a form of debunking through source derogation, actually impact individuals' perceptions of media credibility and/or their attitudes about the content they are reading.

Participants rated simulated Tweets, then played either the BNG or an unrelated game, then re-rated the Tweets. Playing the BNG lowered rated belief in false Tweets. Here, four teams of undergraduate psychology students each attempted an extended replication of Basol et al., using updated versions of the original Bad News game. The most important extension was that the replications included a larger number of true Tweets than the original study and planned analyses of responses to true Tweets. The four replications were loosely coordinated, with each team independently working out how to implement the agreed plan. Despite many departures from the Basol et al. method, all four teams replicated their key finding: Playing the BNG reduced belief in false Tweets. But playing the BNG also reduced belief in true Tweets to the same or almost the same extent. Exploratory signal detection theory analyses indicated that the BNG increased response bias but did not improve discrimination.

10.1111/issj.12475,acovmd: automatic covid-19 misinformation detection in twitter using self-trained semi-supervised hybrid deep learning model,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, online social networks are extensively utilized, more than ever before by 8.4%, resulting in the propagation of false information related to COVID-19. Despite the existence of many fake news detection models; annotation inconsistency, memory consumption, accurate and self-trained efficient algorithms for detecting the emerging COVID-19 misinformation tweets are still challenging. Hence, the main aim of this work is to come up with a self-trained semi-supervised model that accurately and automatically detects the reliability of emerging COVID-19 tweets without delay. In this work, COVID-19 tweet dataset is created in English Language from the period January 2020 to January 2022 as a ground truth database. Then self-trained semi-supervised hybrid deep learning model is proposed to train both supervised and unsupervised components simultaneously using the created dataset. The proposed model is self-trained repeatedly and the model gets updated to predict the reliability of upcoming COVID-19 tweets that differ from training tweets. We performed experiments multiple times by limiting the percentage amount of labelled tweets shown to the model, namely 80%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% labelled tweets, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 80.92% accuracy and 98.15% accuracy in the 10% and 80% label-seen experiments, respectively. This shows a clear rising trend in the performance curve. Therefore, this technique will be useful for effectively classifying voluminous amounts of emerging tweets generated as part of the COVID-19 infodemic. The proposed model may efficiently use a huge amount of unlabelled tweets and enhance the model's generalization performance. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Historical revisionism plays an essential role in Russian foreign policy towards the post-Soviet space and is in strong relation with the concepts of Near Abroad and Russkii Mir (‘Russian World’) and with certain ideas contained in the neo-Eurasianist Movement. This article examines Russian revisionist narratives disseminated in information and influencing campaigns in Europe and against the West.       Methods: This study uses a mixed methodology combining desk research, including literature review, and analysis of the EUvsDisinfo database of cases identified before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. R esults: The manipulation of historical events has been largely employed by the Kremlin as a tool for foreign interference to achieve strategic objectives. First World War treaties, mainly the Trianon Peace Treaty, as well as the Second World War and the communist and fascist historical experiences in countries within the post-Soviet space, are the pivotal topics from which hostile influencing narratives are built. From the analysis of the EUvsDisinfo database, the article identifies seven topic themes.       Conclusions:  Our findings suggest that pre-emptively elaborated counter-narratives based on historical evidence and sound historiography can be an effective tool against hostile revisionist narratives that exploit vulnerabilities and specific target groups within European societies.

Findings from a US national survey (N = 1003) suggest that NFM perception is positively associated with belief in COVID-19 misinformation and mediates the positive relationship between social media use and false beliefs when NFM is measured as a single-dimensional construct. However, the sub-dimensions of NFM have distinct implications: The reliance on peers and not seeking but feeling informed dimensions work in the same manner as when NFM is treated as a single-dimensional construct, whereas reliance on algorithmic news negatively predicts belief in misinformation and negatively mediates the aforementioned relationship. We also found the mediating role of exposure to misinformation in the relationship between social media use and false beliefs. Implications from these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.4324/9781003224495-7,misinformation detection in news text: automatic methods and data limitations,"We address the difficulty of automatic misinformation detection through state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. Machine learning and natural language processing are often touted as the perfect solutions for the problem of detecting misinformation at scale. We argue, however, that current approaches tend to fall short because of the unavailability of reliably annotated data. Given the scarcity of quality labelled data, we first conduct a data collection effort by leveraging fact-checking websites. Second, we perform a comparative feature analysis of the news articles with true vs false content. Finally, we conduct a set of text classification experiments using a variety of methods and show that the quality of the training data in terms of its labelling system and balanced coverage of topics directly affects the classification accuracy on test data (news articles that the classifier did not see during training). Feature analysis experiments show specific trends of linguistic patterns in fake news articles. In predictive classification, some of these features such as n-grams and semantic features help considerably in recognising false from true news articles and some features such as readability features tend to be less helpful. We also compare deep learning classification models against feature-based models and show that, given the small size of currently available data, feature-based models are more capable of cross-topic generalisation. This result points to the need for automatic classification methods that are informed by linguistic, corpus linguistic, and stylistic research. Finally, we show that using data labelled based on the reputation of the sources does not result in accurate classification of test data, which, in turn, motivates future data collection with reliable tagging and on diverse topics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

The experiment measures the improvement achieved by older adults in the detection of political disinformation thanks to a digital competence course offered through WhatsApp. The study comprises a total sample of 1,029 individu-als, subdivided into a control group (n = 531) and an experimental group (n = 498), from which a qualified experimental subsample (n = 87) was extracted. Results reveal that participants’ political beliefs, ranging from left to right positions, influence their ability to detect misinformation. A progressive political position is associated with higher accuracy in identifying right-biased news headlines and lower accuracy for left-biased headlines. A conservative position is associated with higher accuracy when the news headline has a progressive bias, but lower accuracy when the headline is right-wing. Users are more critical when the headline has a bias against theirs, while they are more likely to believe news that confirms their own beliefs. The study adds evidence on the relevance of cognitive biases in disinformation and supports the convenience of designing specific media literacy actions aimed at older adults. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

Identifying how older adults assess the credibility of health information that they acquire on social media is an important step toward understanding and reducing their susceptibility to health misinformation. In this study, we investigated the credibility assessment strategies used by older WeChat users in China. Following a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with 40 WeChat users 65–85 years old (M = 71.75, SD = 6.65) in China who had acquired health information on WeChat. Results of theoretical thematic analysis revealed five source-based and content-based evaluative strategies: (1) determining the communicative orientation of the source, (2) assessing source reputation, (3) confirming content based on life experiences, (4) checking for exaggeration in claimed effects, and (5) assessing the consistency of content across sources. Older WeChat users’ reliance on certain heuristic cues and their self-reliant approach to assessing information credibility provide contextual explanations for the link between heuristic processing and susceptibility to health misinformation. The findings have implications for anti-misinformation interventions targeting the older population in China and potentially beyond. © 2023 The Author(s).

Survey results from a YouGov panel sample of Black Americans (n = 1,136; 53.5% female) showed that social media use and medical mistrust were positively associated with belief in misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccine, which, in turn, was positively related to vaccine hesitancy through perceived information insufficiency and information seeking intentions. Furthermore, we found that belief in misinformation and subjective norms toward anti-vaccination also serially mediated the association between social media use and medical mistrust with vaccine hesitancy.

In this article, we investigate the drivers of public perceptions and misperceptions of election fairness. We build on theories of rational belief updating and motivated reasoning, and link public opinion data from 82 national elections with expert survey data on disinformation and de facto electoral integrity. We show that, overall, people arrive at largely accurate perceptions, but that disinformation campaigns are indeed associated with less accurate and more polarized beliefs about election fairness. This contributes a cross-nationally comparative perspective to studies of (dis)information processing and belief updating, as well as attitude formation and trust surrounding highly salient political institutions such as elections. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.23860/JMLE-2023-15-2-5,filipino students' competency in evaluating digital media content credibility: 'beginning' to 'emerging' levels,"This study investigates Filipino students' reasoning competency levels in evaluating the credibility of digital media content and whether significant statistical differences exist in their competency by education status, sex, age group, Internet use, or geographical location. Four hundred twenty-four students representing the senior high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate levels responded to four modified versions of the Stanford History Education Group's civic online reasoning tasks. The study found that most students have 'beginning' competency levels in author-checking, fact-checking, and biaschecking but 'emerging' competency levels for image-checking. Younger students and those who spend more hours online have higher mean competency levels for verifying the authenticity of a social media page. Postgraduate students fared better in distinguishing facts from opinions in arguments, while students residing in the Masbate province consistently registered lower mean scores for author- and fact-checking. This study indicates the need to strengthen Filipino students' information/media literacy across educational levels. Copyright:  © 2023 Author(s).",
10.1177/14614448231193709,truth be told: how “true” and “false” labels influence user engagement with fact-checks,"When do users share fact-checks on social media? We describe a survey experiment conducted during the 2019 election in Argentina measuring the propensity of voters to share corrections to political misinformation that randomly confirm or challenge their initial beliefs. We find evidence of selective sharing—the notion that individuals prefer to share pro-attitudinal rather than counter-attitudinal fact-checks. This effect, however, is conditioned by the type of adjudication made by fact-checkers. More specifically, in line with motivated reasoning processes, respondents report a higher intent to share confirmations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “true” rating) compared with refutations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “false” rating). Experimental results are partially confirmed with a regression discontinuity analysis of observational data of Twitter and replicated with additional experiments. Our findings suggest that fact-checkers could increase exposure to their verifications on social media by framing their corrections as confirmations of factually correct information. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1177/13548565231203102,the different worlds of google – a comparison of search results on conspiracy theories in 12 countries,"Search engines play an important role in the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, accentuating the power of global platform companies such as Google to contribute to the digital (information) divide by providing search results of lesser quality in certain countries. We investigated this phenomenon by asking what kind of results users see when they search for information on eleven popular conspiracy theories (CTs) via Google. We analysed links from Google search results (N = 1259) in 12 Western and non-Western countries and 10 languages. Overall, users are more likely to encounter neutral or debunking content when using Google to search for prominent CTs. However, for some CTs, strong country differences in the quality of search results emerge, showing clear correlations between categorical inequalities and unequal access to reliable information. In countries where journalists enjoy less freedom, people enjoy fewer democratic rights and are less able to rely on social elites, Google also provides less enlightening content on CTs than in developed and prosperous democracies. The countries thus disadvantaged are precisely those countries where there is a high propensity to believe in CTs according to comparative survey research. However, in countries where a global language is spoken, for example, English or Portuguese, there is no correlation between structural, country-specific factors and the quality of search results. In this sense, structurally disadvantaged countries seem to benefit from belonging to a larger language community. © The Author(s) 2023.",

The paper deals with fake news as a relevant problem of the modern information society and defines the term “anti-fake” as a way to combat Internet fakes. A sample of fake and anti-fake news was formed from 100 informational political materials. The selected media texts were marked as “fake” and “anti-fake”. The research was based on the main provisions of the cognitive approach in the investigation of media effects within the framework of interrelated models: agenda-setting and framing (analysis of the content and form of presenting information). The main results of the research identified the key patterns of the respondents’ attention and areas of interest (“image”, “text”), as well as their attitude to the proposed stimuli. The research was based on eye-tracking and a survey. The results showed that anti-fake and fake news attract the respondents’ attention; however, anti-fake materials have the maximum impact on the respondents in terms of the number of fixations on the stimulus, the level of memorability, and the level of credibility. “Fake” and “anti-fake” warning labels affect significantly the perception process. © 2023, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Journalism.

When a mock Facebook post with either fake (Study 1) or real (Study 2) news content was attributed to an alternative (vs. a mainstream) news outlet, it was, on average, perceived to be less accurate. Those with beliefs reflecting News Media Literacy demonstrated greater sensitivity to the outlet’s status. This relationship was itself contingent on the strength of the participant’s partisan identity. Strong partisans high in News Media Literacy defended the accuracy of politically consistent content, even while recognizing that an outlet was unfamiliar. These results highlight the fundamental importance of looking at the interaction between user-traits and features of social media news posts when examining learning from political news on social media.

Research indicates that while young adolescent students recognize the detrimental impact that fake news has on society, they lack the knowledge and motivation to combat it. We conducted news literacy training with 101 Hong Kong students (aged 11 to 14) evaluating their news literacy, susceptibility to fake news, perceived responsibility, as well as motivation to engage in protective behaviours. The training significantly enhanced participants’ news media knowledge, perceived control, and reduced their vulnerability to fake news. Participants became more motivated to report fake news, warn others, suggest alternative sources, and manage preferences to filter our problematic news sources. Participants also demonstrated an improved ability to evaluate the credibility of a real-world news article. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the training for this age group and suggest its potential for implementation in junior secondary-school classrooms. © 2023 The Author(s).

Both men are obsessed with a grievance that deeply wounded them; enraged, they are determined to sell a false narrative of being afflicted by forces that should be demolished. Captain Ahab is physically and psychologically dismembered by an earlier confrontation with the white whale which severed his leg. Ahab’s vengeance pulls the entire crew into his false depiction that Moby Dick is either the principal or the agent of evil itself. Defeated presidential candidate for reelection, Donald Trump shares a similar mutilation. His response is to insist on a false narrative of a stolen election; his grievance demands he be reinstated for a second term. Both leaders’ false stories lead in their own trajectories to violence, the response of distorted views that conflate fictions with facts. Violence is embedded deeply in the American psyche. Wounded innocence is the heartbeat of both insurrections, one against nature and the other against the cultural myth of America embodied in the Constitution. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Ipek S.

NA,are people easily duped by disinformation? experimental evidence for open vigilance,"Although it has been commonly believed that people are gullible, the open vigilance (OV) theory advocates that people in the default state of information processing are conservative. By deepening their processing, they likely look for true cues to accept information instead of false cues to reject it. The current paper examined whether the OV theory works in the evaluation of information credibility in two studies. Study 1 found that more elaborated information processing brought higher perceived information credibility, no matter whether the news was true or false. Study 2 found that false cues made little impact on perceived information credibility, but true cues increased it significantly. As for people who had little prior knowledge, enriching either true or false details increased their perceived credibility. These findings enhance the understanding of how people judge true and false news. © 2023 (Wuyao Ding and Yan Ge).

10.1177/14614448231196863,the puzzle of misinformation: exposure to unreliable content in the united states is higher among the better informed,"Healthy news consumption requires limited exposure to unreliable content and ideological diversity in the sources consumed. There are two challenges to this normative expectation: the prevalence of unreliable content online; and the prominence of misinformation within individual news diets. Here, we assess these challenges using an observational panel tracking the browsing behavior of N ≈ 140,000 individuals in the United States for 12 months (January–December 2018). Our results show that panelists who are exposed to misinformation consume more reliable news and from a more ideologically diverse range of sources. In other words, exposure to unreliable content is higher among the better informed. This association persists after we control for partisan leaning and consider inter- and intra-person variation. These findings highlight the tension between the positive and negative consequences of increased exposure to news content online. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1007/978-3-031-25871-8_1,education in the age of misinformation: an introduction,"Concern with mis- and disinformation, its impact on democracies, and the repercussions for public discourse have become increasingly urgent. Despite this urgency and the severity of the outcomes of mis- and disinformation, social media environments remain largely unregulated. The solution is not really, unilaterally within the grasp of education, nor does it rest solely in the province of legislation and policy. Instead, we need much thoughtful debate and advocacy to build a new technological world that can render many of the benefits of freedom, choice, and community, with at least some mitigation of the toxic manipulations of greed, desire for power, and corruption. Education in the Age of Misinformation seeks to explore the significance of the changing nature of youth life and the implications for education. The book pursues various philosophical and conceptual and pedagogical inquiries into the shifting responsibilities of education in a time of hastened change. The explorations in the following chapters notably do not seek to provide solutions in any pat or instrumentalist way. None of the authors propose more technology as the answer to the problems created by neoliberal capitalist technology. Instead, what you will find in the collection are a range of investigations into the nature of knowing, evidence, information, and identity-formation. Authors take up the relationships between what it means to form beliefs and opinions in relation to a cluttered and manipulated information landscape, and what these closely held beliefs mean for the public sphere, democratic engagement, and participatory discourse. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",

Fake news contaminates democracy by blurring the sight and the vision, or by altering the beliefs of citizens on simple everyday matters but also on significant matters such as vaccination, politics, social issues, or public health. Lots of efforts have been conducted in order to tackle the phenomenon. Fact-checking platforms consist of a major step in this issue. Certain cases of fact-checking platforms worldwide seem to work properly and fulfill their strategic goals, although functional and other issues might emerge. This study comes to take the fact-checking platform evolution one step beyond by proposing a new communication model for fake news detection and busting. The proposed model's blueprint is based on the Greek ""Ellinika Hoaxes"" fact-checking platform with some critical reinforcements: More extensive use of crowdsourcing strategies for detecting and busting non-true stories with the aid of AI chatbots in order not only to bust non-true stories but also to rank news outlets, writers, social media personas and journalists for their credibility. This way, serious news outlets, journalists, and media professionals can build their trust and be ranked for the credibility of their services for a more trustful and democratic public sphere. © 2023 The Author(s).",

One recent meta-analysis on the topic concluded that the literature, when assessed as a whole, fails to indicate a direct and statistically identifiable between relationship general social media use and political knowledge. Considering these findings, the present work sought to assess the extent to which general social media use might be conditionally related to political knowledge. To do so, we explored the moderating effect of information-related self-efficacy beliefs. Specifically, building upon general self-efficacy theory and the idea that there exists considerable concern over the extent to which information on social media is factually incorrect, misleading, or biased, we predicted that mis and disinformation self-efficacy (MDSE) beliefs would positively condition the relationship between general social media usage and political knowledge. Contrary to our expectations, the results of three studies indicated that the combination of MDSE and frequent social media use was negatively related to political knowledge.

NA,it’s nothing but a deepfake! the effects of misinformation and deepfake labels delegitimizing an authentic political speech,"Mis- and disinformation labels are increasingly weaponized and used as delegitimizing accusations targeted at mainstream media and political opponents. To better understand how such accusations can affect the credibility of real information and policy preferences, we conducted a two-wave panel experiment (Nwave2 = 788) to assess the longer-term effect of delegitimizing labels targeting an authentic video message. We find that exposure to an accusation of misinformation or disinformation lowered the perceived credibility of the video but did not affect policy preferences related to the content of the video. Furthermore, more extreme disinformation accusations were perceived as less credible than milder misinformation labels. The effects lasted over a period of three days and still occurred when there was a delay in the label attribution. These findings indicate that while mis- and disinformation labels might make authentic content less credible, they are themselves not always deemed credible and are less likely to change substantive policy preferences. © 2023 (Michael Hameleers and Franziska Marquart).

It also looked at how social media organizations review and attempt to verify posted information and what they do when and if they discover fake news Methods: The researchers surveyed 400 Qatari citizens to determine their perceptions of the credibility of government and private social media sites and how that differed from their perception of the credibility of traditional mass media news outlets.The research also addressed the interrelationship between browsing social media for information and disinformation about COVID-19 and a person’s feelings of threat, anxiety, and fear. Results: The study found that social media users may have difficulty telling the difference between information and disinformation. This can increasetheir fear, anxiety, and stress. This relationship appears to be clear, and cuts across all demographic lines. What is unclear is whether fear drives people to increase their social media searching for COVID-19 information, or if increased consumption increases fear? It’s quite possible that it is a circular relationship.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1185699,conspiracy thinking and the long historical shadow of romanticism on authoritarian politics,"Background: Similar effect sizes have been reported for the effects of conspiracy, pseudoscientific, and paranormal beliefs on authoritarian attitudes, which points to a conceptual problem at the heart of the conspiracy literature, namely lack of clarity as to what uniquely defines conspiracy beliefs and whether those unique elements contribute distinctly to authoritarian ideologies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test empirically the predictive power of variance unique to each construct against covariance shared among these constructs when predicting authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Methods: Online survey was administered to 314 participants in 2021 that included a battery of demographic and psychological measures. Hierarchical factor models were used to isolate unique variance from shared covariance among responses to items representing conspiracy, paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs. Structural equation models were used to test their unique and shared effects on authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Results: We found that our combined measurement model of paranormal thinking, conspiracism, and pseudoscience exhibited exceptional model fit, and that each construct was strongly predictive of both SDO and RWA (r = 0.73–0.86). Once the shared covariance was partitioned into a higher order factor, the residual uniqueness in each first order factors was either negatively related or unrelated to authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Moreover, the higher order factor explained the gross majority of variance in conspiracy (R2 = 0.81) paranormal (R2 = 0.81) and pseudoscientific (R2 = 0.95) beliefs and was a far stronger predictor (β = 0.85, p < 0.01) of anti-democratic attitudes than political partisanship (β = 0.17, p < 0.01). Strong partisan identifiers of both parties showed much higher romanticism scores than party moderates. Conclusion and limitations: When predicting authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes, we found no empirically unique contributions of conspiracy beliefs. Instead, we found that a shared factor, representing a ‘romantic’ mindset was the main predictor of authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. This finding potentially explains failures of interventions in stopping the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theory researchers should refocus on the shared features that conspiracy thinking has with other unwarranted epistemic beliefs to better understand how to halt the spread of misinformation, conspiracy thinking, anti-science attitudes, and even global authoritarianism.

The society recognises that false reports pose a real threat to the credibility of information and, ultimately, to the security of society. On the Internet an active audience is a distributor of media content because they are convinced of its truth, and in the online environment they find it in other people. Therefore, the audience seems to be an active amplifier of disinformation (sharing), and thus explicitly as a creator of (unwanted) web content (sharing and commenting). People’s willingness to share disinformation is linked to people’s similar attitudes; it is related to the similarity of faith and to the perception of the message, considered as appropriate and interesting (“I like it”), etc. The term “homogeneity” turns out to be a key term in audience research, and experts speak about a phenomenon that in fact appears to be the main driving force for the dissemination of any content. The aim of the research is to identify and classify the factors that motivate university students to share information on the social networking site Facebook. © (2023) All Rights Reserved.",

What we recognized was a persistent misrepresentation of the activities of the company in its internal accounts. We witnessed how in various reports about the internal operations of jade mining and logistics, workers often provided incorrect data, very approximate numbers, and simplified and partial accounts of their actions. Nevertheless, the company operated smoothly without any evident distraction, as if these partial reports and misinformation could not affect the internal communication and coordination of the enterprise’s operations. Inaccurate numbers paradoxically united people and became artifacts of mutual understanding and agreement. Calibration and correction were endless collective processes. We suggest that accounts in Russia were based not on the principle of accuracy but on the principle of intensity.

NA,social representations of (im)migrants in the first year of the covid-19 pandemic in brazil: a study of online news,"Interested in dialogical and modelling approaches to social representations and communication dynamics, we investigated social representations of (im)migrants constructed in a period and context of intense social vulnerability, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil (February to December 2020). We explored media communication not simply as the unidirectional transmission of collective beliefs to the Brazilian public, but as social representations co-constructed by citizens and expressed in the comments that they posted on social media. We collected data online and constructed two textual corpora. The first corpus included 134 news articles selected with the search terms ‘immigrants’ or ‘refugees’ and ‘Covid-19’. The second corpus included 1295 comments written by the readers of the mentioned articles and posted on the newspapers’ Facebook pages, which we considered a special interactive space for expressing, sharing, and co-constructing social representations. We analyzed the data using the Descending Hierarchical Analysis and Similarity Analysis provided by the software IRaMuTeQ. The results show social dynamics of argumentative polarization about (im)migrants framed in the geo-political Brazilian context at the time of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our case study exemplifies how a context of crisis can reinforce the polarization of existing social representations of (im)migrants in Brazil. We discuss this polarization as an ‘echo chamber’ of informational polarization and fake news contributing to misinformation about Covid-19 worldwide, showing how political decisions may increase xenophobia or facilitate social dialogue. © 2023 Giacomozzi, Andréia Isabel, de Rosa, Annamaria Silvana, da Silva, Mariana Luiza Becker, Gizzi, Flavia & Moraes, Vitor de Sena.",

Here, we provide empirical tests of the importance of metacognition during the pandemic. Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrate that citizens with higher metacognitive sensitivity—where confidence differentiates correct from incorrect COVID-19 beliefs—reported higher willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19, and higher compliance with recommended public health measures. Notably, this benefit of accurate introspection held controlling for the accuracy of COVID-19 beliefs. By demonstrating how vaccination willingness and compliance may relate to insight into the varying accuracy of beliefs, rather than only the accuracy of the beliefs themselves, this research highlights the critical role of metacognitive ability in times of crisis. However, we do not find sufficient evidence to conclude that citizens with higher metacognitive sensitivity were more likely to comply with recommended public health measures when controlling for the absolute level of the confidence citizens had in their COVID-19 beliefs.

This study aims to ascertain the inclination and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy by conducting content analysis and sentiment analysis of the perspectives expressed in comments on videos related to vaccine hesitancy uploaded from India on YouTube. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of the sentiments of the vaccine-hesitant population is done using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis module implemented with Python’s NLTK library to automatically determine the sentiments of the comments. Manual content analysis was performed on 60.09% viewer comments randomly selected from the total comments in 238 videos on vaccine hesitancy originated from India and labelled each comment with labels “Anti”, “Pro”, “Confused”, “Not Applicable” and “Unrelated” labels. Findings: The study found “Mistrust-Government policies”, “Fear-health related consequences”, “Mistrust-Scientific research”, “Vaccine effectiveness and efficacy” and “Misinformation/myths” as the top five determinants for vaccine hesitancy, whereas “Religious beliefs”, “Fear-Economic consequences”, “Side Effects- short-term” and “Fear-mode of administration” found to be the lesser cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. However, the study also investigates changes in the inclination of Indian commenters towards vaccine hesitancy and revolving issues over time. Social implications: Public health policymakers and health communicators may find the study useful in determining vaccine hesitancy factors in India. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its approach.

10.1177/01634437231211678,online misinformation and everyday ontological narratives of social distinction,"Most research into online misinformation has investigated its direct effects—the impact it may have on citizens’ beliefs and behavior. Much less attention has been paid to how citizens themselves make sense of misinformation as a broader social problem. We integrate theories of narrative, identity, cultural capital, and social distinction to examine how people construct the problem of misinformation and their orientation to it. We show how people engage in everyday ontological narratives of social distinction. These involve making a variety of discursive moves to position one’s “taste” in information consumption as superior to others constructed as lower in a social hierarchy. This serves to enhance social status by separating oneself from misinformation, which is presented as “other people’s problem.” We argue that these narratives have significant implications not only for citizens’ vigilance toward misinformation but also their receptiveness to interventions by policymakers, fact-checkers, news organizations, and media educators. © The Author(s) 2023.",

The propagation of disinformation including misleading political advertising serves as a key example of how the Commission’s perception of the EU’s vulnerability to hybrid threats in times of geopolitical instability is shaping its regulatory policies. This article uses the framework of regulatory mercantilism, which argues that in conditions of perceived vulnerability, a state-like actor will reassert regulatory control based on a security logic in areas previously characterized by self-regulatory regimes. This article considers the Commission’s 2019–2024 priorities, and how the spheres of technology, security, and democracy policies are intersecting as a response to hybrid threats. As a result, online platform governance in the EU is being substantially restructured with a move from systems of self-regulation to co-regulation backed by sanction as a means of combating hybrid threats online. The Commission’s “taking back control” from platforms in the context of a digital sovereignty agenda serves as an example of regulatory mercantilism in digital policy, which sees the Commission seek to promote regulatory strength in response to perceived vulnerability. © 2023 The Author(s).

NA,inoculation can reduce the perceived reliability of polarizing social media content,"Little research is available on psychological interventions that counter susceptibility to polarizing online content. We conducted 3 studies (n1 = 472, n2 = 193, n3 = 772) to evaluate whether psychological resistance against polarizing social media content can be conferred, using the Bad News game, a “technique-based inoculation” intervention that simulates a social media feed. We investigate (1) whether technique-based inoculation can reduce susceptibility to content designed to fuel intergroup polarization; (2) whether technique-based inoculation can offer cross-protection against misinformation techniques that people were not inoculated against; and (3) whether political ideology plays a role in how people engage with anti-misinformation interventions. In Studies 1 and 3 (but not Study 2), we found that technique-based inoculation significantly reduces the perceived reliability of polarizing content and offers partial cross-protection against untreated misinformation techniques. We found no effect for attitudinal certainty and news-sharing intentions. Finally, we report preliminary evidence that people may choose to engage with politically congruent news topics within the intervention. © 2023 (Isobel Harrop, Jon Roozenbeek, Jens Koed Madsen, and Sander van der Linden).

10.1037/xap0000480,scrolling through fake news: the effect of presentation order on misinformation retention,"Sharing information in real time leaves little room for double-checking. This leads to an abundance of low-quality information that might later need to be corrected and provides a foundation on which false beliefs can arise. Today, the general population often consults digital media platforms for news content. Because of the sheer amount of news articles and the various ways digital media platforms organize material, readers may encounter news articles with faulty content and their subsequent corrections in various orders. They might read the misinformation before the corrected version or vice versa. We conducted two studies in which participants were presented with two reports of a news event: one report that included a piece of misinformation and one report in which that misinformation was retracted. The order in which the two reports were encountered was manipulated. In Study 1, the retraction contained an explicit reminder of the misinformation; in Study 2, it did not. Neither Study 1 nor Study 2 found an effect of presentation order on misinformation reliance. These findings run counter to predictions by those accounts of the continued influence effect that suggest a better encoding of retractions and subsequent lesser reliance on misinformation when retractions are encountered first. © 2023 American Psychological Association",

Participants reported using legacy media as a main source of information about COVID-19 vaccines and encountered conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media. Using the Health Belief Model as the theoretical lens, we found individuals’ and family members’ perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 played a part in participants wanting to find and get the vaccine. Provider recommendations may have served as cues to action. Ease of receiving the vaccines at church and pharmacies may have served to boost participants self-efficacy. Perceived barriers include vaccine specific reasons such as the fast pace of initial authorization, side effects, and long-term effects along with conspiracy theories. Prevailing information gaps regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the resulting uncertainty are discussed. Understanding information sources and the trust Hispanic communities place in these sources is important in designing effective health messages. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1080/17524032.2023.2237693,inspiring g(re)en z: unraveling (para)social bonds with influencers and perceptions of their environmental content,"The affordances of digital platforms have blurred the boundaries between environmentalism, celebrity status, and science communication. As such, nowadays, many social media influencers–who have risen to fame due to successful self-branding–act as educators and role models for environmental matters. To illuminate the appeal of green influencers and the relationship they develop with their followers, we conducted in-depth interviews employing a novel digital go-along approach. Findings suggest that relationships with green influencers are fueled by the entanglement of relational and substantive environmental content. This mix underlies followers’ perceptions of sharing a reality and perceiving the influencer as a super peer. As for the characteristics of the follower-influencer bond, we show that followers appreciate the potential for reciprocity, while the relationship itself remains mainly asymmetric. We furthermore elucidate three key components that explain the unique appeal of influencers’ environmental communication: nuanced environmentalism, perceived reproducibility and trust in autodidactic expertise. KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Influencers’ ability to provide reproducible environmental recommendations make them valuable collaboration partners for pro-environmental organizations and political actors. Youth especially appreciate that influencers offer non-judgmental, nuanced pro-environmental advice, which informs other pro-environmental actors trying to reach young people. Ascribing credibility to influencers based on their autodidactic skills rather than due to their formal training puts young people at risk of misinformation, which should be accounted for in influencer support programs, media literacy trainings, and public awareness campaigns. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.4324/9781003224495-9,debunking fake news through the multimodal composition of internet memes,"This chapter reports on an implementation of inoculation theory, which was devised at the University of Salento and which aims to educate people to resist persuasion as well as to enhance their critical thinking by means of engaging and interactive multimedia texts. The implementation under discussion resorts to memes, the viral text types that are shared over the Internet and which can be used to spread misinformation. In this study, memes are presented as a tool helping to counteract fabrication in fake news. Twenty-six undergraduate students in modern literatures, representing people that communicate online and consume online texts, were asked to design memes where the interaction between linguistic and extralinguistic elements is meant to produce humorous and derogatory representations that should attract the recipients’ interests before proposing to them facts about the COVID-19 pandemic from reliable sources. The analysis of the selected corpus of samples will illustrate the extent to which the multimodal composition of the original creations activates inferential processes whereby addressees are urged to question the truthfulness of the fake news items that are diffused via social media posts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

Across two experimental studies, Study 1 finds a direct link between the sharing intention of social media posts containing disinformation and an interactive effect of AOT on such bandwagon heuristics. Study 2 demonstrates that for posts containing disinformation, the number of likes has a significant influence on sharing intentions, but not credibility, whilst comments have a significant influence on credibility, but not sharing intentions. Furthermore, Study 2 found the influence of AOT attenuates the effects of such heuristics. Overall, this research contributes to the extant literature and practice by demonstrating the influence bandwagon heuristics and AOT have on disinformation over social media.

This research aims to understand if the public’s assessment of the credibility of information could be more accurate with the help of transparency features that act as heuristic cues under the elaboration likelihood model and the heuristic‐systematic model, and if the cues increase cognitive absorption. Two between‐subjects studies were performed, one with a young demographic (N = 68) and another with a representative sample of the adult population (N = 325). The stimuli contained information boxes designed to indicate that the story was not written in a traditional journalistic style (message cues) and missing background information on the author (source cues). Results show significant effects of the cues on credibility assessment and cognitive absorption. © 2023 by the author(s).",

We examine fact-checker credibility perceptions as a mechanism to explain variance in fact-checking effectiveness across sources, while taking individual differences into account (i.e., analytic thinking and alignment with the fact-check verdict). An experiment with 859 participants revealed few differences in effectiveness across fact-checking sources but found that sources perceived as more credible are more effective. Indeed, the data show that perceived credibility of fact-check sources mediates the relationship between exposure to fact-checking messages and their effectiveness for some source types. Moreover, fact-checker credibility moderates the effect of alignment on effectiveness, while analytic thinking is unrelated to fact-checker credibility perceptions, alignment, and effectiveness. Other theoretical contributions include extending the scope of the credibility-persuasion association and the MAIN model to the fact-checking context, and empirically verifying a critical component of the two-step motivated reasoning model of misinformation correction. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1017/epi.2023.46,partisan epistemology and misplaced trust,"The fact that each of us has significantly greater confidence in the claims of co-partisans - those belonging to groups with which we identify - explains, in large part, why so many people believe a significant amount of the misinformation they encounter. It's natural to assume that such misinformed partisan beliefs typically involve a rational failure of some kind, and philosophers and psychologists have defended various accounts of the nature of the rational failure purportedly involved. I argue that none of the standard diagnoses of the irrationality of misinformed partisan beliefs is convincing, but I also argue that we ought to reject attempts to characterize these beliefs as rational or consistent with epistemic virtue. Accordingly, I defend an alternative diagnosis of the relevant epistemic error. Specifically, I maintain that such beliefs typically result when an individual evaluating testimony assigns more weight to co-partisanship than he ought to under the circumstances, and consequently believes the testimony of co-partisans when better alternatives are available.

10.4324/9781003190363-15,using mimetic and rhetorical theory to critique a disinformation consensus: the problem of “personal vigilance”,"Foreign disinformation activities aimed at the United States involve using social media to mimic domestic political discourse that exacerbates societal division and polarisation. As part of the U.S. response, officials have urged citizens to increase their “personal vigilance” and avoid engaging with social media content of dubious provenance. However, asking citizens to recognise and avoid disinformation does not adequately address the complex allure of identity affirming messages. Mimetic and rhetorical theory offer resources for critiquing the personal vigilance approach, as well as demonstrating how social media facilitates communicative processes of imitation and adaptation. In this view, the rhetorical process of identification can transmogrify disinformation’s deceptive intent and deleterious consequences. Mimetic and rhetorical theory subsequently challenge the U.S. counter-disinformation consensus. Combined, they indicate that an effective personal vigilance approach requires extraordinary citizen self-awareness regarding vulnerabilities that arise from unwarranted confidence in their ability to resist the pleasures of imitation. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rubén Arcos, Irena Chiru and Cristina Ivan; individual chapters, the contributors.",

Examples from various African countries such as Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania are examined to highlight the actual situation. Communication and health communication theories discussed are: Theory of Reasoned Action, Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Protection Motivation Theory. The role the media (Newspapers, magazines, radio, television and social media networks) have played in persuading people to accept to be vaccinated and to wear masks is discussed. Studies conducted in Africa reveal that different countries have had to deal with different reactions towards COVID-19 communication. Studies reviewed from other continents show that what is applicable there can also work in Africa. African, Chinese and Iranian examples are discussed to prove that the above-named theories can also be applied in Africa to persuade people to maintain COVID-19 protocols and to accept to be vaccinated. Social media users communicated COVID-19 messages but most of them have participated more in spreading misinformation and propaganda about COVID-19 just as it happened during the Ebola pandemic in West Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",
10.1080/00913367.2023.2261027,through the partisan looking glass: evidence of asymmetric credibility and persuasion effects of unverified negative brand information on social media,"Online disinformation often plays to partisan identities to grab attention and elicit strong reactions in polarized societies. In this research note, the perceived credibility and persuasiveness of unverified negative information about brands posted on social media and the role therein of congruencies among the partisan identity of the self, the source of information, and the brand (i.e., liberal versus conservative) are investigated. Following marketing research on “identity congruency” and “motivated reasoning” effects, three experiments demonstrate that self-source, self-brand, and source-brand partisan identity (in)congruencies can influence the credibility and persuasiveness of unverified negative brand information. However, the observed partisan identity (in)congruency effects were found to be asymmetric; that is, their nature or magnitude was dependent on whether liberal or conservative partisan identities were involved. This research note also emphasizes that unverified negative brand information posted on social media can have a substantial impact on brand evaluations, even if consumers doubt its veracity. These findings are relevant not only for advertisers (on social media) and brand managers but also for researchers who study online disinformation. It is hoped that this research note will lead to further research on the nature and drivers of asymmetric partisan identity (in)congruency effects in advertising and other communications contexts. © Copyright © 2023, American Academy of Advertising.",
10.1037/xge0001463,the contingent reputational benefits of selective exposure to partisan information,"Individuals often preferentially avoid information that contradicts and seek information that aligns with their prior beliefs—a tendency referred to as “selective exposure.” Traditionally, prior research has focused on intrapersonal drivers of selective exposure, including avoidance of cognitive dissonance. We take a complementary approach by investigating the conditions under which interpersonal concerns drive selective exposure. Drawing on a large literature on impression management, we test a social signaling model of selective exposure, which predicts that (a) individuals shift their information selection decisions to signal to observers and (b) observers reward such shifts. We test this model in the domain of partisan politics in the United States across five financially incentivized, preregistered experiments (N = 3,598). Our results extend prior theory by identifying three key contingencies: the type of task on which observers expect to collaborate with actors, alignment of group membership between observers and actors, and the magnitude of demonstrated selective exposure. Overall, we find that tailoring one’s information selection decisions can indeed have strategic value—but only under certain theoretically predictable conditions. Our work also identifies an actor–observer misalignment: While observers are sensitive to the type of future interaction with an actor, the actors themselves do not intuit this sensitivity. In the era of social media, when information selection decisions are more public than ever and the spread of misinformation is pervasive, understanding the ways in which reputational considerations shape decision making not only illuminates why selective exposure persists, but also suggests novel mitigation strategies. © 2023 American Psychological Association",
10.1080/10510974.2023.2246210,does tone of comments matter?: exploring the role of uncivil comments and political orientation on weakening belief in fake news and eliciting anger,"Although fake news has become a serious social issue and the detrimental effects of fake news have become more salient in online environments, scholars have not extensively studied the role of uncivil comments posted about fake news. As fake news itself is typically partisan and tends to deceive publics for specific purposes (e.g. gaining support for specific agendas), it usually induces heated discussion and uncivil commenting, especially among politically partisan individuals. Thus, in this study, we explored the effects of uncivil comments following fake news and political orientation on belief in fake news and anger. We used two issues to explore these mechanisms: climate change and immigration. Our results show that uncivil comments following fake news weakened participants’ belief in fake news about climate change. Moreover, uncivil comments made people angrier after viewing fake news about each issue. A significant moderating effect of political orientation on this relationship also emerged. Conservatives, who generally had a lower level of anger toward fake news than liberals, were more likely to feel anger when they viewed uncivil comments rather than civil comments.

10.1177/02666669231206784,analyzing patterns of political news evaluation among university students in northeast thailand,"Through social media and digital platforms, fake news and both professional as well as non-professional news sources are increasingly circulated, thus having a greater impact on people's lives and society. As a result, evaluating news has emerged as a crucial skill. However, it is yet unclear what variables contribute to this increase. To offer more insights, this study attempts to investigate through political news accessibility the factors influencing political news assessment of university students in Northeast Thailand. This study was a quantitative research, and the theory underlying it was news literacy. 1200 samples from undergraduate students from state, private, and autonomous universities were obtained through a multi-stage sampling. 400 questionnaires, utilized as a research tool, were distributed to each type of university for data collection. In order to examine the reliability of the research instrument, Cronbach's alpha was also used in a pre-test stage along with a content validity analysis of the questionnaire. For all elements, the alpha coefficient was 0.93. The findings demonstrated that political news assessment was most influenced by political news accessibility, which is the intervening variable (Beta = 0.265); followed by political news exposure from social media (Beta = 0.217); inner drives for the follow-up of political news (Beta = 0.190); influence of groups and social networks (Beta = 0.170); specific characteristics of the Internet (Beta = 0.151); importance of political news (Beta = 0.147); political news exposure from websites (Beta = 0.099); benefits of political news (Beta = 0.075); and political news exposure from print media (Beta = 0.042). The student characteristic factor, motivation for political news exposure factor, and political news exposure factor accounted for 67.45 percent of the variance in explaining political news evaluation among Thai students, through political news accessibility (R2 = 0.6745). Consequently, improving these elements will lead to better political news evaluation. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1017/pan.2023.21,the effect of fox news on health behavior during covid-19,"In the early weeks of the 2020 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Fox News Channel advanced a skeptical narrative that downplayed the risks posed by the virus. We find that this narrative had significant consequences: in localities with higher Fox News viewership - exogenous due to random variation in channel positioning - people were less likely to adopt behaviors geared toward social distancing (e.g., staying at home) and consumed fewer goods in preparation (e.g., cleaning products, hand sanitizers, and masks). Using original survey data, we find that the effect of Fox News came not merely from its long-standing distrustful stance toward science, but also due to program-specific content that minimized the COVID-19 threat. Taken together, our results demonstrate the significant impact that misinformation in media coverage can exert on viewers' beliefs and behavior, even in high-stakes situations. © The Author(s), 2023.

Recent research has indicated perceived potential danger of disinformation and ""fake news"" in Switzerland (Hermann & Bühler, 2018) and emphasized the risk of narrowing diversity in public opinion as a result of targeted disinformation campaigns (Maschmeyer, 2021). This case-study examines propaganda traditions of Russia and investigates the recent digital disinformation campaign in Switzerland during the first months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Based on the grounded theory methodology and qualitative content-analyses of articles in alternative German-language media three central themes were identified: the theme accenting opposition Russia-West (1), the theme related to justification of war (2), and the theme presenting accusations western media of spreading propaganda (3). The study also revealed inconsistency in messages related to the same theme and specific persuasive techniques applied throughout the texts in order to increase credibility of communicated messages and their emotional impact. The case study also provided some limited results on adjusting messages to Swiss audience by mentioning the local politician, World Economic Forum, and particular media in Switzerland. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.14456/tureview.2023.10,conceptualizing a framework for social media data sharing,"Information sharing is one of the most important trends on social media nowadays, but detailed research on what can encourage it is still in the early stages. This exploratory work examines three categories of antecedents to data sharing which have come up in the literature: sharing benefits, social influences, and trust/risk issues, particularly associated with reliable vs. false information. A very simple model of direct impacts shows that information value, voluntary sharing, and false data risk significantly impact data sharing, but the other antecedents do not. The dependent variable was explicitly about sharing factual data, and these results suggest some feeling of social obligation to voluntarily share, particularly when respondents are well aware of the prevalence of misinformation.

This phenomenon impacts ideologies, politics and public health. The 2016 US presidential elections, the Brexit referendum, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have been ideal scenarios for the spreading of fake news and hoaxes, due to the massive dissemination of information. Assuming that fake news mixes reliable and unreliable information, we propose RUN-AS (Reliable and Unreliable Annotation Scheme), a fine-grained annotation scheme that enables the labelling of the structural parts and essential content elements of a news item and their classification into Reliable and Unreliable. This annotation proposal aims to detect disinformation patterns in text and to classify the global reliability of news. To this end, a dataset in Spanish was built and manually annotated with RUN-AS and several experiments using this dataset were conducted to validate the annotation scheme by using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The experiments evidence the validity of the annotation scheme proposed, obtaining the best F1m , 0.948, with the Decision Tree algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s).",

Previous work has shown that both trait-related and situational factors influence the spread of fake news on social media. However, we have limited insight into how the specific contextual conditions that shape information processing on social media contribute to the proliferation of misinformation. In this article, we posit that people are more susceptible to spreading misinformation because they engage selectively, briefly, and heuristically with political news on social media. To test our argument, we rely on a pre-registered online experiment conducted in two Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, Hungary and Romania. We designed this experiment to reflect the fast and impulsive decision-making that is characteristic of online behavior on social media platforms. The results support the idea that individuals’ tendency to disseminate fake news is amplified by conditions of fast-paced and impulsive decision-making. The effect is particularly pronounced among respondents with higher right-wing authoritarian attitudes. This suggests that the fast and intuition-reliant nature of decision-making on social media encourages the spread of such misinformation that is in line with individuals’ ideological beliefs, which could increase social polarization in societies. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

A significant number of news stories are fake and are published to serve certain purposes and ideologies. The present study examines how Arab social media users respond to fake news in Arabic in reference to van Dijk’s concept of the ideological square. A dataset of fake news was collected from Twitter, now X platform, comprising tweets on various events. After preprocessing, a topic-modeling algorithm was applied to the dataset to reveal its latent aspects. Instances of the featured topics in the dataset were then analyzed in accordance with the sociocognitive approach to critical discourse analysis. The findings demonstrate that fake news was leveraged to promote ideological struggle between social groups. Some social media users may interact with misinformation without evaluating its credibility and, therefore, express ideologically loaded beliefs for or against the subject matter of the news story. Fake news stories were also exploited for business and marketing. Misinformation’s discourse structure involves ideological polarization, self-identification and goal-description, and violates norms and values. The discursive structure and strategies revolve around the ideological square. © The Author(s) 2023.",

10.1007/s13164-023-00716-7,conspiracy theory belief: a sane response to an insane world?,"Are conspiracy theory beliefs pathological? That depends on what is meant by ""pathological."" This paper begins by unpacking that ill-defined and value-laden term before making the case that widespread conspiracy theory belief should not be conceptualized through the “othering’ perspective of individual psychopathology. In doing so, it adopts a phenomenological perspective to argue that conspiracy theory beliefs can be reliably distinguished from paranoid delusions based on falsity, belief conviction, idiosyncrasy, and self-referentiality. A socio-epistemic model is then presented that characterizes the broader phenomenon of conspiracy theory belief as a product of a sick society plagued by epistemic mistrust and vulnerability to misinformation that is ubiquitous in today’s post-truth world. Finally, it is proposed that for individuals, the harmfulness of conspiracy theory belief is less related to belief content as it is to belief conviction and degree of self-relevant consequentiality. Staging conspiracy theory belief in terms of ideological commitment offers a conceptual framework to estimate behavioral risks and test hypotheses about the effectiveness of interventions along a continuum of belief conviction and associated socio-epistemic dynamics. Interventions should target not only individuals, but the dysfunctional social conditions that give rise to the pervasive and enduring phenomenon of conspiracy theory belief. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

Specifically, it aims to investigate fact-checkers’ outputs regarding verification genres, scrutinized actors, types of verified falsehoods, and inspected platforms. The focus on Brazil stems from its reputation as a disinformation hub, owing to social polarization, populist communication, high social media use, low media trust, and intense WhatsApp penetration. Consequently, fact-checking agencies have proliferated within Brazil’s media landscape. To provide some hints about the fact-checkers’ editorial choices, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of verification articles (n = 349) published during the second round of the presidential election by four leading fact-checking organizations: Lupa and Aos Fatos (independents), Estadão Verifica (press), and AFP Checamos (global news agency). The results reveal a prioritization of combating online falsehoods (82.2%) spread by anonymous sources, as opposed to verifying public figures’ statements (5.5%), a trend already observed in other media systems. Although Meta’s social networks and Twitter are primarily monitored, other platforms such as TikTok, Kwai, and Telegram are increasingly gaining fact-checkers’ attention. Fact-checkers predominantly scrutinized anonymous disinformation agents. Moreover, they primarily debunked falsehoods targeting the opposition, legacy media, social networking companies, and the Supreme Electoral Court. Despite the anonymity, 77.4% of the verified falsehoods were found to be beneficial to Bolsonaro, while 12% were advantageous to Lula da Silva. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Through a qualitative longitudinal analysis of data from the online posts of a prominent branch of the anti-lockdown freedom movement, we identify the movement’s core narratives, motivations, and forms of action, revealing how this social movement developed into a complex form of anti-government extremist movement that combines and conflates anti-institutional, anti-elite sentiments, and anti-government attitudes and beliefs through conspiratorial narratives. Drawing upon interrelated strands of social movement theory and the broader body of research on conspiracy theories and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on radicalisation to extremism, we offer a conceptual framework to understand the movement’s emergence, consolidation, and development. This study furthers our understanding of how conspiracies and disinformation can be utilised and fed into anti-government extremism during times of crisis and emergency. © 2023 ICCT",

The efficacy of fact-checking often decreases, if not backfires, when the fact-checking messages contradict individual audiences’ political stance. To explore ways to minimize such politically biased processing of fact-checking messages, an online experiment (N = 645) examined how different source labels of fact-checking messages (human experts vs. AI vs. crowdsourcing vs. human experts-AI hybrid) influence partisans’ processing of fact-checking messages. Results showed that AI and crowdsourcing source labels significantly reduced motivated reasoning in evaluating the credibility of fact-checking messages whereas the partisan bias remained evident for the human experts and human experts-AI hybrid source labels. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Eight pairs of adult participants were recruited from diverse cultural backgrounds to participate online in joint fact-checking of suspect Tweets. To examine their collaborative deliberations we developed a novel experimental design and analytical model. Our analyses indicate that the salience of online information to people’s cultural identities influences their decision to fact-check it, that fact-checking deliberations are often non-linear and iterative, that collaborative fact-checking leads people to revise their initial judgments about the credibility of online information, and that when online information is highly salient to people’s cultural identities, they apply different standards of credibility when fact-checking it. In conclusion, we propose that cultural identity is an important factor in the fact-checking of online information, and that joint fact-checking of online information by people from diverse cultural backgrounds may have significant potential as an educational tool to reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation.

Special attention has been paid to how social media discourse, rather than focusing on the correct identification of sources and voices, can end up constructing trust and credibility by emphasising shared identities and positions, usually in opposition to other views. Studies on “echo chambers” look at how the views of others are systematically rejected and used instrumentally to support one’s own beliefs. Twitter discourse is often a case in point. The focus of our analysis is on the language that manifests the writer’s position, starting from the concept of engagement as defined in Martin and White’s (2005) appraisal framework. This indicates the speaker’s degree of commitment to what is being expressed and manifests the speaker’s attitudes to opening and closing the dialogic space for external views. Using a corpus of tweets and one of journalistic texts on the pandemic, we test the hypothesis that the space given to dialogic contraction on Twitter may be wider than that provided by traditional journalism. The study - based on frequency analysis, concordance analysis, and word embedding - centres on a predefined list of appraisal markers indicating contraction or expansion. We look at the relative frequency of these markers and at their role in the ongoing debate. The results show that there are specific markers that dominate Twitter discourse: adversative “but”, negative “no”/“not”, and cognitive verbs like “know” and “think”. A closer analysis of concordances of negatives and cognitive verbs shows that it is possible to identify patterns that are clear signals of explicit denials, whether in representing a position or rejecting it, and that the verbs are used as markers of ideological positioning. Twitter thus turns out to be characterised by positioning that emphasises contrasting views and denial of other positions. (302 words). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

10.1177/14648849231212737,what feels like news? young people’s perceptions of news on instagram,"What do young people consider “news”? Now that news is dislocated from dedicated outlets of news organizations, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish from other cultural forms, including entertainment, advertising and misinformation. Especially on visual social media, where many different forms, topics and tones circulate, so-called “news feeds” offer blends of content that only partially match traditional journalistic conceptualizations. This paper advances current conceptual debates around news(-ness), by going beyond what is culturally accepted and cognitively recognized as news. We make an argument for the importance of capturing young people’s affective and tacit understandings of news, by analyzing what feels like news to them on Instagram. These judgments matter because what users understand as news or non-news also affects their assessments of trustworthiness and reliability. Drawing upon a three-wave study (2020-2022) employing in-depth interviews with and walk-throughs of the Instagram feeds of N = 111 Dutch smartphone users (aged 16-25), we find that while young people are strongly aware of societal norms around what news is or should be, these cognitive understandings do not necessarily align with what they experience as news(-like) within their everyday practices. Although some users do employ traditional journalistic conceptualizations of news, others negotiate or challenge such definitions through processes of compartmentalization, homogenization or reconceptualization, to mitigate tensions between what they cognitively recognize versus what they affectively perceive as news. Consequently, we argue that more inclusive epistemological approaches are needed to comprehend young people’s shifting experiences of news and conceptualize news from an audience perspective. © The Author(s) 2023.",

The incident and the baseless claims that ignited the insurrection highlight the shortcomings of media platforms at curbing misinformation. To better understand factors that influence media credibility, the researchers conducted a survey across a nationwide sample of US adults (N = 413). Study participants evaluated the credibility of a political news article about the congressional response to the insurrection and assessed the likelihood they would share the article on social media. Additionally, a survey of hostile media perceptions was conducted to determine potential correlations between online behaviors and offline political ideologies. Study findings offer evidence of political affiliation as a strong predictor for specific cognitive heuristic processes related to political incidents and online news. The correlations between media hostility, perceived credibility, and online share likelihood highlight differences in cognitive engagement across political lines. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.26522/ssj.v17i3.3909,living among confederate icons: perpetuating white supremacist beliefs and blindness to black suffering,"Almost 160 years after the American Civil War, where the Union defeated the Confederacy and ended slavery in the United States, approximately 1,910 tributes remain to Confederate military leaders located on public property in the 11 original Confederate states, particularly in cities with an exceptionally high density of Black residents. To Blacks, this iconography delivers a clear message of White supremacy. Six states have enacted laws to protect and preserve these memorials, making it almost impossible to use the court system to move them to private property. This paper explores connections between support for a myth called the Lost Cause, which is a revisionist history intended to spread misinformation about the true cause of the American Civil War, and attitudes toward placement of Confederate symbols on public land. We show that there is significant belief in the Lost-Cause myth among many White U.S. Southerners. Furthermore, we find those who believe most in the myth are the least likely to want to move the monuments or end taxpayer support for their maintenance. © (2023). All Rights Reserved.",

This article conducted two randomized controlled 2 × 2 × 2 experiments (N = 518) to explore the influence of heuristic cues (including the number of followers, popularity, and description as variables) generated by the system and video characteristics (including definition, duration, and editing as variables). The results suggest that the number of the source’s followers and the video’s popularity are positively associated with perceived credibility. Moreover, high-definition deepfakes are more efficient at deceiving viewers. Interestingly, an interaction effect indicates that it is not easy for users to detect editing traces in relatively long videos (greater than 30 s). Our study is an initial step to better understand how individuals assess video credibility and lay the grounds for approaches to combat the negative effects of deepfakes. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.2196/49183,chatgpt versus consultants: blinded evaluation on answering otorhinolaryngology case–based questions,"Background: Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (Open AI), are increasingly used in medicine and supplement standard search engines as information sources. This leads to more “consultations” of LLMs about personal medical symptoms. Objective: This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance in answering clinical case–based questions in otorhinolaryngology (ORL) in comparison to ORL consultants’ answers. Methods: We used 41 case-based questions from established ORL study books and past German state examinations for doctors. The questions were answered by both ORL consultants and ChatGPT 3. ORL consultants rated all responses, except their own, on medical adequacy, conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility using a 6-point Likert scale. They also identified (in a blinded setting) if the answer was created by an ORL consultant or ChatGPT. Additionally, the character count was compared. Due to the rapidly evolving pace of technology, a comparison between responses generated by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 was included to give an insight into the evolving potential of LLMs. Results: Ratings in all categories were significantly higher for ORL consultants (P<.001). Although inferior to the scores of the ORL consultants, ChatGPT’s scores were relatively higher in semantic categories (conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility) compared to medical adequacy. ORL consultants identified ChatGPT as the source correctly in 98.4% (121/123) of cases. ChatGPT’s answers had a significantly higher character count compared to ORL consultants (P<.001). Comparison between responses generated by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 showed a slight improvement in medical accuracy as well as a better coherence of the answers provided. Contrarily, neither the conciseness (P=.06) nor the comprehensibility (P=.08) improved significantly despite the significant increase in the mean amount of characters by 52.5% (n= (1470-964)/964; P<.001). Conclusions: While ChatGPT provided longer answers to medical problems, medical adequacy and conciseness were significantly lower compared to ORL consultants’ answers. LLMs have potential as augmentative tools for medical care, but their “consultation” for medical problems carries a high risk of misinformation as their high semantic quality may mask contextual deficits. © 2023 The Author(s).",
10.4324/9781003245131-52,"fake news, truth, and democracy","Journalism and democracy have been intertwined for centuries. As democratic societies emerged in Europe, so did journalistic outlets that interpreted political issues, scrutinized politicians, and shaped public opinion. The lofty Fourth Estate-watchdog of governments and educator of publics-is a key pillar upholding mature democracies. But the stability of that pillar depends on public trust, rooted in expectations of accuracy and objectivity. A number of factors may undermine that trust, including the publication-either intentional or accidental-of false stories, fabrication of sources, and manipulation or misinterpretation of facts. Moreover, trust declines in the wake of public accusations of falsehood and bias even when stories are fair and true. This chapter explores key moments in the history of journalism when truth prevailed and publics counted on news outlets as crucial components of democratic life, as well as cases when journalists fell short of the expected standards or the allegations of political adversaries proved too difficult to overcome in the public eye. Moreover, the chapter emphasizes the importance of a diverse media landscape to an informed democracy, highlighting alternative outlets that have taken up the mantle as journalistic pillars of democracy when mainstream organizations have failed in that regard. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Melita M.

10.1017/XPS.2023.20,testing the effect of information on discerning the veracity of news in real time,"Despite broad adoption of digital media literacy interventions that provide online users with more information when consuming news, relatively little is known about the effect of this additional information on the discernment of news veracity in real time. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of how information impacts discernment of news veracity has been hindered by challenges of external and ecological validity. Using a series of pre-registered experiments, we measure this effect in real time. Access to the full article relative to solely the headline/lede and access to source information improves an individual's ability to correctly discern the veracity of news. We also find that encouraging individuals to search online increases belief in both false/misleading and true news.

10.4324/9781003224495-6,a model for understanding and assessing semi-fake scientific news reporting,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance - as well as the difficulty - of providing the general public with reliable news reporting on scientific findings. The overabundance of scientific news published during the pandemic made it extremely difficult for much of the lay public to assess the reliability of the information made available by conventional and unconventional news outlets. Particularly challenging to assess were news articles which, while not reporting any falsehood, failed to report scientific findings accurately, thus (typically unwittingly) contributing to spreading misinformation. This study outlines a model for understanding and assessing this type of scientific news reporting, which is here called “semi-fake” news. The model relies on the notions of framing, relevance, and argumentative fallacy to provide a comprehensive account of the way in which scientific news reporting can end up being fallacious even while not being false. The informal fallacy of “wrenching from context”, coupled with framing strategies which heighten the relevance of some aspects of the original scientific findings over others, appears to play a key role in common instances of semi-fake news. The model offers useful insights into the mechanisms leading to the production of misleading news and can be used in both news literacy programmes and in news reporting training and guidelines aimed at prospective science reporters. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

Our research, based on a demographic study (N = 2007) carried out in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic, used a multifactor news credibility indicator to explore how different types of sources affected the perceived credibility of a fake news item on COVID-19 in the written digital press format. We also performed a cluster analysis to determine the subgroups profiled according to key sociodemographic variables (age, gender, and education). Our results indicate that expert and political sources had a null effect on news credibility, while citizen and celebrity sources had a clear negative effect. Furthermore, our fake news story that did not cite sources was awarded a positive level of credibility. We also found that age, gender, and education level were statistically significant in their association with news credibility. © The Author(s) 2023.",

This study investigated the impact and management of mis/disinformation at university libraries in Australia through a survey of 88 library staff and interviews with 17 managers. Library staff believe they have a role in teaching skills such as critical thinking and evaluation, advocating in this space and maintaining credible, balanced and inclusive collections. Although combating mis/disinformation is a strategic priority for libraries, it is often not a priority for the institutions themselves, leading to barriers for staff who would like to devote more time and resources to teaching information literacy skills and assessing the credibility and accuracy of collections. While complaints about collection content are low and library managers’ view is that libraries should not censor materials, there is an increasing priority in Australia to address historical inaccuracies in content and build and maintain collections that are inclusive and culturally safe.

Especially amidst disruptive events and crises, news users are likely to believe that information is inaccurate or deceptive. Using an original 19-country comparative survey study across diverse regions in the world (N = 19,037), we find that news users are likely to regard information on the Russian war in Ukraine as false. They are more likely to attribute false information to deliberative deception than to a lack of access to the war area or inaccurate expert knowledge. Russian sources are substantially more likely to be blamed for falsehoods than Ukrainian or Western sources – but these attribution biases depend on a country's position on the war. Our findings reveal that people mostly believe that falsehoods are intended to deceive them, and selectively associate misinformation with the opposed camp. © 2023 The Authors.

It is an environment where objective facts have ‘become less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief’ (OED). Central here is to understand the conceptual grounding of subjective opinion as a historically specific epistemological structure of social communication. My paper will draw on the Hegelian tradition of critical theory that has in unique ways unified an analysis of the nexus between socio-economic structures and epistemological frameworks. Here I name opinion as a historically specific epistemological structure of self-certainty, which receives validation within what Adorno called the Halbbildung of industrial culture, a form of social consciousness cultivated by the spread of information and economic imperative. It will be argued that the concept of opinion becomes a vital question for understanding, in this ‘post-truth’ landscape, current standards of instantaneous communication and cultural transmission. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Our results support the integrative model in the perception of misinformation—we found strong evidence of myside bias, as pro-Russia misinformation was judged to be significantly less accurate than pro-Ukraine misinformation. Analytical thinking, measured with the seven-item cognitive reflection test, was associated with lower levels of pro-Ukraine misinformation accuracy judgments and lower overall misinformation accuracy judgments; however, there was no correlation between analytical thinking and pro-Russian misinformation accuracy judgments. Pro-Ukrainian misinformation accuracy judgments were positively related to positive emotions elicited by misinformation, the level of support for Ukraine, and the participant's age. In addition, participants indicated a higher likelihood of engaging with misinformation if they came across it online, trusted the information, and if it elicited positive emotions. Thus, our findings emphasize the role of one's attitude, analytical thinking, and emotions in one's perception, evaluation, and engagement with congruent and incongruent misinformation.

We address this question by leveraging the most comprehensive data on Trump's repetition of misleading claims during his presidency. In a national survey asking Americans to evaluate the truth of claims from this database, we find a clear partisan asymmetry. An increase in the number of repetitions of a falsehood corresponded with increased belief among Republicans but decreased belief among Democrats.

Therefore, understanding consumer behavior when they are exposed to SM fake news is important. From the perspective of information asymmetry and signaling theory, this study derives that the negative effect of fake news on consumer trust is further reinforced in the presence of information asymmetry. Conversely, vendors’ signal credibility and consumers’ perceived vendor reputation diminish the effect of SM fake news on consumer trust. Our research model is empirically validated via an online survey. The results support these three moderation effects. In addition, the results indicate that consumers’ brand bias is a direct predictor of consumer purchase behavior. The findings suggest development of strategies for marketing managers and executives to mitigate the impact of SM fake news by signaling techniques.

Two profiles of ‘fake news believers’ and two of ‘fake news non-believers’ emerged, with a high conspiracy mentality being the main marker of the former two. These two ‘fake news believers’ profiles were distinguishable: one exhibited extreme trust in the media and in politicians, and the other deep distrust.

NA,do not use this hashtag: fat acceptance (mis)information and discursive boundary-work as content moderation on instagram,"The discussions concerning the use of #fatacceptance on Instagram are important for observing both the limitations of official content moderation on social media platforms and an emerging group of users who engage in unofficial content moderation through discursive boundary-work. Discursive boundary-work takes the form of users repeatedly centering “true” or “correct” information, referencing experts and studies, and claiming the “other” is misunderstanding and misusing information or spreading (mis)information. However, these boundary-work as content moderation practices are not just about delineating between truth and falsehood; they are about users building and reinforcing norms of use, groups, relationships, and identities as well as the digital space for acceptance. Ultimately, I argue that our understandings of both content moderation and (mis)information need to be expanded and analyzed in consideration of their interplay with users’ perspectives or beliefs, collective identities, relationships with other users and groups, and larger sociocultural, political, and activist communities. © 2023 (Melissa Zimdars).

It is argued that online users turn primarily to attitude-confirming content (selective exposure effects) which amplifies existing opinions and societal polarization. However, with the increasing prevalence of online disinformation and fake news, it is also likely that people will be exposed to disinformation that contradicts their current beliefs. Regarding the controversial issue of anthropogenic climate change, we elucidate how users react when they are (incidentally) exposed to counter-attitudinal anthropogenity-denying fake news by investigating their search and selection behavior after the exposure. The innovative research design of our case study includes pre- and post-surveys, stimulus exposure, and content analyses of web activities (n = 39). Importantly, the exposure to climate-change-denying fake news decreased acceptance of climate change and its human causes. Selection behavior was mainly attitude-confirming, while search behavior was more diverse. Journalistic sources were used most often and for longest. Individual characteristics affected searches and selections. KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS In the information-saturated online environment comprising scientifically correct and incorrect information, users are frequently exposed to counter-attitudinal fake news, e.g. videos denying anthropogenic climate change. After exposure to an attitude-opposing fake news video, participants’ climate change acceptance decreased. In a free internet search after stimulus exposure, attitude-confirming anthropogenity-accepting positions and journalistic content dominated users’ selection but not search behavior. Future climate change-related communication activities should note that participants who stated they knew little about climate change knowledge were mainly interested in solution-oriented websites. The higher participants’ willingness to take personal responsibility or acknowledge others’ responsibility, the more they searched for anthropogenity-opposing content. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.37016/mr-2020-128,increasing accuracy motivations using moral reframing does not reduce republicans’ belief in false news,"In a pre-registered survey experiment with 2,009 conservative Republicans, we evaluated an intervention that framed accurate perceptions of information as consistent with a conservative political identity and conservative values (e.g., patriotism, respect for tradition, and religious purity). The intervention caused participants to report placing greater value on accuracy, and placing greater value on accuracy was correlated with successfully rating true headlines as more accurate than false headlines. Yet, the intervention had no significant direct effect on the accuracy of headline ratings. These results suggest that moral reframing, and perhaps interventions based on connecting accuracy motivation with political identity more generally, may not be promising for combatting belief in misinformation. © 2023, Harvard Kennedy School.

10.17645/mac.v11i4.7071,distrust profiles: identifying the factors that shape journalism’s credibility crisis,"Trust in news is declining globally and has been for some time a phenomenon that has been amplified in the context of a global pandemic, the rise in anti‐media populism, and social and political unrest. Overall, public trust in journalism remains low (44% globally), according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2021. Building on a growing body of research on predictors of (dis)trust among news audiences, this study examines survey data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2021 to explore distrust profiles—comparative profiles of users based on their relative distrust in news in general, news they consume, and news accessed through digital intermediaries like social and search—across distinct news environments: India, South Korea, and the US. We conclude that, across all three countries, there are large segments who either trust everything or distrust everything, suggesting a trust polarization phenomenon. Moreover, the results identify segments of swing trusters, users who trust some news and distrust other types but do not indicate a blanket tendency to trust or distrust everything. Normative expectations about the institution of journalism (i.e., folk theories) seem to be the most powerful factors in explaining the relative likelihood of membership in all profiles, where expectations regarding impartiality, concern about fake news, and fair coverage were important indicators of (dis)trust, with varying degrees depending on the media, political, and technological contexts in which they are situated. These findings suggest that to regain trust, journalists should consider how they can change people’s folk theories when it comes to news by comprehensively taking into account the unique trajectory of a given country’s media system. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

The results indicate that disinformation generates, as the primary effect, an increase in mistrust towards the media and politicians among Spanish citizens. Likewise, the incidence of disinformation in the change of opinion and the decision to vote has dropped. Concerning Coronavirus, falsehoods had a low impact on vaccination, although they promoted conspiracy theories among citizens. Men, young people and far-right sympathizers perceive the consequences of deception more intensely. Finally, the work of fact-checking agencies and legislation are the mechanisms to combat disinformation that citizens consider most reliable.

10.1007/978-3-031-15119-4_6,“enquiring minds want to know”: president bill clinton and the blurring of news and gossip,"This chapter explores the case of President Bill Clinton and the Lewinsky scandal as a pivotal moment in the convergence of political, technological, and cultural changes that elevated the presence of gossip and rumor in mainstream news sources, with major, lasting consequences. Throughout the unfolding of the scandal, unconfirmed and often salacious information about what had happened was transmitted among individuals and amplified through the media. The chapter takes a close look at some key elements contributing to such trends, including use of anonymous sourcing, heightened competition between media outlets, and the emergence of new media actors covering American politics and the presidency. An analysis of two specific incidents, involving coverage of allegations there were eyewitnesses to the president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky and that Lewinsky had a dress stained with the president’s DNA in her possession, demonstrates how prominent national news outlets publicized information reflecting weaker reporting standards and conveyed unsubstantiated rumors as news. As the news media devalued itself in cases such as this one, abandoning professional conventions and prioritizing sensational, entertaining content, the public began to no longer trust or rely on such sources to help it interpret events. We continue to see the ramifications of those developments in the present, with widespread belief in fake news, little consensus on what constitute facts or reality, and stark partisan divides about who can be relied upon to transmit the truth of political events. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
10.16888/interd.2023.40.2.20,impact of an educational intervention on the knowledge of cervical cancer prevention in nursing students and their families; [impacto de una intervención educativa en el conocimiento de la prevención de la neoplasia del cuello uterino en estudiantes de enfermería y sus familias],"A large number of factors influence the level of information that people may have regarding cervical cancer and the way to prevent it, since education is not only provided by health personnel but also by the family. When making important decisions regarding self-care, people must have effective sex education, in which protection is of vital importance, since misinformation is one of the main factors that promotes cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on the knowledge of cervical cancer prevention in a group of nursing students and their families under the Nola Pender model. The method used in the study was a quasi-experimental, non-probabilistic sample; the knowledge about cervical cancer prevention and control was evaluated before and after the intervention, using the survey validated by Dr. Dina Rubio in 2009 (with her consent). The information was included in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: the items were placed in columns and the subjects were included in the rows. Specific frequencies and absolute frequencies were calculated, the Nola Pender model was used for the analysis. The units of analysis were selected manually or randomly and these selections do not depend on probability but are generated based on the criteria of the researcher or the specific needs of the research. From a statistical point of view, information about what cervical cancer is, what it implies and how it behaves as a risk is engrained in the mental structure of the participants. To these implications of a technical and methodological nature, others of a structural and conceptual nature are added to build an integrative analysis of the results obtained in the field work. In this case, they include opinions, appraisals, judgments, and evaluations about cervical cancer. This research was organized in the following stages: (1) Evaluation of prior knowledge on cervical cancer prevention and control. The starting point of the investigation was the recognition that the participating women had a basic conceptual scaffolding, acquired through their own experience and self-training or by going to sources such as academia, social networks, specialized magazines, health institutions, medical staff and other specialists who help in the creation of an important background to consolidate an individual perspective. (2) Application of an educational intervention. In this stage, designed workshops were implemented and evaluated by the students with the advice of a teacher, and included the following topics: general concepts, signs and symptoms, associated risk factors, screening techniques, benefits, and exam precautions. The students contributed a theoretical, methodological and evaluative foundation to the design of each workshop, considering the expected training objectives, the characteristics included in its development, and a diversity of pedagogical actions that guarantee the efficiency of the transmitted message. (3) Reevaluation of the knowledge acquired. By applying a post-test, the knowledge acquired during the implementation of the workshops was recovered and resized. In this stage, the variability of the responses measured the transforming effect of the training, either by improving the knowledge acquired or by introducing new knowledge into the participant’s cognitive model. The perception that participants have about self-care practices is linked to their beliefs, denoting a favorable level of awareness and clarity, which makes it possible for the application of cytology to recognize the frequency of use, regularity over time, and attention to the results. In conclusion, when evaluating the impact of educational intervention through the Nola Pender model, changes in knowledge were found. Results also indicate that this is an ideal model for employees in heterogeneous popu lation groups in ages, educational levels, professional training, and sexual habits, because it integrates personal experience, the environment and health practices as three elements without which it is not possible to practice self-care and the culture of intervention. © (2023), All Rights Reserved.",
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1109064,afraid but misinformed: conspiracist beliefs cancel the positive influence of fear of covid-19 on vaccination intentions - findings from a romanian sample,"Understanding the factors that make people more likely to refuse vaccination against COVID-19 is crucial in order to design public health messages efficient in increasing vaccination rates. As COVID-19 creates risks of seriously damaging health effects, fear of this disease is as a significant determinant of vaccination intentions, as indicated by past research. Nevertheless, this positive influence may be limited in people who do not consider vaccines as a solution to protect against COVID-19, especially those who hold conspiracist beliefs about the new coronavirus and, implicitly, about the newly developed vaccines. The present study examined in a cross-sectional design on a convenience sample (N = 564) the joint effect of fear of COVID-19 and conspiracist beliefs on vaccination intentions, advancing past research on their independent influences. Furthermore, we investigated and controlled the effects of perceived risk of catching COVID-19, trust in medical experts, attitude towards vaccination and socio-demographical characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and education), previously found to be associated to COVID-19 vaccination intentions. We also tested the effect of ambivalence towards vaccination, i.e., the degree to which people simultaneously hold positive and negative evaluations of this intervention, as the widespread misinformation on the new coronavirus and its vaccines may induce ambivalence on this latter issue in many people. The results showed that the positive effect of fear of COVID-19 on vaccination intentions emerged only in participants who tend not to endorse conspiracist ideas on the new coronavirus. Moreover, higher vaccine hesitancy was found in participants with higher ambivalence towards vaccination, in those who perceive the risk of being contaminated by the new coronavirus as low, and in those with more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. Vaccine ambivalence also emerged as a mediator of the negative effects of conspiracist beliefs about COVID-19 on vaccination intentions. This pattern of findings suggests the public messages emphasizing the risks of COVID-19 should also combat misinformation in order to maximize vaccine uptake. Copyright © 2023 Holman and Popușoi.",
10.1007/978-94-024-2225-2_6,the battle between the thai government and thai netizens over mis/disinformation during covid-19,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus as well as false information on the pandemic not only harmed citizens’ health but also undermined the credibility of many governments during their crisis management. In Thailand, false information on COVID-19 vaccines created anti-government sentiments and had a negative impact on public health. The Thai government tried to suppress false information by launching a centralised COVID-19 information centre. It also announced an Emergency Decree on 26 March 2020 that placed the country in lockdown. Its other measures included appointing official spokespersons and setting up a Facebook page for the Centre for the COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) to control communication of the emerging situation. The Anti-Fake News Centre, a fact checking unit under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), legitimised the government’s claims as truths during the crisis. As a result, tensions among government agencies, journalists and netizens arose. This chapter adopts an ecology approach to examine how the Thai government combatted online falsehoods during the pandemic. It explores online falsehoods through three waves of the pandemic crisis and provides an analysis of how the Thai government attempted to control communication through laws and regulations, actions by government agencies and through social media campaigns. This chapter also discusses the gap between government information and citizens’ trust regarding the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine using data collected from social listening tool Zocial Eye. This chapter illustrates the confrontation between the state and civil society in anti-falsehood policy during the pandemic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature B.V.",
10.17645/mac.v11i2.6381,vulnerability to disinformation in relation to political affiliation in north macedonia,"This study aims to analyze the relationship between political affiliation and vulnerability to disinformation in North Macedonia through the role of psychological and social constraints in shaping how individuals respond to and process information. Research has shown that politically affiliated individuals may be particularly vulnerable to disinformation in part due to confirmation bias or the tendency to accept and seek out information that is consistent with one’s preex-isting beliefs and ignore or refute information that is not. Using the quantitative method and cross‐matched data from the empirical research, the study has shown that political affiliation affects the way individuals perceive disinformation. Correspondingly, disinformation with a negative connotation from one’s affiliated political party is perceived by a lower percentage as accurate, contrary to disinformation with a negative connotation from the opposing political party, which is perceived by a higher percentage as accurate. The study also found that politically affiliated individuals are more prone to disinformation than those who are not politically affiliated. The results suggest that political affiliation plays a significant role in an individual’s vulnerability to disinformation. © 2023 by the author(s).",
10.1177/01461672231154886,on the disposition to think analytically: four distinct intuitive-analytic thinking styles,"Many measures have been developed to index intuitive versus analytic thinking. Yet it remains an open question whether people primarily vary along a single dimension or if there are genuinely different types of thinking styles. We distinguish between four distinct types of thinking styles: Actively Open-minded Thinking, Close-Minded Thinking, Preference for Intuitive Thinking, and Preference for Effortful Thinking. We discovered strong predictive validity across several outcome measures (e.g., epistemically suspect beliefs, bullshit receptivity, empathy, moral judgments), with some subscales having stronger predictive validity for some outcomes but not others. Furthermore, Actively Open-minded Thinking, in particular, strongly outperformed the Cognitive Reflection Test in predicting misperceptions about COVID-19 and the ability to discern between vaccination-related true and false news. Our results indicate that people do, in fact, differ along multiple dimensions of intuitive-analytic thinking styles and that these dimensions have consequences for understanding a wide range of beliefs and behaviors. © 2023 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",

The first goal was to determine the extent to which conspiracy theories affect how undergraduates explain and understand crises and events. For example, theories about secret government cabals controlling Iraqi citizens’ lives and other issues. The second objective is to apply COVID-19 as a case to determine the extent of the conspiratorial interpretation of the sprea)d of the virus through exposure to misinformation through social media and how social media impacted it. The study was recruited from a snowball sample of students in two universities in Baghdad. Sample size 331 (230 males and 101 females) aged 19–24. They were surveyed through phone interviews. The study applied media dependency and conspiracy theories in survey research on a snowball sample in two major public universities in Baghdad. The survey shows undergraduate students depend on conspiracies from social media, especially Facebook. Moreover, the study finds that students believe in government malfeasance. In contrast, many students believe in multiple COVID-19 conspiracies, global government conspiracies, scientific conspiracies, extraterrestrial coverups, and government conspiracies meant to cause personal harm. Finally, there was no significant difference between males and females in dependence on media or scale of conspiracy belief. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.1007/s10677-023-10382-4,is rational manipulation permissible?,"Rational manipulation is constituted by the following conditions: (i) A aims to persuade B of thesis X; (ii) A holds X to be true and rationally justifiable; (iii) A knows of the existence of evidence, argument or information Y. While Y is not itself misinformation (Y is factually correct), A suspects B might take Y as important evidence for not-X; (iv) A deliberately chooses not to mention Y to B, out of a concern that it could mislead B into believing not-X; and, (v) B has no compelling reason to expect A will avoid mentioning Y in this way. A’s behavior is rational insofar as A aims to use reasons to persuade B to believe a thesis that A holds as true and justified. Yet it is manipulation because A deliberately avoids furnishing B with information that B might regard as relevant, to ensure B arrives at the correct belief. I argue that we have good reason to think that A’s action will be wrongly manipulative because it disrespects B’s consent, epistemic autonomy, and personal autonomy. That said, context is critical, and there are many times evidence is intentionally occluded that are not rational manipulation. Even so, ethical arguers should beware of ambiguous contexts, such as when there are conflicting expectations about argumentation roles and goals. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1155280,the role of self-efficacy beliefs in dealing with misinformation among adolescents,"The present study aims to understand the processes involved in misinformation among adolescents by examining the role of self-efficacy beliefs in dealing with misleading news. Specifically, we argue that the perceived capability to analyze and reflect critically on the reliability of online information sources should be stayed with the perceived self-regulatory capability to resist online social pressures to share unverifiable news. Moreover, we posited that specific online self-efficacies beliefs can be promoted by the capabilities related to regulating emotions and reflecting on new problems. In a sample of 273, we tested a path analysis model. The results attest that self-efficacy beliefs in dealing with online misinformation refer to specific capabilities: an active one, related to checking the sources of the news in order to validate their content, and an inhibitory one, related to the capability to refrain from sharing the news that seems unreliable. Moreover, self-efficacy beliefs in self-control during online interaction spreading misleading news are supported by cognitive reflective capability and self-efficacy in regulating negative emotion. The relationship between active self-efficacy related to fact-checking and sharing misleading news is not significant. The role of regulation in sharing misinformation during activated online dynamics is discussed. Copyright © 2023 Paciello, Corbelli and D’Errico.",
10.1037/xge0001374,tribalism and tribulations: the social costs of not sharing fake news,"Fake news can foster political polarization, foment division between groups, and encourage malicious behavior. Misinformation has cast doubt on the integrity of democratic elections, downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19, and increased vaccine hesitancy. Given the leading role that online groups play in the dissemination of fake news, in this research we examined how group-level factors contribute to sharing misinformation. By unobtrusively tracking interactions among 51,537 Twitter user dyads longitudinally over two time periods (n= 103,074), we found that group members who did not conform to the behavior of other group members by sharing fake news were subjected to reduced social interaction over time.We augmented this unique, ecologically valid behavioral data with another digital field study (N= 178,411) and five experiments to disentangle some of the causal mechanisms driving the observed effects. We found that social costs were higher for not sharing fake news versus other content, that specific types of deviant group members faced the greatest social costs, and that social costs explained fake news sharing above and beyond partisan identity and subjective accuracy assessments. Overall, our work illuminates the role of conformity pressure as a critical antecedent of the spread of misinformation © 2023, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. All rights reserved",

However, using panel survey data, we find that positive perceptions toward “doing your own research” are associated with holding more misperceptions about COVID-19 and less trust in science over time. Support for “doing your own research” may be an expression of anti-expert attitudes rather than reflecting beliefs about the importance of cautious information consumption. © 2023, Harvard Kennedy School.

10.3389/fsoc.2023.1150753,disinformation a problem for democracy: profiling and risks of consensus manipulation,"The aims of this article is to analyze in the post-pandemic era of technological wars how platformisation and the opacity that characterizes it can generate manipulative effects on the dynamics of consensus building. We are now in the era of the self-informative program; the hierarchical dimension of sources has vanished in parallel to the collapse of the authority, credibility, and trustworthiness of classical sources. Now, the user creates his own informative program, which gives rise to a new relationship between digital individuals. With this framework in mind, I intend to analyze the narrative of this post-pandemic phase proposed by mainstream media, using the tool of the fake news hexagon, to verify the impact and spread of fake news through social networks where emotionalism, hate speech, and polarization are accentuated. In fact, the definition of the fake news hexagon was the starting point to study through a predefined method the dynamics of proliferation of fake news to activate correct identification and blocking tools, in line with what is defined in the Digital Transformation Institute's manifesto.1 Platforms drive the process of identity construction within containers that adapt to the demands of individuals, leading toward a flattening out of results from web searches as these follow the principle of confirmation bias. We assist to an increasing lack of recognition of the other, the individual moves away from commitment, sacrifice, and achieving a higher collective good. It becomes quite evident how, in the face of the collapse of authority, as this new dimension takes hold, the understanding of reality and the construction of public identity can no longer be the result of the ability to decipher messages alone.

10.1177/00187208231173263,"who gets caught in the web of lies?: understanding susceptibility to phishing emails, fake news headlines, and scam text messages","Objective: The present study investigated if the same users are vulnerable to phishing emails, scam text messages, and fake news headlines and if there are universal predictors of susceptibility for all three tasks. Background: Theoretical research provides support for the notion that the same users likely fall for multiple forms of online deception. However, no research has directly compared susceptibility for various online deceptions (eg phishing, disinformation, scam text messages) within the same group of users. Method: Participants completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions, the Cognitive Reflection Test (ie impulsivity), and the Digital Literacy Scale, and classified 90 legitimate and deceptive emails, text messages, and news headlines. Results: Results suggest that individuals who struggle to discriminate between deceptive and legitimate stimuli on one task experience similar difficulties on the other two tasks. Additionally, while lower levels of digital literacy and cognitive reflectiveness predicted poorer discrimination abilities across all three tasks, age did not predict performance. Interestingly, participants appeared to be the most susceptible to phishing emails. Conclusion: Overall, individuals who fall for one form of online deception appear to be more likely to fall for other forms of deception, and digital literacy and cognitive reflectiveness can predict widespread vulnerability to online deception. Application: Organizations may be able to identify potential vulnerabilities for a variety of online attacks by measuring digital literacy, cognitive reflectiveness, and performance in one online deception task. Additionally, training interventions may be the most needed for phishing emails. © 2023, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",

We surveyed Iowa agricultural landowners to (1) identify their experiences and beliefs regarding wetlands as a conservation practice and (2) identify barriers and opportunities to landowners in engaging in wetland conservation. We analyze if respondents are likely to conserve or restore wetlands and identify motivating factors for action or inaction. A lack of experience with and misinformation about wetlands, coupled with a lack of access to needed conservation knowledge networks, limits conservation action for women landowners, no matter their age cohort. We identify strategies for improving outreach and knowledge access among these landowners.

10.1177/13675494231173536,simple solutions to wicked problems: cultivating true believers of anti-vaccine conspiracies during the covid-19 pandemic,"The pandemic has produced an abundance of medical misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Many of these narratives appear impervious to scientific evidence and indifferent to the authority of the state. This has resulted in ‘true believers’ being cast as paranoid and irrational. In this article, we take a different approach by exploring the cultural appeal of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Drawing on qualitative analysis of two leading figures of the anti-vaccination movement – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola – we demonstrate how these influencers establish authority by staging indignation against a corrupt scientific establishment and positioning themselves as Truthers offering simple solutions to complex (wicked) problems. By conceptualising what we refer to as the Truther Playbook, we examine how anti-vaccine Truthers capitalise on existing grievances and conditions of low institutional trust to further solidify people’s troubled relationship with institutional expertise while drawing attention to the structural conditions and social inequalities that facilitate belief in conspiracy theories. We contend that conspiracy theories offer not only offer alternative facts and narratives but are predicated on identification and in-group membership, highlighting the limits of debunking as a strategy to tackle disinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.",

However, these studies have generally considered only brief delays between misinformation exposure and correction, and do not explore processing style as a potential moderator of correction timing. We conducted a two-wave online experiment randomly assigning participants to receive corrections either shortly after exposure or approximately one week later.

Specifically, it examines whether author credentials, writing style, and verification check flagging influence participants’ intent to follow article behavioral recommendations provided by the article, perceived article credibility, and sharing intent. Findings suggest that users rely only on verification checks (passing/failing) in assessing information credibility.

Numerous cognitive and socio-cognitive factors underlie misinformation reliance and the continued influence effect. Cognitive factors include limitations in memory capacity as well as memory updating and knowledge revision capabilities; socio-cognitive factors include biassed reasoning and perceived source credibility. Although misinformation is not a new problem, social media and instant messaging platforms have dramatically changed the information transmission environment, with their unregulated and user-controlled nature increasing the ease with which misinformation can be created and propagated. Drawing insights from cognitive, social and political psychology, the current chapter provides a general overview of the cognitive and social factors underlying (1) misinformation belief, and (2) the continued influence effect of corrected misinformation. The discussion focuses on how the unique nature of online information acquisition, specifically characteristics of both open and closed online communication networks, not only creates an environment ideal for the spread of misinformation, but functions to inhibit accurate knowledge revision. The chapter concludes by providing specific recommendations for how to effectively mitigate the spread of misinformation within the online information ecosystem. The concepts and recommendations discussed in this chapter are broadly applicable regardless of social or cultural context. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature B.V.",

Attempts to slow the spread of misinformation by platforms such as Facebook and Twitter include adding fact-checking labels to social media posts, the effectiveness of which remains unclear. Using two experiments, we tested the credibility effects of fact-checking labels (confirmed vs. disputed) on graphical presentations of political (Democrat vs. Republican) quotes and social media news posts. Study 1 (N = 312) tested the effects of these labels on political social media posts with political quotes, and Study 2 (N = 356) replicated and extended this research to a news story post about a politician. Results indicate that the valence of verification labels on their own do not affect perceptions of the content. Instead, users find corrections of opposite-party political figures more credible and are more willing to share content when it negatively portrays opposite-party political figures. These results demonstrate potential limitations of fact-checking labels and highlight the importance of considering political ideology in correcting misinformation on social media sites. © 2023 SAGE Publications.",

We investigate the effects of two aspects related to the dissemination and modality of digital disinformation: (In)authentic references to the ordinary people as sources of disinformation and the multimodal embedding of deceptive content. Using a pre-registered experiment in the United States and India (N = 1008), we found that adding decontextualized visuals to disinformation on climate change did not amplify its effects on credibility or user engagement. Mimicking ordinary citizen cues has a stronger effect than using an alternative hyper-partisan media source to communicate disinformation under certain conditions. Low levels of media trust and preferences for information from the vox populi moderate the effects of citizen-initiated disinformation, suggesting that disenchanted citizens who oppose established information may be most vulnerable to disinformation attacks from social bots or trolls. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.1177/00332941231164073,state mindfulness and misinformation susceptibility,"Two experiments examined whether brief mindful meditation exercises and belief in task utility impacted memory in the misinformation paradigm. Participants watched a fictionalized crime video, received post-event misinformation about the video, and completed a cued recall memory test. They were randomly assigned to complete either a brief mindfulness exercise or unrelated task prior to encoding the video (E1) or prior to the final cued recall test (E2). Further, half of the participants in each group were informed that their assigned task was beneficial to memory performance. In Experiment 1, information about task benefits reduced misinformation reports on the final recall test, regardless of the task. The brief mindfulness exercise increased self-reported mindfulness scores in both experiments. While no group differences in memory were found, correlational analyses across the two experiments suggest that individuals who achieve more intense states of mindfulness may have lower susceptibility to misinformation and better event memory when meditation occurs prior to encoding. The results suggest that brief mindfulness exercises can reliably increase state experiences of mindfulness and have potential for use as experimental manipulations. However, the intensity of a self-guided mindfulness experience can vary across individuals, so it is important to consider individual differences when considering the application of the exercises. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.1016/j.cresp.2023.100111,a moth to a flame? fulfilling connectedness needs through romantic relationships protects conspiracy theorists against covid-19 misinformation,"Conspiracy theorists’ unpopular opinions likely make them more apprehensive about interactions with others, frustrating their need to belong. Therefore, they may be susceptible to believing misinformation because evidence that others share their beliefs provides “social proof” that they can expect interactions with others to be positive and rewarding. The present research examined whether alternatively fulfilling the need for social connection through romantic relationships could protect conspiracy theorists against COVID-19 misinformation. In a 3-week daily diary study (N = 555), experimental participants implicitly learned to associate their romantic partners with positive experiences (by repeatedly pairing their partner with highly positive and approachable stimuli, McNulty et al., 2017). We then assessed how much participants trusted individuals they might normally distrust, as a manipulation check, and how much participants tuned their daily personal beliefs and behavior to match the U.S. public's daily susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. Participants high on conspiratorial thinking trusted fellow community members more in the experimental than control condition. Participants high on conspiratorial thinking in the experimental condition were also less likely to treat the U.S. public's greater daily susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation as proof that they could discount the virus. The present findings suggest that rewarding romantic connections might be leveraged to limit conspiracy theorists’ susceptibility to believing public skepticism about COVID-19. © 2023 The Authors",
10.1080/01402382.2023.2211836,analysing the political effects of ‘fake news’ deflections in the uk,"Empirical reports point to the increasing weaponisation of the ‘fake news’ label–or unwarranted fake news accusations–by politicians. They see this as a discursive tool used by politicians to deflect critical reporting, delegitimise media outlets and achieve other political ends, suggesting that abuse of such deflections can benefit these political actors. Theoretically, ‘fake news’ deflections in the face of emergent derogatory information may benefit politicians by allowing them to maintain the support and trust of citizens as well as reduce belief in the accusation–as long as the deceit is not exposed. To evaluate this hypothesis, a survey experiment (n = 1,420) was conducted, varying how British PM Boris Johnson responded to two separate damaging accusations. This enabled the assessment of the impact of the ensuing fake news deflections on UK citizens’ belief in the accusation and also their opinion of the politician. Results show that employing fake news deflections reduces the respondents’ belief in the accusation, increases support for the politician, and generally increases perceptions of his truthfulness. However, when the deflection is revealed to be false and the politician’s deceit is exposed, citizens will revise their belief in the story, as well as punish the politician by significantly reducing their perception of his truthfulness and their support for him. Thus, while fake news deflections of emergent derogatory information are likely to reduce a citizen’s belief in these allegations and muster political support, rampant abuse of fake news deflections may ultimately erode citizens’ trust and support for the politician. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We employ a two-dimensional perspective on political knowledge and investigate how factual political knowledge, confidence in that knowledge, and misinformation, understood as the mismatch between factual political knowledge and confidence in knowledge, are related to social media news consumption. While earlier studies have suggested a negative relationship between social media news consumption and factual knowledge, there are indications that social media use may give people a general sense of being informed, even when they are not. Such general subjective knowledge might, however, differ from confidence in retrieved facts. Drawing on a two-wave panel study from Norway, we find evidence of a negative relationship between social media news consumption and both dimensions of knowledge. Notably, however, we do not find that social media news use leads to confidence in incorrect beliefs, suggesting that the digital media environment produces an uninformed, but not an overconfident, misinformed news audience. © Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

This article reveals that not all skepticism is “healthy” skepticism by theorizing, measuring, and testing the effects of two types of skepticism toward social media misinformation: accuracy- and identity-motivated skepticism. A two-wave panel survey experiment shows that when people’s skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by accuracy motivations, they are less likely to believe in congruent misinformation later encountered. They also consume more mainstream media, which in turn reinforces accuracy-motivated skepticism. In contrast, when skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by identity motivations, people not only fall for congruent misinformation later encountered, but also disregard platform interventions that flag a post as false. Moreover, they are more likely to see social media misinformation as favoring opponents and intentionally avoid news on social media, both of which form a vicious cycle of fueling more identity-motivated skepticism. © The Author(s) 2023.",
10.3389/fcomm.2023.1231301,science journalism in pandemic times: perspectives on the science-media relationship from covid-19 researchers in southern europe,"Several studies have investigated the relationship between scientists and journalists. However, Southern Europe has been less studied when it comes to understanding the nature and effectiveness of collaborations between these two groups of professionals. To address this gap, this study focused on researchers (i.e., academics and scientists from different fields, including clinical researchers and medical doctors) who conducted research activities on COVID-19-related topics in three Southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Using an approach that combined survey data (n = 317) with semi-structured interviews (n = 40), we explored researchers' personal beliefs, opinions, and experiences regarding their encounters with the media during the pandemic. Our results show that researchers' motivations, concerns, and benefits in their interactions with the media remained largely unchanged during the pandemic. Despite the additional challenges posed by the health emergency, most researchers in Italy, Portugal, and Spain rated their interactions with journalists positively. Several practices to promote and maintain trustful and fruitful cooperation with journalists were also identified. Additionally, lessons learned were extracted from the interactions between researchers and journalists during the pandemic. They hold particular relevance in a context of uncertainty, fake news, high demand for information and high expectations in science and technology. These findings aim to support both the scientific community and media professionals to deal with current and future communicative challenges such as health, environmental and social crises that require joint efforts from multiple societal actors.

Such an institute would provide a media-friendly source of information and perspective from experts totally immersed in the relevant subject matters. They would debunk false charges, but also reframe the discussion to reveal disinformers’ records of lies as well as the quirks of human belief that make many people susceptible to false claims. Government can play an essential role in uncovering the secret machinations of hostile state actors, but typically chooses spokespersons who are managers rather than subject matter experts. Not only do they lack in-depth knowledge of often obscure subjects, but also lack the autonomy to freely discuss highly controversial subjects. Nongovernmental expert spokespersons would suffer neither deficiency. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1007/978-3-031-10971-3_19,disinformation and diplomacy,"Disinformation impacts three elements of diplomacy. On the political level, it weakens trust between partners by eroding credibility. In the absence of a common ethical framework, propaganda practices and disinformation further anti-diplomatic behavior. On the multilateral level, disinformation erodes consensus, freedom of expression, and the normative power of states. Finally, disinformation causes the diplomatic corps to abandon its traditional discretion and forces it to discuss matters in public and on social media. This shift from the private to the public makes diplomatic culture uncomfortable. There is no simple solution to the problem of disinformation because it operates with emotions, not facts or arguments. The challenge for diplomats is twofold. They must be able to discern the difference between noise and signals. And they must regain social trust by providing truthful information and consensus narratives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
10.1177/14614448231172964,misinformation rules!? could “group rules” reduce misinformation in online personal messaging?,"Personal messaging platforms are hugely popular and often implicated in the spread of misinformation. We explore an unexamined practice on them: when users create “group rules” to prevent misinformation entering everyday interactions. Our data are a subset of in-depth interviews with 33 participants in a larger program of longitudinal qualitative fieldwork (N = 102) we conducted over 16 months. Participants could also donate examples of misinformation via our customized smartphone application. We find that some participants created group rules to mitigate what they saw as messaging’s harmful affordances. In the context of personalized trust relationships, these affordances were perceived as making it likely that misinformation would harm social ties. Rules reduce the vulnerability and can stimulate metacommunication that, over time, fosters norms of collective reflection and epistemic vigilance, although the impact differs subtly according to group size and membership. Subject to further exploration, group rulemaking could reduce the spread of online misinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.",

We conducted a laboratory experiment based on game theory, using a modified version of the ultimatum game, where proposers had the opportunity to manipulate the responder’s beliefs by the use of ‘hide behind the small cake’ strategy. Our results contradict the selfish rationality model predictions. Intermediary financial incentives led people to adopt extremes strategies of pure fair/selfish allocation. Greater levels of financial incentive reduced the full expropriation strategy and at the same time, reduced the presence of fair offers, which suggests an interesting interaction between opportunism and psychological costs of lying. The results showed that opportunism is hugely context-dependent and people will update their decision regarding opportunism in accordance with the financial size incentive. Thus, the same person can behave differently depending on the financial value involved and will not necessarily be more selfish when the financial amount increases. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

10.1080/09658211.2023.2216910,preference for cheap-and-easy memory verification strategies is strongest among people with high memory distrust,"When choosing strategies for verifying one’s memory, people are more influenced by the perceived cost of using a strategy than by its likelihood of yielding reliable information (i.e., cheap-strategy bias). The current preregistered study investigated whether people with high memory distrust are less likely to exhibit this bias than their low memory distrust counterparts. Participants (N = 535) imagined a scenario in which they witnessed an accident and were then led by friends to question their memories about the accident. Participants had to propose five strategies for verifying that particular memory. Following this, they rated each strategy’s cost, reliability, and their likelihood of using it, as well as completing two validated measures of trait memory distrust. Contrary to our prediction, compared with participants with low memory distrust, participants with higher memory distrust exhibited a larger cheap-strategy bias. Follow-up analyses suggested that compared with memory-trusters, memory distrusters’ strategy choices were more influenced by a strategy’s perceived cost, and less influenced by its perceived reliability. Our results suggest that people who are more skeptical about their memories may be more cynical about the worthwhileness of verifying their memory, which could make them especially susceptible to misinformation acceptance and false memory creation. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.1007/s12144-023-04464-w,are accuracy discernment and sharing of covid-19 misinformation associated with older age and lower neurocognitive functioning?,"The online proliferation of COVID-19 misinformation led to adverse health and societal consequences. This study investigated possible differences in COVID-19 headline accuracy discernment and online sharing of COVID-19 misinformation between older and younger adults, as well as the role of individual differences in global cognition, health literacy and verbal IQ. Fifty-two younger (18–35 years old) and fifty older adults (age 50 and older) completed a neurocognitive battery, health literacy and numeracy measures, and self-report questionnaires via telephone. Participants also completed a social media headline-sharing experiment (Pennycook et al., Psychological science, 31(7), 770–780, 2020) in which they were presented with true and false COVID-19 headlines about which they indicated: 1) the likelihood that they would share the story on social media; and 2) the factual accuracy of the story. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance controlling for gender and race/ethnicity showed no effects of age (p =.099) but a significant interaction between actual COVID-19 headline accuracy and the likelihood of sharing (p <.001), such that accuracy was more strongly related to sharing false headlines (r = −.64) versus true headlines (r = −.43). Moreover, a higher likelihood of sharing false COVID-19 headlines was associated with lower verbal IQ and numeracy skills in older adults (rs = −.51--.40) and with lower verbal IQ, numeracy, and global cognition in younger adults (rs = −.66--.60). Findings indicate that headline accuracy judgements, numeracy, and verbal IQ are important contributors to sharing COVID-19 misinformation in both older and younger adults.

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1172094,the moderating influence of perceived government information transparency on covid-19 pandemic information adoption on social media systems,"Introduction: Social media systems are instrumental in the dissemination of timely COVID-19 pandemic information to the general population and contribute to the fight against the pandemic and waves of disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses the information adoption model (IAM) as the theoretical framework to examine the moderating influence of perceived government information transparency on the adoption of COVID-19 pandemic information on social media systems from the Ghanaian perspective. Government information transparency regarding the pandemic is crucial since any lack of transparency can negatively affect the global response to the pandemic by destroying trust (in government and public health authorities/institutions), intensifying fears, and causing destructive behaviors. Methods: It applies a convenient sampling technique to collect the responses from 516 participants by using self-administrated questionnaires. The data analysis was computed and analyzed with SPSS-22. The following statistical tests were conducted to test the hypotheses: descriptive statistics, scale reliability test, Pearson bivariate correlation, multiple linear regressions, hierarchical regression, and slope analysis. Results: The results indicate that information quality, information credibility, and information usefulness are significant drivers of COVID-19 pandemic information adoption on social media systems. Furthermore, the perceived government information transparency positively moderates the influence of information quality, information credibility, and information usefulness on the adoption of COVID-19 pandemic information on social media systems. Conclusion: The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings suggest the utilization of social media systems as an effective tool to support the continued fight against the current COVID-19 pandemic and its future role in national and global public health emergencies.

This study examined how media coverage, myths, political leaders, and community leaders influence the attitudes and misconceptions about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination uptake in the Mississippi Delta region. This qualitative study employed focus group discussions (FDGs) with representatives from three rural counties in the Mississippi Delta. A thematic analysis approach was used for data analysis. Participants were aware of how COVID-19 is transmitted, the preventative measures that can be used to mitigate the spread of the virus, and misconceptions and beliefs that lingered in their communities. Participants were uncertain about the need for the COVID-19 vaccine in terms of perceived risks (e.g., side effects, efficacy, and safety) and its novelty. Participants also discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation that resulted in distress and distrust of the vaccine and health behavior recommendations. There are varying misconceptions and beliefs about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine among communities in the rural Mississippi Delta. Thus, multi-sectoral collaborations between agencies that can use risk communication frameworks to deliver accurate health information that can resolve misinformation about COVID-19 in rural communities are needed. © 2023 Taylor &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0026; Francis Group, LLC.",

This study focuses on using Twitter as a data collection and analysis tool to understand the narrative surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in the days after the first emergency-use authorization (EUA). We conducted a content analysis of tweets we collected over a 30-day period (n = 419,495) and developed an iterative codebook that contained six domains (tweet source, location, tweet characteristics, COVID-19 specific topics, demographic descriptors, and sentiment) and thirty-six codes. Despite the abundance of misinformation on Twitter about the vaccine, we found that more tweets were positive than negative in tone and contained mostly reliable and up-to-date information about the vaccine. Most tweets came from individuals though many came from organizations. We found little discussion of demographic descriptors such as race/ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, nor did we see discussion of misinformation or mask-wearing. Additionally, few tweets came from politicians or political organizations, and we found little talk of politics. This article contributes to the growing body of evidence of using Twitter to understand the narrative surrounding health topics during public health crises such as COVID-19. © 2023 Atlantic Journal of Communication.",
10.1515/commun-2022-0020,crisis alert: (dis)information selection and sharing in the covid-19 pandemic,"High levels of threat and uncertainty characterize the onset of societal crises. Here, people are exposed to conflicting information in the media, including disinformation. Because individuals often base their news selection on pre-existing attitudes, the present study aims to examine selective exposure effects in the face of a crisis, and identify right-wing ideological, trust-, and science-related beliefs that might influence the selection and sharing of disinformation. A representative survey of German internet users (N = 1101) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak showed a confirmation bias in crisis-related news selection and sharing. It revealed right-wing authoritarianism and political mistrust as significant predictors of disinformation selection. The influence of social dominance orientation, mistrust in politics, and perceived certainty of knowledge were significant for sharing disinformation. The present results extend previous knowledge about people's (dis)information behavior in times of crisis, and shed light on groups particularly vulnerable to disinformation.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2023.",

Analyzing the link of digital skills achieved by students, applied in collaborative teaching methods, we established the existing relationship between information literacy (IL) and reciprocal teaching (RT) skills in Communication Sciences students; based on the classification of IL competencies in DigComp 2.1, related to skills and attitudes promoted by RT. Method: the research was anonymized, a digital questionnaire was used with 100 IL questions and 22 RT questions, both with a Likert scale with values of 0-9; the reliability of the instrument was validated by Cronbach’s Alpha with values of .987 for AI and .992 for RT, as well as the review at the discretion of 3 experts. Results: the data showed a non-normal distribution, applying Spearman’s Rho it was determined that there is a significant relationship, establishing through Multinomial Logistic Regression that the IL of level N3 predominates, concentrating 90% of cases, reflected in the 2/3 of RT concentrated in levels Low-Medium, the regression coefficients show that the low development of IL does not lead to an advanced RT. Conclusions: In Peru, the development of Digital Competencies, fundamentally the 3 dimensions of IL (navigate, evaluate and manage information), is similar to Spain, being that, evaluating it must have greater development to ensure that communicators can combat fake news, a level N3 would be insufficient, a review of the university curriculum and improving student training would be needed to achieve it, because being “digital natives” is not enough. © 2022 University of Granada.

Unfortunately, they have also become channels for fake news. But if fake news spreads through chat groups, it begets the question if corrections also be effectively disseminated in the same way. Guided by the frameworks of social identity theory and social presence theory, this study examined the impact of source familiarity (familiar versus unfamiliar) and mode of delivery (interpersonal chat versus group chat) on the perceived credibility of a correction message to debunk misinformation sent on WhatsApp. Through a five-day-long experiment involving 114 student participants in Singapore, this study found no main effect of either source familiarity or mode of delivery on the perceived credibility of the correction message. However, the study found a significant interaction effect—when the correction was sent to a chat group, members rated it as more credible when it was sent by a familiar source than when it was sent by a source they had never met. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature B.V.",

Despite the ubiquity of visual media and the growing scholarly attention to misinformation, there is a relative dearth of research on visual misinformation. It remains unclear which specific visual formats (e.g., memes, visualizations) and features (e.g., color, human faces) contribute to visual misinformation's influence, either on their own or in combination with non-visual features and heuristics, and through what mechanisms. In response to these gaps, we identify a theoretical framework that explains the persuasive mechanisms and pathways of visual features in lending credibility (e.g., as arguments, heuristics, and attention determinants). We propose a list of relevant visual attributes to credibility perceptions and a research agenda that integrates methods including computational visual analysis, crowdsourced annotations, and experiments to advance our understanding of visual misinformation. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

While misinformation spreads across cultural, sociolinguistic, and geo-political contexts, it impacts communities differently according to preexisting power structures and information resources. Through focus groups with Vietnamese Americans across two generations and several geographic locations, we explore the complexities of misinformation within one such immigrant community. Findings highlight how a prevalence of intergenerational divides in political information seeking, lasting historical and political traumas of immigration, and language barriers underpin the saliency and impact of misinformation for Vietnamese Americans. Further, we explore how misinformation impacts political engagement, highlighting the consequences of misinformation at a familial and community-level. This research highlights the need for researchers of misinformation to better attend to the inequities of informational access and the vulnerabilities of already marginalized communities as targets of problematic information and information disorder. © Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Research suggests that multiplist epistemic beliefs may be maladaptive and lead to a radically subjective view of science. Little is known about the association between such beliefs and mistrust in science/scientists and the tendency to believe in misinformation. The aims of this study were to examine: (a) the degree to which multiplist epistemic beliefs about science are associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and science-related conspiracy beliefs, (b) the degree to which trust in science mediates the association between multiplist epistemic beliefs about science and conspiracy beliefs, and (c) the extent to which COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and science-related conspiracy beliefs are associated with compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Participants were 210 undergraduate students attending a Hispanic-serving institution located in a large city in the southern U.S. Path analysis results indicated that multiplist epistemic beliefs about science were positively associated with science-related conspiracy beliefs after accounting for fundamentalism and conservatism. Moreover, trust in science mediated the positive association between multiplist epistemic beliefs about science and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Finally, belief in COVID-19 conspiracies was negatively associated with COVID-19 prevention guideline compliance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

It examines the relationships between messages sent in high- and low-compliance states, between state compliance levels and tendencies in public attitudes, and between messages sent and resident decisions about COVID-19 compliance. We analyzed press release messages from governors of five states with high immigrant populations and surveyed the public in these states to examine compliance rates regarding COVID-19 protective actions. Findings illustrate that perceived source credibility is critical to behavioral compliance regardless of message content adherence and that political ideology may become a competing narrative and may influence resident decisions. © 2023 National Communication Association.",

Reasons are multifactorial and include social and structural determinants of health. During the onset and height of the pandemic, evidence suggested decreased access to SARS CoV-2 testing. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx)- Underserved Populations initiative to improve SARS CoV-2 testing in underserved communities. In this study, we explored attitudes, experiences, and barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and vaccination among New York City public housing residents. Methods Between December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted 9 virtual focus groups among 36 low-income minority residents living in New York City public housing. Results Among residents reporting a prior SARS CoV-2 test, main reasons for testing were to prepare for a medical procedure or because of a high-risk exposure. Barriers to testing included fear of discomfort from the nasal swab, fear of exposure to COVID-19 while traveling to get tested, concerns about the consequences of testing positive and the belief that testing was not necessary. Residents reported a mistrust of information sources and the health care system in general; they depended more on “word of mouth” for information. The major barrier to vaccination was lack of trust in vaccine safety. Residents endorsed more convenient testing, onsite testing at residential buildings, and home self-test kits. Residents also emphasized the need for language-concordant information sharing and for information to come from “people who look like [them] and come from the same background as [them]”. Conclusions Barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and vaccination centered on themes of a lack of accurate information, fear, mistrust, safety, and convenience. Resident-endorsed strategies to increase testing include making testing easier to access either through home or onsite testing locations. Education and information sharing by trusted members of the community are important tools to combat misinformation and build trust. © 2023 Izeogu et al.

10.17645/mac.v11i2.6301,the (un)intended consequences of emphasizing the threats of mis-and disinformation,"The mis‐ and disinformation order does not only consist of the dissemination of deceptive content but also involves using fake news as a blame‐shifting label in politics and society. The salience of this label on social media and in political dis-course, and the frequent discussions held about the threats of fake news in public opinion, may result in a systematic overestimation of mis‐ and disinformation’s presence. Even more so, these primed perceptions about false information may affect people’s evaluations of factually accurate information. In this article, we offer a theoretical account of how the public’s and media’s attention to mis‐ and disinformation, fake news labels, and the threats of mis‐ and disinformation may have a negative impact on people’s trust in factually accurate information and authentic news. In addition, relying on an experimental case study of pre‐bunking interventions, we illustrate the extent to which tools intended to increase media literacy in the face of mis‐ and disinformation may also have ramifications for trust in reliable information. Based on this, we propose a forward‐looking perspective and recommendations on how interventions can circumvent unintended consequences of flagging false information. © 2023 by the author(s);.",

Using a probability sample (n = 825), we examine these factors in tandem across four political claims concerning US presidential elections and the COVID-19 pandemic. We find Democrats and Republicans differ in their belief in true and false claims, with each party believing more in pro-attitudinal claims than in counter-attitudinal claims. These results are especially pronounced for affectively polarized partisans. We also find interactions between partisanship and platform use where Republicans who use Google or Twitter are more likely to believe in false claims about COVID-19 than Republicans who do not use these platforms. Our findings highlight that Americans’ beliefs in political claims are associated with their political identity through both partisanship and polarization, and the use of search and social platforms appears critical to these relationships. These findings have implications for understanding why realities are malleable to voter preferences in liberal democracies. © The Author(s) 2023.",

The same goes for the news. People are shifting from traditional mass media to digital news platforms and getting news through websites, news portals, social media, etc. If you are dependent on the Internet for every kind of information, then you will face false information on the Internet. False or fake news is defined as any information that does not have any credible and reliable source behind it or any misleading information that is likely to mislead the public. The aim behind fake news transmission is to damage a person's or entity's reputation or advertising revenue. If you want not to fall into the fake news you should know about fake news detection and media literacy. The main purpose of the study is to check the exposure of fake news awareness and fake news detection methods among social media users. In the current scenario, this is much necessary to know that social media users have the advisable knowledge of fake news detection and media literacy because people easily fall into the rumors. Mob lynching is one of the biggest rumors on the Indian Internet. In this research, the survey method and questionnaire for data collection were used. The questionnaire was distributed randomly over different social media platforms and emails to the intended respondents. The findings obtained reveal that most fake or false news in India is transmitted through WhatsApp, but social media users have adequate knowledge of fake news and media literacy. © Pandey B., Kumar G., Algavi L.O., Kumar M., Sharma V., 2023.",

Results showed that the IP location of the information poster does influence users’ judgments of the authenticity of the information and that the consistency between users’ long‐term residence and poster IP is not important for users to make judgments about the credibility of information. The high level of usage of Weibo also has no effect on users’ judgment of the credibility of the information, and this may be related to the small difference in college students’ overall use of Weibo. The results also showed that users’ perceptions of information’s accuracy, logical coherence, absence of bias, alignment with their own views, consistency with the majority opinion, and trustworthiness of its source are all statistically positively correlated with the overall credibility of information. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

To address this question, this study examines not only how well (or poorly) individuals discern true and false news on social media, but also how contextual factors in news presentation and individual’s cognitive and motivational tendencies might shape the patterns of their beliefs in and likelihood to engage online news. We conducted an online survey experiment on a sample of Chinese social media users recruited from a national panel (N = 481). The results show that, first, people generally perceived social media news as accurate and were better at correctly identifying truthful news than false news, revealing both a truth bias and a veracity effect. Second, social endorsement cue and news content slant could affect how individuals judge the veracity of a news post and engage it online. Third, evidence was mixed on how individuals’ deliberative thinking propensity and epistemic motive operated. While our primary goal is to present evidence from a non-Western society to shed lights on the psychology of false news on social media, we also strive toward teasing out some implications specific to the China context. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1017/epi.2023.25,knowledge and disinformation,"This paper develops a novel account of the nature of disinformation that challenges several widely spread theoretical assumptions, such as that disinformation is a species of information, a species of misinformation, essentially false or misleading, essentially intended/aimed/having the function of generating false beliefs in/misleading hearers. The paper defends a view of disinformation as ignorance generating content: on this account, X is disinformation in a context C iff X is a content unit communicated at C that has a disposition to generate ignorance at C in normal conditions. I also offer a taxonomy of disinformation, and a view of what it is for a signal to constitute disinformation for a particular agent in a particular context. The account, if correct, carries high stakes upshots, both theoretically and practically: disinformation tracking will need to go well beyond mere fact checking.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We analyzed 4,165 spell-checked English tweets with a link to 1 of 20 matched COVID-19 news stories (10 true and 10 fake), across the world during 1 year, via computational linguistics and advanced statistics. Tweets with common words, negative emotional valence, higher arousal, greater dominance, first person singular pronouns, third person pronouns or by users with more followers were more likely to be true news tweets. By contrast, tweets with second person pronouns, bald starts, or hedges were more likely to be fake news tweets. Accuracy (F1 score) was 95%. While some tweet attributes for detecting fake news might be universal (pronouns, politeness, followers), others might be topic specific (common words, emotions, hedges). © 2023 SAGE Publications.",
10.3758/s13428-023-02153-x,the (mis)information game: a social media simulator,"Given the potential negative impact reliance on misinformation can have, substantial effort has gone into understanding the factors that influence misinformation belief and propagation. However, despite the rise of social media often being cited as a fundamental driver of misinformation exposure and false beliefs, how people process misinformation on social media platforms has been under-investigated. This is partially due to a lack of adaptable and ecologically valid social media testing paradigms, resulting in an over-reliance on survey software and questionnaire-based measures. To provide researchers with a flexible tool to investigate the processing and sharing of misinformation on social media, this paper presents The Misinformation Game—an easily adaptable, open-source online testing platform that simulates key characteristics of social media. Researchers can customize posts (e.g., headlines, images), source information (e.g., handles, avatars, credibility), and engagement information (e.g., a post’s number of likes and dislikes). The platform allows a range of response options for participants (like, share, dislike, flag) and supports comments. The simulator can also present posts on individual pages or in a scrollable feed, and can provide customized dynamic feedback to participants via changes to their follower count and credibility score, based on how they interact with each post. Notably, no specific programming skills are required to create studies using the simulator. Here, we outline the key features of the simulator and provide a non-technical guide for use by researchers. We also present results from two validation studies.

As information is posted without any kind of verification of its veracity, fake news has become a problem of great influence in our information driven society. Thus, to mitigate the consequences of fake news and its propagation, automated approaches to detect malicious content were created. This paper proposes an effective framework that utilizes only the text features of the news. We evaluate several features for differentiating fake from real news and we identify the best performing feature set that maximizes performance, using feature selection techniques. Text representation features were also explored as a potential solution. Additionally, the most popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models were tested to conclude to the model that achieves the maximum accuracy. Our findings reveal that a combination of linguistic features and text-based word vector representations through ensemble methods can predict fake news with high accuracy. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperformed all other models, while linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved comparable results. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

The current study directly replicated this paper, addressing methodological weaknesses including increasing the sample size fivefold and preregistering detailed analysis plans. Participants (N = 123) completed a survey and two interviews where they discussed real and fabricated childhood events, based on information provided by an older relative. We replicated the findings of the original study, coding 35% of participants as reporting a false memory for getting lost in a mall in childhood (compared to 25% in the original study). In an extension, we found that participants self-reported high rates of memories and beliefs for the fabricated event. Mock jurors were also highly likely to believe the fabricated event had occurred and that the participant was truly remembering the event, supporting the conclusions of the original study. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

Two studies were conducted (N1 = 264 and N2 = 113) using both correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) designs. The results show a positive relationship between the perception of a lack of transparencies in the context of pandemic policies (Study 1), general lack of transparency in the decision-making process (Study 2), and belief in conspiracy theories about the emergence of the COVID-19 virus and vaccines’ related fake news. This effect was mediated by a general conspiracy mentality. That is, people who evaluated policies as non-transparent presented a higher conspiracy mentality, and this, in turn, was related to belief in specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Inoculation theory has shown to be a promising vehicle to effectively neutralise the influence of misinformation on adults in various contexts. However, possible applications of inoculation theory for climate change education with young people have not been looked at yet. In this study, we investigated whether Austrian adolescents can be “inoculated” against misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change. In a quantitative randomised online survey experiment (N = 1066) based on the study of van der Linden et al. (Global Challenges 1(2):1600008, 2017), we demonstrated that adolescents are susceptible to presented misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change, even in the presence of accurate information. However, it is possible to pre-emptively protect adolescents against such misinformation through attitudinal inoculation. Furthermore, the inoculation treatment led to not only an increase in the adolescents’ consensus estimate but also their belief certainty in their estimate increased. We recommend future climate change education research to further elaborate possible applications of inoculation theory in climate change education or when teaching other supposedly socially controversial topics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

As a result, detecting and flagging fake news has become a critical task for social media platforms to ensure a safe environment for advertisers. Few studies have examined how fake news labeling influences the evaluation of a brand whose ad is inadvertently placed alongside fake news. We conducted three experiments using different types of fake news articles and ad stimuli to test fact-checking labeling effects. Study 1 employed a 2 (labeling vs. no labeling) x 2 (content-ad association high vs. low) between-subjects factorial design with a fake news story, disguised as real news, related to a product recall. The study findings revealed that a news story labeled as false hurts the evaluations of the adjoining ad and its brand by undermining the credibility of the story. This credibility spillover effect is moderated by the level of association between the story and the ad. Study 2 found that the same ads used in Study 1 received significantly more positive ad evaluations when they were presented in a positive non-fake news article. To determine whether the effects of labeling would be replicated in non-negative fake news, Study 3 was conducted. Even in non-negative fake news, when fact-check labeling was presented, the placed ad and its brand received significantly negative evaluations. © 2023 Western Social Science Association.",

10.1080/21670811.2023.2200196,the role of trust and attitudes toward democracy in the dissemination of disinformation—a comparative analysis of six democracies,"Trust lies at the heart of the disinformation crisis, as citizens must decide which narratives to follow and whether to accept “alternative truths.” Therefore, trust in institutions that publish reliable information can act as a shield against disinformation. This comparative study investigates the role of trust in news media and political actors and general attitudes toward democracy in the willingness to spread disinformation (i.e., likes, shares, or comments). Findings of this study show that news media trust plays a subordinate role but that trust in social media news has a strong relationship with willingness to spread disinformation. In 2020, citizens in the United States and United Kingdom who had high trust in their governments were more willing to spread disinformation, whereas in France and Belgium, citizens who trusted opposition leaders were more likely to do so. Moreover, citizens who were satisfied with democracy appeared to be less vulnerable to disinformation, with the exception of those in the United States. Therefore, political actors bear great responsibility for the current (dis)information crisis because they can exploit citizens’ trust to their advantage. © 2023 The Author(s).

In the present study, 155 4- to 7-year-olds participated in a staged event and discussed the event with knowledgeable or misled parents prior to a formal interview. The impact of parental bias and child age on parent–child conversations and in children’s formal reports were assessed. Young children with misled parents were the least accurate during parent–child conversations. Although recall of the event during formal interviews contained few inaccuracies, misinformation and facilitation effects emerged in children’s recognition memory. Children demonstrated limited recall for the content of parent–child conversations and infrequently attributed parents as the origin of misinformation. The findings indicate that postevent discussions with misled parents increase the risk of false reports.

10.1111/gove.12808,fueling conspiracy beliefs: political conservatism and the backlash against covid-19 containment policies,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, people have witnessed a deluge of conspiracy theories and disinformation. As the coronavirus poses a significant threat to individuals' lives, these conspiracy theories are dangerous, as they erode public trust and undermine government efforts to fight the virus. This paper examines the political determinants of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Particularly, we analyze how government policy responses to the pandemic and individuals' ideological predispositions interact to shape people's tendencies to believe conspiracy theories. Using survey data from 22 advanced industrial countries, we show that political conservatives are more prone to conspiracy beliefs than liberals. More importantly, this tendency is reinforced when the government adopts stringent containment policies. Our results suggest that governments' policy efforts to contain the coronavirus can trigger an unintended backlash from political conservatives. This study has important implications for the behavioral and attitudinal effects of government containment policies that are often overlooked. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1175571,the role of conspiracy mindset in reducing support for child vaccination for covid-19 in the united states,"Introduction: We have previously proposed and tested a model that predicts reluctance to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the US from embrace of a conspiracy mindset that distrusts the federal health agencies of the US government and regards their intentions as malevolent. In this study, we tested the model’s ability to predict adult support for COVID vaccination of children ages 5–11 after the vaccine was approved for this age group. Methods: Relying on a national panel that was established in April 2021 (N = 1941) and followed until March of 2022, we examined the relation between conspiratorial thinking measured at baseline and belief in misinformation and conspiracies about COVID vaccines, trust in various health authorities, perceived risk of COVID to children, and belief in conspiracy theories about the pandemic’s origin and impact. In addition, we tested a structural equation model (SEM) in which conspiracy mindset predicted adult support for childhood vaccination for COVID in January and March of 2022 as well as the adults own vaccination status and their willingness to recommend vaccinating children against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Results: The model accounted for 76% of the variance in support for childhood vaccination for COVID-19; the relation between the mindset and support for vaccination was entirely mediated by baseline assessments of misinformation, trust, risk, and acceptance of pandemic conspiracy theories. Discussion: The SEM replicated the prior test of the model, indicating that a conspiracy mindset present among at least 17% of the panel underlies their resistance to vaccinate both themselves and children. Efforts to counteract the mindset will likely require the intervention of trusted spokespersons who can overcome the skepticism inherent in conspiratorial thinking about the government and its health-related agencies’ recommendations for a particular vaccine.

10.1080/13504630.2023.2207460,"covid-19, communalism, and islamophobia: india facing the disease","As threats to human security, epidemics cause fear and anxiety, thus generating conspiracy theories, fake news, and discrimination. In 2020, the most widespread xenophobic reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic was Sinophobia. In comparison, India’s response to the pandemic was both conventional and exceptional. Like other countries, India recorded a surge in Sinophobia; but –remarkably– in Islamophobia too. Turning to both history and theory, this paper investigates how Coronavirus got transformed into a ‘Muslim disease’ and connected to narratives of holy war and Islamization (‘Corona Jihad’). We contextualize the 2020 Covid-related Islamophobic wave within a longer process of demonization of the Muslim that is catalysed by the beliefs and policies of Hindu nationalism. In light of Muslims’ continuing relegation to the fringe of the Indian body-politic, we propose an interpretation of the 2020 disease-induced Islamophobia as scapegoating, based on René Girard’s mimetic theory. In conclusion, the case of Covid-19 in India confirms that in divided societies collective threats like epidemics are likely to exacerbate already existing forms of discrimination rooted in the society’s mainstream memory and norms, and highlights the role of beliefs in mediating between threat and violence. This case study also highlights the deep penetration of communal discourse in India’s everydayness and its far-reaching implications. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, its relevance has been called into question due to its controversy and ambigu-ity. We have compiled herein 30 definitions from selected dictionaries, academic papers, news agencies, influential media observatories, and independent, certified fact‐checkers over the last six years and have carried out a manual relational content analysis on them. We also collected data from four bibliometric studies from academic literature and five surveys on how the general public perceived fake news. In keeping with this three‐level systematic review (lexicography, bibliometrics, and public perception) we detected some trends, including a growing drift towards a post‐truth‐driven conceptualization of fake news. Results also show that the “viral” and “memetic” quality of a rumor prevail over the demonstrable credibility of a source and even the factuality of a reported event; the element of surprise or outrage in the heat of the moment is more powerful than the ironic detachment elicited by news satire and parody; and sharing motivations are definitely less concerned with perceived accuracy than with partisan support, community sentiment, emotional contagion, and a taste for the sensational or bizarre. © 2023 by the author(s).",
10.1007/s11218-023-09777-z,addressing racial misinformation at school: a psycho-social intervention aimed at reducing ethnic moral disengagement in adolescents,"The present study aims to examine whether by promoting the socio-analytic thinking it is possible to intervene in the reliance on ethnic moral disengagement as a negative consequence of racial misleading news, that can seriously contribute to the diffusion of ethnic prejudice. We focus on the neglected phenomenon of racial hoaxes, which can be defined as misleading news stories dealing with health or safety threats, in which the protagonist is described in terms of ethnicity or nationality. The intervention procedure has been created starting from the well-established literature focused on media biases’ reflection, integrated with the recent studies on ‘mediated intergroup contact’ where the observation of the person belonging to the outgroup is crucial for prejudice reduction. The intervention involved 83 adolescents (Mage = 13.9; SDage = 0.9) and it was composed of two different parts, one focused on the analytical racial hoax reading, and the other focused on racial hoax rewriting after the ‘mediated contact’, represented by an alternative story given by the African protagonist. The results show that in dealing with misleading news, the promotion of this social-analytic processing reduces ethnic biases of moral disengagement. In particular, it was found that analytical processes are supported by the participants’ level of propensity for analytical reasoning and that these processes directly hinder distorted ethnic beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that improving social-analytic processes related to reflexivity could be an effective intervention to counter those distorted beliefs, such as ethnic disengagement beliefs, associated with discrimination and racial prejudice. © 2023, The Author(s).",

Based on a sample of 529 US and Canadian adults, two types of behaviors were assessed (i.e., vaccination status and subsequent booster willingness) using models based on two common COVID-19 conspiracy belief types (hoax and government). Overall, conspiracy beliefs predicted most factors of the TPB and HBM. Perceived susceptibility was a consistent mediator regardless of conspiracy type or outcome variable.

Journalism has a fundamental mission as a shield against this problem and as a creator of truthful news and content, but for this it needs to maintain credibility among society, which is very inclined to doubt traditional media. This article investigates the perception that professional journalists have about the influence of these two phenomena -disinformation and hoaxes-, as well as content verification mechanisms -fact checking- in the performance of the journalistic profession and its future evolution. The procedure chosen for data collection consisted of 20 interviews with journalists who currently practice the profession in Spain, with the aim of offering us a panoramic view of the actions of journalism against disinformation and fake news, as well as what their relationship with the audience. The results show a positive and firm attitude of the profession to fight against false news, claiming its professionalism, valuing the verification of the contents and the role of trusted information sources, and a critical vision in which it is put the focus on the need for both the media and viewers to put more effort and interest in being well informed.

However, there is much that we do not know about the relationship between the subject matter and timing of content produced by the two types of publishers. By analyzing the content of several million unique articles published over 28 months, we show that high- and low-credibility publishers operate in distinct news ecosystems. Bursts of news coverage generated by the two types of publishers tend to cover different subject matter at different times, even though fluctuations in their overall news production tend to be highly correlated. Regardless of the mechanism, temporally convergent coverage among low-credibility publishers has troubling implications for American news consumers. © The Author(s) 2023.",

Against the backdrop of online news cognitive processing, interventions against misinformation, and inquiry-based learning, we designed, conducted, and evaluated a pilot online news literacy training with 36 elementary school students from Germany. In a causal comparison, quantitative data from N = 29 students attest high participant acceptance and substantial effects of the inquiry-based training on participants' ability to correctly assess online news credibility, and on the corresponding cognitive processing route, moving this from intuitive to analytic processing. Despite the small sample, the experiment was only underpowered regarding the between-subject effect, whereas the power was sufficient for all other effects. These encouraging findings of the pilot training may be the result of knowledge reorganization associated with inquiry-based learning.

Nevertheless, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, about 120 nm in diameter, remains invisible to people whose cognition, emotions, and health-related behaviors are driven primarily by the subjective perception of the virus. Mass media communicating information, symbols, beliefs, and codes of conduct to the population contribute widely to the socially constructed representations of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, the aim of the current research is to investigate the impacts of the common COVID-19 mass media image of the ""ball with spikes""representing the SARS-CoV-2 virus on older adults particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease and fake news dissemination. This research is based on an innovative mixed-methods research design that combines questionnaires (N = 144), semi-structured research interviews, and pictographic measures (N = 26). The primary results demonstrate that individuals' perceptions of and emotional reactions to the invisible SARS-CoV-2 virus are shaped by mass media exposure, as the ""ball with spikes""became a familiar symbol of the COVID-19 virus, marked by the symbolism of dangerousness and mystery with a divisive aesthetic. The current research that aims to highlight the role of mass media as the vector of an icon image of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus provides additional elements that may contribute to improved crisis management effectiveness of future pandemic outbreaks.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",

The belief in misinformation leads to poor judgment, decision making, and even to unnecessary loss of life. The ability of misinformation to spread through social media may worsen the harms of different emergencies, and fighting it is therefore critical. In this work, we analyzed the discussion of misinformation related to monkeypox on Twitter by training different classifiers that differentiate between tweets that spread and tweets that counter misinformation. We collected over 1.4M tweets related to the discussion of monkeypox on Twitter from over 500K users and calculated word and sentence embeddings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. We trained multiple machine learning classification models and fine-tuned a Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model on a set of 3K hand-labeled tweets. We found that the fine-tuned RoBERTa model provided superior results and used it to classify the complete dataset into three categories, namely misinformation, counter misinformation and neutral. We analyzed the behavioral patterns and domains that were used in misinformation and counter misinformation tweets. The findings provide insights into the scale of misinformation within the discussion on monkeypox and the behavior of tweets and users that spread and counter misinformation over time. In addition, the findings allow us to derive policy recommendations to address misinformation in social media. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

Given the relatively limited prevalence of misinformation in people’s news diets, this study explores if the heightened salience of misinformation as a persistent societal threat can have an unintended spillover effect by decreasing the credibility of factually accurate news. Using an experimental design (N = 1305), we test whether credibility ratings of factually accurate news are subject to exposure to misinformation, corrective information, misinformation warnings, and news media literacy (NML) interventions relativizing the misinformation threat. Findings suggest that efforts like warning about the threat of misinformation can prime general distrust in authentic news, hinting toward a deception bias in the context of fear of misinformation being salient. Next, the successfulness of NML interventions is not straight forward if it comes to avoiding that the salience of misinformation distorts people’s creditability accuracy. We conclude that the threats of the misinformation order may not just be remedied by fighting false information, but also by reestablishing trust in legitimate news. © 2023 The Author(s).

The pandemic of Covid-19 influenced the media organisations in their working processes significantly and a decrease in accuracy was one of the findings of our study. This paper examines the impact of the pandemic in local media to journalists’ practices and the role of the media. We aimed to research the effects of the pandemic in the local environment on journalistic procedures and the media's role after this period. In answering the research questions, we used the method of a structured questionnaire for journalists and semi-structured in-depth interviews for local News Editors. We aimed to research the media production practices on various levels of professionals included in local news. We detected those production practices that could endanger the credibility of the local media. The findings provided insights into how Slovenian local journalists and editors define, understand, and practice fact-checking. The results led to an understanding that the perception of the media role in offering information was higher during the pandemic period and that human verification is key in ensuring the credibility of content in local newsrooms. © 2023 The Author(s).

10.17645/mac.v11i2.6628,"pre‐truth: fake news, semiological guerrilla warfare, and some other media and communication “revolutions”","In this article, I will work on the idea of Pre‐Truth (as opposed to post‐truth) and Semiological Guerrilla (as opposed to fake news), claiming that these two concepts are better equipped to explain what is happening in our contemporary societies, especially if we take into account the world of media and communication. In the first part of the article, I will frame the problems of fake news and post‐truth within the dynamics characterizing the relationships between knowledge and power. Taking into account Foucault and Latour’s perspectives, I argue that the problem of fake news can be understood as a new kind of relationship between these two instances, previously stably coupled and in the hands of institutional power. Later, I will deal with three different meanings of “fake news,” that are usually blended and confused: (a) serendipity, (b) false belief, and (c) mendacity. Consequently, I will deal with the problem of “Semiological Guerrilla Warfare,” arguing that the new shape of the “knowledge‐power relationship” rendered alternative and non‐institutionally certified interpretations the norm. Eventually, I will identify the deep cause of this effect in the machinic production of documents provided by new technologies, causing a return of the medieval sense of “truth” as “trust,” independent from knowledge and strictly related to anecdotes and personal experiences. Finally, I will work on the concept of “truth” connected to technology, trying to reveal its genealogy with the aim of explaining some misleading contemporary beliefs on “post‐truth.”. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",

At the same time, a separate but similar line of work has raised concerns that these platforms are the primary vector of political misinformation. Despite the renewed focus on misinformation studies, the question as to whether political knowledge and susceptibility to misinformation are related remains open. If they are indeed related, we still know little about the underlying cognitive mechanisms that drive political learning when people rely on social media for news. Based on a two-wave panel survey collected during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we found that social media news use fosters the news-finds-me perception (particularly among those who feel overwhelmed with the volume of information available on social media). This, in turn, leads people to be both uninformed and misinformed about politics and current affairs. Implications for democracy are discussed. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1108/GKMC-08-2022-0190,an exploration of perceptions and use of misinformation on the social web in oman,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate individuals’ perceptions and behavior when dealing with misinformation on social media platforms. While misinformation is not a new phenomenon, the COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated its spread through social media outlets, leading to widespread exposure to false or misleading information. This exposure can have serious consequences on individuals’ decision-making and behavior, especially when it comes to critical decisions related to education or healthcare. The use of social media as a source of information makes it essential to understand how people perceive and respond to misinformation to develop effective strategies for mitigating its harmful effects. Design/methodology/approach: This large-scale study explores the Omani individuals’ perceptions and behaviour of misinformation on the social Web in a series of studies that seek to enhance the authorities’ response to misinformation. The study adopted a quantitative approach to collect data. Using WhatsApp as a social networking platform, a survey was disseminated to capture participants’ perceptions and behaviour among different segments of citizens in Oman. Findings: The findings showed that Omani participants have high verification skills, implying high information literacy skills among them. Additionally, results indicated that misinformation had created doubt and anxiety among the participants. Moreover, it hindered many participants’ ability to take countermeasures and obtain reliable data. Originality/value: This study was a large-scale study conducted in Oman, making it one of a few studies conducted in the region about perceptions and behaviour towards misinformation. The findings help to understand how different cultures interacted with COVID-19 misinformation. In addition, these findings offer useful insight that can help health information professionals to design preventive resources that help people to obtain accurate information during crises. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",
10.1037/xge0001381,truth sensitivity and partisan bias in responses to misinformation,"Misinformation represents one of the greatest challenges for the functioning of societies in the information age. Drawing on a signal-detection framework, the current research investigated two distinct aspects of misinformation susceptibility: truth sensitivity, conceptualized as accurate discrimination between true and false information, and partisan bias, conceptualized as lower acceptance threshold for ideology-congruent information compared to ideology-incongruent information. Four preregistered experiments (n= 2,423) examined (a) truth sensitivity and partisan bias in veracity judgments and decisions to share information and (b) determinants and correlates of truth sensitivity and partisan bias in responses to misinformation. Although participants were able to distinguish between true and false information to a considerable extent, sharing decisions were largely unaffected by actual information veracity. A strong partisan bias emerged for both veracity judgments and sharing decisions, with partisan bias being unrelated to the overall degree of truth sensitivity. While truth sensitivity increased as a function of cognitive reflection during encoding, partisan bias increased as a function of subjective confidence. Truth sensitivity and partisan bias were both associated with misinformation susceptibility, but partisan bias was a stronger and more reliable predictor of misinformation susceptibility than truth sensitivity.

10.1080/20445911.2023.2241699,the influence of involvement and emotional valence on accuracy judgments and sharing intention of fake news,"Recent studies proposed that emotional valence of news affected individuals’ beliefs in fake news. However, the results across various studies remain controversial. Involvement probably have an influence on beliefs in fake news. To understand whether involvement modulates the role of different valences of fake news, we designed two experiments. Both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 were 2 (valence: positive, negative) *2 (involvement: high, low) within-subject designs. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the interaction between involvement and emotional valence on accuracy judgment was significant. The results indicated that the role of emotional valence in the accuracy judgment of fake news was affected by involvement, which provided evidence to explain the contradictory results for the role of valence on fake news beliefs. Experiment 2 found the main effect of involvement and emotional valence on sharing intention, indicating that the sharing intention of fake news was regulated by involvement and emotional valence respectively. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.17645/mac.v11i1.6098,how politicians’ attacks on science communication influence public perceptions of journalists and scientists,"In today’s “post‐truth” world, concerns over political attacks on the legitimacy of expert knowledge and scientific facts are growing. Especially populist politicians frequently use their social media platforms to target science and journalism, arguing these are part of an “evil elite,” deliberately misleading the public by spreading disinformation. While this type of discourse is highly concerning, thus far, we lack empirical evidence on how these accusations affect the public perceptions of scientists and journalists. To fill this gap, this study tests how politicians’ attacks affect citizens’ trust in journalists and scientists and the information provided by them. Furthermore, it investigates whether this discourse renders hostility towards journalists and scientists acceptable and whether there are effects on the image of politicians using such anti‐science rhetoric. Findings suggest that the effects of politicians’ attacks on citizens’ perceptions of scientists and journalists are limited. Only individuals with strong anti‐elitist attitudes are susceptible to disinformation accusations and indicate less belief in discred-ited scientific information. Interestingly, these individuals also perceive politicians using such attacks as more trustworthy and authentic. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).",
10.3389/fnins.2022.1037659,effect of doctor–patient news-induced moral judgments on pain empathy for doctors and patients in china,"Objective: Pain empathy’s preferential nature tends to trigger prejudice and intergroup conflicts. Given the current degree of proliferation of doctor–patient conflict news in China, this study aims to determine whether readers of doctor–patient news-initiated moral judgments prefer pain empathy for doctors or patients. Materials and methods: This study utilized localized doctor–patient news with high or low moral performance (based on morality ratings of patients’ behaviors) as moral-judgment-eliciting materials, and painful pictures as pain empathy-eliciting materials. The event-related potential (ERP) technique was utilized to assess moral judgment’s effect on the cognitive empathy component and to investigate electroencephalogram signals’ accuracy in classifying four brain response patterns when facing doctor or patient is experiencing or not experiencing pain. Results: Under low moral text material, participants exhibited smaller mean wave amplitude of positive 300 (P3) and late positive potential (LPP) to painful pictures than non-painful pictures when facing patients; under high moral text material, participants exhibited larger mean wave amplitude of P3 and LPP to painful pictures than non-painful pictures when facing doctors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals’ classification accuracy was significant in 0–1,000 ms in both high and low moral judgments, but the classification accuracy was higher in low moral judgments in some cognitive empathy stages (0.51, 0.53–0.55, 0.66–0.79, and 0.88–1 s). Conclusion: Under low moral judgment, individuals pay less attention to the patient’s (perpetrator’s) pain; under high moral judgment, individuals empathize with the doctor (the person praised), showing that news-induced moral judgment can sway readers’ empathy for different social groups. In cognitive empathy, individuals’ brain representations are more discriminatory under low than high moral judgments when confronted with pain by doctors and patients, which provides insight into objectively recognizing group bias.

10.1007/978-3-031-08608-3_6,"postpandemic technopolitical democracy: algorithmic nations, data sovereignty, digital rights, and data cooperatives","COVID-19 has hit citizens dramatically during 2020, not only creating a general risk-driven environment encompassing a wide array of economic vulnerabilities but also exposing them to pervasive digital risks, such as biosurveillance, misinformation, and e-democracy algorithmic threats. Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives. This chapter elucidates that in the absence of coordinated and interdependent strategies to claim digital rights and data sovereignty by algorithmic nations, on the one hand, big tech data-opolies and, on the other hand, the GDPR led by the European Commission might bound (negatively) and expand (positively) respectively, algorithmic nations’ capacity to mitigate the negative side effects of the algorithmic disruption in Western democracies. © 2023, The Author(s).",
10.1037/xap0000394,warning weakens retrieval-enhanced suggestibility only when it is given shortly after misinformation: the critical importance of timing,"Recalling details from an experienced event can sometimes exacerbate eyewitnesses' susceptibility to subsequent misinformation. This finding, known as retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES), can be eliminated when participants are warned about possible inaccuracies in the misinformation source (Thomas et al., 2010). In three experiments, we investigated whether this warning benefit persists across delays. When the warning was issued shortly after participants were exposed to misinformation, it inoculated participant witnesses against RES, regardless of whether the final memory test occurred immediately or 48 hr after the warning. However, the warning lost its effectiveness when it was delivered 48 hr after participants were exposed to misinformation. These results applied to both recognition memory and the confidence-accuracy relationship. We considered these data from the perspective of temporal distinctiveness, and we argue that a warning serves a similar function to a forget cue in the directed forgetting paradigm.

Method. Online questionnaire completed by 26 teens, ages 15 to 19 years, living in Brooklyn, New York, in June 2020. Responses include quantitative data (ranking and checklists) and qualitative data (free writing). Analysis. The questionnaire explored information themes in relation to COVID-19, such as information sources and platforms, credibility and disinformation, teens’ roles in information intermediation, affective aspects of their information behaviour, as well as what would have helped teens find COVID-19 information. Results. Teens experienced anxiety as they looked for reliable information about COVID-19. They served as their family’s language brokers and technology experts, taking on the responsibilities of information intermediator. Teens used social media platforms and legacy media as information sources. Nevertheless, teens indicated a wish for institutional support and guidance from governments (municipal, state, federal) and schools. Libraries were not an information source. Conclusions. The results of this study have implications for research into teen mental health in relation to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as well as reframing the meaning of ‘everyday life information seeking’ during a time of crisis, when everyday life is not normal. © 2022, University of Boras.

10.1007/s11191-021-00306-y,socioscientific issues thinking and action in the midst of science-in-the-making,"Like all SSI, the COVID-19 pandemic requires decisions that are contentious, involve scientific thinking, and vary across social groups. This investigation determined how perceptions about COVID-19 science and sociocultural membership associate with 557 university biology students’: (1) COVID-19 behaviors after stay-at-home orders and (2) support for future societal COVID-19 responses. Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses demonstrate that students’ COVID-19 mitigating actions after stay-at-home orders were significantly and positively associated with, in order of importance: (1) higher levels of COVID-19 spread prevention knowledge; (2) espousing more liberal, as opposed to conservative, political orientations; (3) being female; and (4) increased disbelief of COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation claims. Furthermore, the students’ political orientation moderated the relationship between their trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decisions and their personal COVID-19 actions, with trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making being a significant positive predictor of moderate, conservative, and very conservative student groups’ COVID-19 mitigating actions. Conversely, there was no association between trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making and very liberal and liberal students’ conducting COVID-19 actions. Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses revealed that students’ support for societal-wide COVID-19 mitigating measures going forward is positively associated with, in order of importance: (1) espousing more liberal, as opposed to conservative, political orientations; (2) higher levels of COVID-19 spread prevention knowledge; (3) increased disbelief of COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation claims; (4) trust in scientific models for guiding COVID-19 decision-making; and (5) beliefs that factors beyond science and technology (e.g., personal actions) are necessary for pandemic resolution. Implications discussed include the importance for helping students analyze how sociocultural membership, personal biases, and trust in science interactively influence socioscientific decision-making. Further recommendations discussed include how science communication strategies must account for sociocultural variance in order to optimize trust in science and reasoned and responsible action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

10.1371/journal.pone.0275534,promoting engagement with quality communication in social media,"The COVID-19 pandemic made explicit the issues of communicating science in an information ecosystem dominated by social media platforms. One of the fundamental communication challenges of our time is to provide the public with reliable content and contrast misinformation. This paper investigates how social media can become an effective channel to promote engagement and (re)build trust. To measure the social response to quality communication, we conducted an experimental study to test a set of science communication recommendations on Facebook and Twitter. The experiment involved communication practitioners and social media managers from select countries in Europe, applying and testing such recommendations for five months. Here we analyse their feedback in terms of adoption and show that some differences emerge across platforms, topics, and recommendation categories. To evaluate these recommendations’ effect on users, we measure their response to quality content, finding that the median engagement is generally higher, especially on Twitter. The results indicate that quality communication strategies may elicit positive feedback on social media. A data-driven and co-designed approach in developing counter-strategies is thus promising in tackling misinformation. Copyright: © 2022 Cinelli et al.",

Journalists were challenged to report on an outbreak of pressing health-related information, complicated by malinformation erupting in a time of enhanced public demand for reliable facts. This study uses in-depth interviews with journalists at leading news outlets- both public service and commercial, in Italy, Spain, and Bulgaria (N = 24) to examine how they responded to misinformation and disinformation arising in the initial months of the pandemic. Using the frameworks of journalistic epistemology and the hierarchy-of-influences model, we explored the norms, routines, and practices guiding journalists’ truth claims as well as the individual, routine, organizational, and social-systems influences shaping their decision-making. We found three common narratives of conspiracy theories consistent across different media systems: “big state” concerns, evident in people questioning the very existence of the coronavirus as a pretense for globally enforced state supervision on individual freedoms; “big pharma,” or people blaming the lack of a cure for COVID-19 on pharmaceutical companies pushing for vaccinations; and “big fear” attitude - falsehoods about vaccines potentially causing more harm than good, including changing people’s DNA. We also discuss three common strategies journalists used to respond to COVID-misinformation: deflecting, countering and false equivalency approach. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

In order to achieve efficient communication, it is necessary to plan the material in a way that reaches levels of semiotic pertinence, which privilege the perception of meaning and enable holistic knowledge about the recipients’ culture, as in “Human-Centered Design” (HCD). In this context, this paper presents the case study on the development of the EU4ALL project, co-founded by the EP, which is being developed by a Portuguese cooperative and aims to create strategies to communicate the 10 democratic values highlighted by the European Parliament, in a way that is more accessible to communities in situations of information vulnerability, specifically to people serving time in prison and living in social housing. For this, the Double Diamond design model was used, involving a literature review about democratic values, research synthesis, validation sessions with Portuguese Euro Deputies (MEPs), creation of communication materials, testing with users and finally the delivery of the materials and realization of sensitization sessions with vulnerable groups. Therefore, it was possible to verify the validity of the approaches used, which explored the levels of semiotic pertinence, establishing strategic and efficient communication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
NA,communicating medical content now and then: fact or fiction?,"This research paper draws on a selection in progress of corpora of medical content covering two different periods in Portuguese contexts. It aims at accounting for pragmalinguistic and discursive strategies in use in disseminating medical content in early modern and contemporary times in and beyond expert discourse communities. It departs from the on- going analysis of sections of (i) Rodrigo de Castro's (1617) original treatise on gynaecology under translation process into Portuguese and English (cf. Gynecia research project 2019- 2022), originally written in the language of communication in science and medicine in the early modern period, that is Latin; (ii) along with corpora in Portuguese collected by Nunes (2020) of (pseudo)medicinal and (pseudo)scientific content, retrieved from publications available on the websites Vamos Lá Portugal and Lusojornal2015. These are labelled as producers of fake news by other Portuguese print dailies, such as Diário de Notícias (cf. Pena, 2018). A contrastive, exploratory, and cross- period analysis is undertaken, supported by a corpusbased approach. The analysis comprises narrative sequences in treatises (Labov, 1997) and testimonial passages (Maingueneau, 2004), of which Castro's treatise offers but some evidence on first- and third- person reference, which are reported to contribute to some of the communicative features (Sousa, 2019) to bridge the gap between the ""doctor- patient communication dyad, its functions in the healing process"" (Boguslawska- Tafelska, 2020). This stance has been particularly contended from a holistic and ecolinguistic perspective (Charon, 2005) with renewed relevance in the production and dissemination of medical content (Boguslawska- Tafelska, 2019) as part of authors'/ speakers' persuasive and emotional involvement with health issues for centuries. In other words, popular science, experiential knowledge, popular beliefs, and traditions seem to be interwoven unevenly with sound scientific medical content (Sousa, 2019). There is evidence of a shifting pronoun reference, i.e., a plurality of voices (Sousa & Correia, 2014): the citizen/ layperson, the learned person, and the researcher/ expert in the field. The underlying persuasive force between story and discourse (Culler, 1981) which reinforces the reliability of the corpora of the so- called fake news is linked to testimony (also explicit in Castro's treatise), to emotion (pathos), followed by the reference to sound scholars'/ researchers' statements (ethos), all of which intended to involve the audience, for instance via proximization strategies (Kopytowska, 2013, 2018, 2020). © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2022.

Using Moral Foundations Theory, this study compared the moral narratives underlying polarized views about e-cigarette use and regulation. We integrated computational and human strategies by conducting the Chow test on the time series data and classification, topic modeling, and Chi-square tests on posts (N = 2,669) from 26 pro-vaping and 19 anti-vaping Facebook Pages. The observation period (August 1, 2019 to March 5, 2020) encompassed the outbreak of “e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury” (EVALI), deaths and subsequent legislation. Results revealed that pro-vaping posts were more likely than anti-vaping posts to mention Fairness/cheating and Authority/subversion, involving a conspiracy belief in an “e-cigarettes vs. Big Tobacco” rivalry, while anti-vaping posts were more likely to mention Sanctity/degradation. There were no significant differences between pro-vaping and anti-vaping posts in the likelihood of mentioning Care/harm or Loyalty/betrayal. Nevertheless, according to the topic modeling results, the use of moral foundations varied between pro-vaping and anti-vaping narratives, with the meanings of Care/harm and Loyalty/betrayal dependent on the post author’s group affiliation. Health interventions can tailor persuasive messages to different moral values and debunk misinformation about public health policies to mitigate the vaping epidemic.

10.1093/joc/jqac031,populist attitudes and politicians' disinformation accusations: effects on perceptions of media and politicians,"Populist politicians increasingly accuse opposing media of spreading disinformation or ""fake news.""However, empirical research on the effects of these accusations is scarce. This survey experiment (N = 1,330) shows that disinformation accusations reduce audience members' trust in the accused news outlet and perceived accuracy of the news message, while trust in the accusing politician is largely unaffected. However, only individuals with strong populist attitudes generalize disinformation accusations to the media as an institution and reduce their general media trust. The phrase ""fake news""does not amplify any of these effects. These findings suggest that politicians can undermine the credibility of journalism without much repercussion - a mechanism that might also threaten other authoritative information sources in democracies such as scientists and health authorities. © 2022 The Author(s).",

Explanations for this hesitancy have focused on misinformation about the vaccines, lack of trust in health authorities, and acceptance of conspiracy theories about the pandemic. Here we test whether those with a conspiratorial mindset, which distrusts a wide range of institutions, were poised to reject COVID vaccines before the pandemic even began. To answer that question, we reinterviewed members of a national US panel that we had previously surveyed beginning in 2018. As hypothesized, having a conspiratorial mindset in 2019 predicted COVID-vaccination hesitancy in 2021 better than prior trust in health authorities or acceptance of vaccine misinformation. Those with the mindset were also more likely to consume media that bolstered belief in pandemic conspiracies. Research is needed on the determinants of conspiratorial mindset and ways to minimize the likelihood that consequential health decisions will be influenced by it. © 2022, The Author(s).",

According to WHO, HL is pivotal in fighting infodemic effectively, and education is a vital tool for developing it. In the presented work, we analyze 247 educational materials dedicated to children, adolescents, and their carers explaining the pandemic, prepared by the Chinese, American, German, Italian and Polish governments and international non-governmental organizations. Focusing on the textual and visual side of the documents, we investigated how the pandemic is explained and what discursive measures were used to inform young citizens about the risks and consequences of pandemic restrictions. Additionally, we verified whether the materials helped developing critical thinking, which is crucial to prevent spreading fake news and conspiracy theories. Although the analyzed materials were prepared in different cultural contexts, we identified that all of them contained simple instructions on the desired behaviours during the pandemic. Key messages relating to the importance of hygienic behaviors were often supplemented with guidelines on how to successfully complete each action. While the cultural particularities in presenting the state of the pandemic are visible, the challenges of dealing with the emotional and social crises were dominant all around the world. In our study, we argue that the possibilities of building HL were not fully exploited by the national and international institutions. Citizens were taught how to behave in unusual circumstances but not why they should behave differently. The educational materials lacked reliable knowledge that would allow them to deal with infodemic and develop critical thinking. We conclude that health education expertise worldwide should be focused on enhancing individuals’ ability to make informed health decisions and provide three recommendations regarding the process of development of health educational resources for children and the youth. © 2022 Świątkiewicz-Mośny et al.

10.1371/journal.pone.0279929,an equitable vaccine delivery system: lessons from the covid-19 vaccine rollout in canada,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities and disproportionately affected vulnerable individuals and communities (e.g., low-income, precariously housed or in institutional settings, racialized, migrant, refugee, 2SLBGTQ+). Despite their higher risk of infection and sub-optimal access to healthcare, Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy focused primarily on age, as well as medical and occupational risk factors. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods constant comparative qualitative analysis of epidemiological data from a national database of COVID-19 cases and vaccine coverage in four Canadian jurisdictions. Jurisdictional policies, policy updates, and associated press releases were collected from government websites, and qualitative data were collected through 34 semi-structured interviews of key informants from nine Canadian jurisdictions. Interviews were coded and analyzed for themes and patterns. Results COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out in Canada in three phases, each accompanied by specific challenges. Vaccine delivery systems typically featured large-venue mass immunization sites that presented a variety of barriers for those from vulnerable communities. The engagement and targeted outreach that featured in the later phases were driven predominantly by the efforts of community organizations and primary care providers, with limited support from provincial governments. Conclusions While COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Canada is largely considered a success, such an interpretation is shaped by the metrics chosen. Vaccine delivery systems across Canada need substantial improvements to ensure optimal uptake and equitable access for all. Our findings suggest a more equitable model for vaccine delivery featuring early establishment of local barrier-free clinics, culturally safe and representative environment, as well as multi-lingual assistance, among other vulnerability-sensitive elements. © 2022 Kholina et al.

10.1016/j.pubrev.2022.102251,narrative counters: understanding the efficacy of narratives in combating anecdote-based vaccine misinformation,"This study investigated the efficacy of narratives in countering vaccine-related narrative misinformation on Facebook. Two narrative counter strategies to address misinformation about the safety of the MMR vaccine (i.e., personal stories of uneventful vaccinations where a parent talks about how their child was vaccinated and no injury happened to them, and narratives of anti-vax to pro-vax conversions, where a former anti-vaccine parent narrates their experience of their child getting sick with a vaccine-preventable disease and thus realizing the importance of vaccines) were compared to a non-narrative counter message (an infographic, in the case of the present study) in increasing belief in the counter, reducing vaccine misinformation, and increasing MMR vaccination intentions. Second, we tested a theoretically grounded model predicting MMR vaccination intentions and misinformation amplification likelihood, combining pre-existing issue-specific situational motivation in problem solving with perceived counter and misinformation source credibility and message effects. Implications for public relations theory are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

To fill this void, this study explores this relationship while distinguishing between knowledge related to uncontested issues and knowledge related to issues that have been subject to public controversies (climate change, vaccination, genetically modified organisms, crime, and immigration). Relying on a large-scale survey among Swedish citizens conducted in 2020 (N = 2,160), we find that the relationship with patterns of news use is substantially different across these types of beliefs. Among other things, the results suggest that knowledge of uncontested issue domains is positively related to news use, but knowledge of contested issue domains is not. The intentional avoidance of news is only negatively related to knowledge of contested issues. Taken together, the results suggest that the mechanisms driving beliefs related to uncontested versus contested issues are substantially different. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.1007/s44204-022-00042-2,"people, posts, and platforms: reducing the spread of online toxicity by contextualizing content and setting norms","We present a novel model of individual people, online posts, and media platforms to explain the online spread of epistemically toxic content such as fake news and suggest possible responses. We argue that a combination of technical features, such as the algorithmically curated feed structure, and social features, such as the absence of stable social-epistemic norms of posting and sharing in social media, is largely responsible for the unchecked spread of epistemically toxic content online. Sharing constitutes a distinctive communicative act, governed by a dedicated norm and motivated to a large extent by social identity maintenance. But confusion about this norm and its lack of inherent epistemic checks lead readers to misunderstand posts, attribute excess or insufficient credibility to posts, and allow posters to evade epistemic accountability—all contributing to the spread of epistemically toxic content online. This spread can be effectively addressed if (1) people and platforms add significantly more context to shared posts and (2) platforms nudge people to develop and follow recognized epistemic norms of posting and sharing. © 2022, The Author(s).",

Social Media Users’ trust in government is analyzed based on their perceived misinformation and knowledge about government measures taken to deal with the pandemic at that earlier stage. The study found that social media users who perceive a lesser amount of misinformation have a higher knowledge of government measures. Consequently, more knowledge about those measures predicts a higher level of trust in government. The study also demonstrates that a higher level of trust in government can help people secure more knowledge about government measures amidst misinformation. The results suggest that predisposition to trust based on government performance evaluation, individual and societal level values and beliefs, and culture of trusting institutions could play a pivotal role in determining how people perceive misinformation and knowledge about government measures. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Sentiment-encoded social media indicators have been poorly developed for expressed text to forecast healthcare pressure and infer population risk-perception patterns. Here we introduce Infodemic Tomography (InTo) as the first web-based interactive infoveillance cybertechnology that forecasts and visualizes spatio-temporal sentiments and healthcare pressure as a function of social media positivity (i.e., Twitter here), considering both epidemic information and potential misinformation. Information spread is measured on volume and retweets, and the Value of Misinformation (VoMi) is introduced as the impact on forecast accuracy where misinformation has the highest dissimilarity in information dynamics. We validated InTo for COVID-19 in New Delhi and Mumbai by inferring distinct socio-epidemiological risk-perception patterns. We forecast weekly hospitalization and cases using ARIMA models and interpolate spatial hospitalization using geostatistical kriging on inferred risk perception curves between tweet positivity and epidemiological outcomes. Geospatial tweet positivity tracks accurately ∼ 60% of hospitalizations and forecasts hospitalization risk hotspots along risk aversion gradients. VoMi is higher for risk-prone areas and time periods, where misinformation has the highest non-linear predictability, with high incidence and positivity manifesting popularity-seeking social dynamics. Hospitalization gradients, VoMi, effective healthcare pressure and spatial model-data gaps can be used to predict hospitalization fluxes, misinformation, healthcare capacity gaps and surveillance uncertainty. Thus, InTo is a participatory instrument to better prepare and respond to public health crises by extracting and combining salient epidemiological and social surveillance at any desired space-time scale. © 2022, The Author(s).",
10.1177/00027162231174320,social media data for firearms research: promise and perils,"Firearms research has been hindered by a persistent lack of high-quality, reliable, and timely data. Using social media data in firearms research is, therefore, appealing: these data are large in scale, continuously provided, passively obtained, inexpensive in some cases, and easily combined with data from traditional sources. We consider how social media data have been used in firearms research to date and how they can be best used moving forward. Despite the many advantages of using social media data, there are key analytical and ethical considerations associated with their use, including understanding the underlying population, constructing valid and reliable measures from shared content, the possibility of false data and misinformation through fake accounts, and concerns having to do with the privacy and consent of social media users. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, we show that there is a compelling case for the continued development of these data for firearms research and suggest principles for their responsible use in this context. © 2023 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115497,when the influencer says jump! how influencer signaling affects engagement with covid-19 misinformation,"With signaling theory, credibility, and social media engagement (SME) as guiding frameworks, this study used an experiment to examine how social media influencers (SMIs) affect how people engage with COVID-19 misinformation. SMI-promoted information elicited more SME, credibility, and purchase likelihood than non-SMI promoted information. The most effective message was a post promoted by an SMI that contained detailed information about an authentic product. However, data indicated nuance regarding the effect of SMIs. The authenticity of the information as well as the amount of detail in the post played a role. Additionally, mediated effects analysis showed that the impact of SME on purchase likelihood was higher among non-SMI followers. Data suggests that using a multi-signal messaging approach is suitable regardless of promotion by an SMI. This has important implications to public health messaging and the author discusses how health agencies may effectively signal information to the public. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

Data were collected from March to May 2021 using an online survey. Overall, 1,444 participants took part in the study. From this pool of respondents, 528 indicated motivating factors in favor of the COVID-19 vaccination (86.5% were women; aged between 20 and 75 years), while 198 mentioned barriers against the COVID-19 vaccination (92.9% were women; aged between 19 and 68 years). The thematic analysis was conducted on two open-ended questions. The main motivators reported for COVID-19 vaccination were belief in the effectiveness of the vaccine, benefits of easing COVID-19 restrictions, responsibility, and restriction or pressure in case of non-vaccination. The main barriers reported regarding the COVID-19 vaccination were concerns about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, perceived health risks of vaccination, risk perception toward COVID-19, misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, belief that vaccination is being imposed, and belief in the conspiracy theories surrounding COVID-19. The results of this study help identify the existing motivating and hindering factors for COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs in Latvia. These results can be used to promote vaccination in HCW, develop information campaigns, and alleviate concerns of HCW.

Teaching about abortion encompasses many things: managing the beliefs of students and teachers; state regulations around teaching or talking about abortion in schools; available resources; and the cultural miseducation and stigma around abortion. As social media becomes more accessible and widely used, educators can use it as a tool for teaching sensitive issues and navigating some of the restrictions and difficulties teaching about abortion comes with. This article explores current considerations and issues around abortion education and how TikTok can be used to teach this sensitive topic both inside and outside of the classroom, especially with adolescents and young adults. With its 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok is a potential educational space for teaching about abortion by spreading accurate information, engaging the audience, and working to open lines of communication to combat abortion stigma. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1038/s41598-022-15769-4,a continuous time meta-analysis of the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and individual preventive behavior during the covid-19 pandemic,"In several longitudinal studies, reduced willingness to show COVID-19-related preventive behavior (e.g., wearing masks, social distancing) has been partially attributed to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs. However, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the strength of the relationship and whether the negative relationship exists in both directions (reciprocal effects). One explanation of the heterogeneity pertains to the fact that the time interval between consecutive measurement occasions varies (e.g., 1 month, 3 months) both between and within studies. Therefore, a continuous time meta-analysis based on longitudinal studies was conducted. This approach enables one to examine how the strength of the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 preventive behavior depends on the time interval. In total, 1035 correlations were coded for 17 samples (N = 16,350). The results for both the full set of studies and a subset consisting of 13 studies corroborated the existence of reciprocal effects. Furthermore, there was some evidence of publication bias. The largest cross-lagged effects were observed between 3 and 6 months, which can inform decision-makers and researchers when carrying out interventions or designing studies examining the consequences of new conspiracy theories. © 2022, The Author(s).",

These journalists did most of their reporting from remote locations as the conflict zones were too dangerous to be physically present. We investigated how the journalist did their jobs with the communicative affordances of digital tools and how digital trust-building occurred. The trust-building process between journalists and sources shifted across platforms and according to the technologies’ communicative affordances. We established that reporters had embraced the flow of news material on social media platforms as a valuable source of information, but after exercising extreme caution. Journalists upheld the boundaries that separated them from amateurs by emphasizing their role in making sense of events. They also fortified their gatekeeping role through verifying and vetting information–a task needed to maintain credibility and protect readers and viewers from misinformation and propaganda. Encrypted messaging applications such as WhatsApp played a major role in speeding up communication with and protecting potential sources and verification. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

This study examines how experiences of EVD infection, and preventive measures such as social distancing, were linked to experiences of stigma and social exclusion among those reintegrating into their communities. Methods Key informant interviews (n = 42) and focus group discussions (n = 27) were conducted in districts with a high prevalence of EVD and representing geographical and ethnic diversity (n = 228 participants). The final sample was composed of adults (52%) and children (48%) who were EVD-infected (46%) and -affected (42%) individuals, and community leaders (12%). Data were coded using a Grounded Theory approach informed by Thematic Content Analysis, and analyzed using NVivo. Interrater reliability was high, with Cohen’s κ = 0.80 or higher. Findings Participants described two main sources of EVD-related stress: isolation from the community because of social distancing and other prevention measures such as quarantine, and stigma related to infected or affected status. Participants linked experiences of social isolation and stigma to significant distress and feelings of ostracization. These experiences were particularly pronounced among children. Sources of support included community reintegration over time, and formal community efforts to provide education and establish protection bylaws. Interpretation This study found that social distancing and EVD-related stigma were each prominent sources of distress among participants. These results suggest that isolation because of infection, and the enduring stigmatization of infected individuals and their families, demand coordinated responses to prevent and mitigate additional psychosocial harm. Such responses should include close engagement with community leaders to combat misinformation and promote community reintegration. © 2022 Crea et al.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115522,increased belief in vaccination conspiracy theories predicts increases in vaccination hesitancy and powerlessness: results from a longitudinal study,"Rationale: Vaccinations are an important part of a public health strategy against preventable diseases, and uptake is influenced by factors including hesitancy. The belief of vaccine related misinformation including anti-vaccination conspiracy theories has been found to be associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Objective: While research suggests that these conspiracy theory beliefs may arise to satisfy unmet needs such as restoring loss of personal control, somewhat ironically these anti-vaccination conspiracy theories may frustrate these needs. This study examined the causal relationships between vaccination hesitancy, vaccination conspiracy theories, and vaccination related powerlessness. Methods: Using a stationary random intercepts cross lagged panel model, we investigated the temporal ordering of vaccination hesitancy, powerlessness, and vaccination conspiracy theory beliefs in a sample of Australian adults (N = 500) in a longitudinal study with 5-timepoints over 4-months between June and October 2021. Results: Results from a random intercept cross-lagged model, that separates between-person stability from within-person change, suggested that increased belief in vaccination conspiracy theories was associated with future increases in vaccination hesitancy and powerlessness (but not vice versa). Findings also showed that increases in vaccination hesitancy and conspiracy theory beliefs predicted respective increases from a person's trait-level mean at subsequent timepoints. Conclusions: Vaccination conspiracy theories appear to increase vaccination powerlessness and hesitancy, rather than satisfying an unmet need for personal control. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

Belief in conspiracy theories and non-psychological cures and prevention methods were negatively associated to social distancing, while the latter also predicted lower preventive commodities purchasing.

10.1002/jip.1604,drawing conclusions: instructing witnesses to draw what happened to them,"We reviewed the child and the adult literature on the impact of witnesses drawing what happened on the number of details recalled and the accuracy of the reported details. Most experiments reported a beneficial effect of drawing what happened (or drawing the scene) on the number of details reported primarily in free recall and sometimes also in cued recall. The consensus across studies was that drawing protocols did not negatively impact the accuracy of reported details (when accuracy was attainable) unless suggestive details were drawn. These results were largely consistent regardless of interviewer expertise or protocol used. Draw-and-tell instructions should be considered by forensic investigators for the following reasons: (1) the beneficial effect on number of details recalled with no detriment to accuracy, (2) the added benefit for children who need additional interviewer support, and (3) the ease at which the instruction can be implemented with minimal expertise or training. However, more ecologically valid research is needed to establish the efficacy of drawing (1) in forensic interviews, (2) in the presence of misinformation, (3) across instances of repeated event memory, and (4) across sequential interviews. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

QAnon’s viral disinformation contributed to violent crimes committed by QAnon followers based on their conspiratorial beliefs, as well as to participation of some QAnon followers in the January 6th attack on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, and to widespread COVID vaccine hesitancy and rejection among believers. This paper presents a to-date unexplored additional cost of conspiracy beliefs: the emotional, social and political toll a relationship with QAnon followers can have on their loved ones. In an Internet survey of 288 U.S.-based participants, a majority (80%) reported having a QAnon-following family member or friend. These relationships have suffered as a result of the loved one’s conspiratorial beliefs, leading to self-reported emotional distress and reevaluation of participants’ views of the government and society. Participants with a QAnon loved one reported higher anxiety and PTSD than those without such connection. On average, participants viewed QAnon as significantly more radical (willing to engage in illegal or violent acts) than themselves. Perceived QAnon radicalization was predicted by own anxiety and by relationship deterioration with QAnon loved one. The discussion focuses on the importance of tracking these secondhand effects of conspiracy theories as drivers of political polarization. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

While the effectiveness of these measures is disputed, our study - which is based on a rarely occurring natural experiment - makes an empirical contribution in this direction. Based on the analysis of survey materials collected in Mariupol, Ukraine, around the time of the tumultuous events surrounding the Belarusian presidential election of 2020, we show that, given the right conditions, a critical juncture event in one country can rapidly influence existing patterns of relevant conspiracy belief in a neighbouring one. The right conditions, in this case, include a massive disinformation campaign channelled through (pro-)Russian media, against the backdrop of conspiracy theories already in circulation in Ukraine. The implication of this finding is that the disinformation weapon becomes far more effective when it manages to offer a straightforward explanation (a conspiracy theory) of a critical juncture event that is otherwise complex and multilayered, and that adequate psychological defence mechanisms are needed to mitigate and counter this effect.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022",

The model input of this approach is the specification of the flow of information. This enables the representation of (i) reliable information, (ii) noise, and (iii) disinformation, in a unified framework. Because the approach is designed to characterize the dynamics of the behavior of people, it is possible to quantify the impact of information control, including those resulting from the dissemination of disinformation. It is shown that if a decision maker assigns an exceptionally high weight on one of the alternative realities, then under the Bayesian logic their perception hardly changes in time even if evidences presented indicate that this alternative corresponds to a false reality. Thus, confirmation bias need not be incompatible with Bayesian updating. By observing the role played by noise in other areas of natural sciences, where noise is used to excite the system away from false attractors, a new approach to tackle the dark forces of fake news is proposed.

10.1108/IJPL-08-2021-0048,the massive spreads and fatalities of covid-19 pandemic in the usa: symptoms of leadership failure,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine whether the massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the country with the most advanced medical technology in the world, are symptomatic of leadership failure. The authors posit that when political leaders, such as the President of the USA, in conjunction with a group of state governors and city mayors, employed conspiracy theories and disinformation to achieve their political goals, they contributed to the massive spreads and fatalities of the virus, and they also undermined the credibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the health-care professionals in providing the pertinent control guidelines and true scientific-based medical information. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a review of current studies that address the handling of global infectious diseases to build a better understanding of the issue of pandemics. They then employed a theoretical framework to link the massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic to political leaders, such as President Trump and the group of obsequious state governors and city mayors, who propagated conspiracy theories and disinformation through social media platforms to downplay the severity of the virus. The authors compared the massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA under President Trump to President Obama who handled H1N1, Ebola, Zika and Dengue. More importantly, the authors compared President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to other political leaders in advanced countries where there were no concerted efforts to spread conspiracy theories and disinformation about the health risks of COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The authors' theoretical analysis alluded to the fact that political leaders, such as President Trump, who are engulfed in self-deceptions, self-projections and self-aggrandizements would engage in self-promotion and avoid accountability for their missteps in handling global pandemic shocks. In contrast, political leaders in other advanced countries did not downplay the severity thus their ability to curtail the spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical viewpoints presented in this paper along with the derivations of the spreads–fatalities curtailment coefficients and the spread–fatality upsurge coefficients under Presidents Obama and Trump, respectively, may not be replicable. Given this plausible limitation, future research may need to provide a deep analysis of the amplifications of conspiracy theories and disinformation because they are now deeply rooted in the political economy of the USA. Furthermore, since scientists and medical professionals may not be able to forecast future epidemics or pandemics with pin-point accuracy nor predict how political leaders would disseminate health risks information associated with different pathogens, it is imperative that future research addresses the positive or adverse effects of conspiracy theories and disinformation that are now easily propagated simultaneously through different social media platforms, which are currently protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The multiplier effects of conspiracy theories and disinformation will continue to amplify the division about the authenticity of COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or reemergence of other pathogens in the foreseeable future. Originality/value: The authors derived the unique spreads-fatalities curtailment coefficients to demonstrate how President Obama used effective collaboration and coordination at all levels of government in conjunction with medical experts to curtail the spreads and fatalities associated with H1N1, Ebola, Zika and Dengue. They further derived the spreads-fatalities upsurge coefficients to highlight how President Trump contributed to the spreads and fatalities of COVID-19 pandemic through his inability to collaborate and coordinate with state governors, city mayors and different health-care agencies at the national and international levels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

However, a validated instrument to measure the level of students’ acceptance on the CT about COVID-19 still remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the questionnaire of CT about COVID-19. The questionnaire consisted of 14 items and delivered online to the 400 students of Biology education in Indonesia. The data was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). All items have standard deviation between 1.60 and 2.63, but one item was revealed to have insignificant correlation. The EFA result indicated that the other 13 items had loading factor 0.5 and were categorized into three dimensions. The third dimension was eliminated after the administration of CFA due to only one item in the dimension (λ>0.5). There were three items in the first dimension and two items in the second dimension resulted in λ<0.5. The correlated model from CFA disclosed good values of goodness of fit (GOF), χ2/df=2.527, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)=0.014, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.964, goodness-of-fit index (GFI)=0.969, adjusted goodness of fit (AGFI)=0.940, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI)=0.947, and normed fit index (NFI)=0.943. Therefore, the questionnaire is strongly recommended to measure the level of students’ beliefs toward the CT of COVID-19. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.",

We conducted 32 interviews with undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States to examine how digital technologies mediated their experiences of the pandemic. We find that undocumented immigrants (1) face barriers to telehealth services, (2) are at high risk of COVID-19 misinformation, (3) experience difficulties in assessing privacy risks, and (4) experienced heterogeneous outcomes of technology use during the pandemic. Our analysis shows that digital technologies both supported and further marginalized undocumented immigrants during the pandemic. Future research on the digital inclusion of vulnerable populations should pay particular attention to the interaction between their underlying vulnerabilities, on one hand, and attitudes, uses, and outcomes associated with technology, on the other. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.115112,sociopolitical and psychological correlates of covid-19 vaccine hesitancy in the united states during summer 2021,"Vaccine hesitancy and refusal continue to hamper COVID-19 control efforts. Throughout the pandemic, scientists and journalists have attributed lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates to a shifting set of factors including demography, experiences during the height of the pandemic, political views, and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation, among others. However, these factors have rarely been tested comprehensively, in tandem, or alongside other potentially underlying psychological factors, thus limiting our understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This cross-sectional study assesses a diverse set of correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy identified in previous studies using US survey data (N = 2055) collected in July–August 2021. The survey contained modules designed to assess various sociopolitical domains and anti- and pro-social personality characteristics hypothesized to shape vaccine hesitancy. Using logistic and multinomial regression, we found that the strongest correlate of vaccine hesitancy was belief in misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines, though we surmise that this common explanation may be endogenous to vaccine hesitancy. Political beliefs explained more variation in vaccine hesitancy—and in particular, vaccine refusal—after belief in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation was excluded from the analysis. Our findings help reconcile numerous disparate findings across the literature with implications for health education and future research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1016/j.paid.2022.111522,believing in nothing and believing in everything: the underlying cognitive paradox of anti-covid-19 vaccine attitudes,"A major reason why some people oppose the COVID-19 vaccine is the influence of misinformation. This study suggests that the cognitive paradox of simultaneously believing known facts less and new, “alternative facts” more is the outcome of a distrust mindset, characterized by spontaneous consideration of alternatives, including misinformation. We captured this paradox and its correlates in a scale that measures individuals' ability to distinguish between the truth value of well-established facts (“Earth rotates eastward around its own axis, completing a full rotation once in about 24 h”) and baseless “alternative facts” (“Earth can change its rotation direction and flip its axis, and we will never notice it”). Assuming that an anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitude arises from a chronically distrusting mindset, we sampled participants on Prolific who were pre-screened for their COVID-19 vaccine attitude based on earlier responses. We found that people who rejected COVID-19 vaccines believed well-established facts less, and “alternative facts” more, compared to supporters of the vaccine. Less discernment between truths and falsehoods was correlated with less intellectual humility, more distrust and greater reliance on one's intuition. This observed thought pattern offers insights into theoretical understanding of the antecedents of belief in “alternative facts” and conspiracy theories. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1177/14648849211060628,beyond verification: flesh witnessing and the significance of embodiment in conflict news,"Platform journalism in the global North is caught within a fragile political economy of emotion and attention, defined, on the one hand, by the proliferation of user-generated, affective news and, on the other, by the risk of fake news and a technocratic commitment to verification. While the field of Journalism Studies has already engaged in rich debates on how to rethink the truth conditions of user-generated content (UGC) in platform journalism, we argue that it has missed out on the ethico-political function of UGC as testimonials of lives-at-risk. If we wish to recognize and act on UGC as techno-social practices of witnessing human pain and death, we propose, then we need to push further the conceptual and analytical boundaries of the field. In this paper, we do this by introducing a view of UGC as flesh witnessing, that is as embodied and mobile testimonies of vulnerable others that, enabled by smartphones, enter global news environments as appeals to attention and action. Drawing on examples from the Syrian conflict, we provide an analysis of the narrative strategies through which flesh witnessing acquires truth-telling authority and we reflect on what is gained and lost in the process. Western story-telling, we conclude, strategically co-opts the affective dimension of flesh witnessing – its focus on child innocence, heroic martyrdom or the data aesthetics of destruction – and selectively minimizes its urgency by downplaying or effacing the bodies of non-western witnesses. This preoccupation with verification should not be subject to geopolitical formulations and needs to be combined with an explicit acknowledgement of the embodied voices of conflict as testimonies of the flesh whose often mortal vulnerability is, in fact, the very condition of possibility upon which western broadcasting rests. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0268133,"corona was scary, lockdown was worse: a mixed-methods study of community perceptions on covid-19 from urban informal settlements of mumbai","The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the multiple vulnerabilities of people living in urban informal settlements globally. To bring community voices from such settlements to the center of COVID-19 response strategies, we undertook a study in the urban informal settlements of Dharavi, Mumbai, from September 2020-April 2021. In this study, we have examined the awareness, attitudes, reported practices, and some broader experiences of the community in Dharavi with respect to COVID-19. We have used a mixed-methods approach, that included a cross-sectional survey of 468 people, and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 49 people living in this area. Data was collected via a mix of phone and face-to-face interviews. We have presented here the descriptive statistics from the survey and the key themes that emerged from our qualitative data. People reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19, with television (90%), family and friends (56%), and social media (47%) being the main sources of information. The knowledge people had, however, was not free of misconceptions and fear; people were scared of being forcefully quarantined and dying alone during the early days of COVID-19. These fears had negative repercussions in the form of patient-related stigma and hesitancy in seeking healthcare. A year into the pandemic, however, people reported a shift in attitudes from ‘extreme fear to low fear’ (67% reported perceiving low/no COVID risk in October 2020), contributing to a general laxity in following COVID-appropriate behaviors. Currently, the community is immensely concerned about the revival of livelihoods, that have been adversely impacted due to the lockdown in 2020 as well as the continued ‘othering’ of Dharavi for being a COVID hotspot. These findings suggest that urban informal settlements like Dharavi need community-level messaging that counters misinformation and denial of the outbreak; local reinforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviours; and long-term social protection measures. © 2022 Ramani et al.

10.1093/ct/qtab011,an empirical procedure to evaluate misinformation rejection and deception in mediated communication contexts,"Although misleading health information is not a new phenomenon, no standards exist to assess consumers' ability to detect and subsequently reject misinformation. Part of this deficit reflects theoretical and measurement challenges. After drawing novel connections among legal, regulatory, and philosophical perspectives on false, misleading or deceptive advertising and cognitive-process models of persuasive communication, we define deception and misinformation rejection. Recognizing that individuals can hold beliefs that align with a persuasive message without those beliefs having been influenced by it, we derive empirical criteria to test for evidence of these constructs that center on yielding or not yielding to misinformation in mediated contexts. We present data from an experimental study to illustrate the proposed test procedure and provide evidence for two theoretically derived patterns indicative of misinformation rejection. The resulting definitions and empirical procedure set the stage for additional theorizing and empirical studies on misinformation in the marketplace.  © 2021 The Author(s).

In this article I examine COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies in the United States (US). These misinformation and conspiracies have been commonly argued to be anti-science. I argue, although it is important to rebut false information and stop their spread, social scientists need to analyse how such anti-science claims are discursively framed and interpreted. Specifically, I show how the framing of the anti-science conspiracies utilise the credibility of science and scientists. I also explore how the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were given different meaning among different social groups. The article is divided into three sections. In the first section I analyse the discursive emplotment of the Plandemic video that had Dr Judy Mikovits presenting several COVID–19 conspiracy theories and went viral before it was taken down from major social media platforms. I show how the video draws on the credibility of science, scientists, and scientific journals to present misinformation and conspiracies claims against vaccination, mask wearing, etc. The second section explores how COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were interpreted among the African-American community by drawing on the history of black community’s experiences in the US and as such how their interpretations stand in contrast to the interpretations of the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies among the White community. The last section analyses the role of STS in engaging with anti-science and post-truth issues and emphasises the need to excavate genealogies of the present even with regard to misinformation and conspiracies. © 2022 SAGE Publications.",
NA,academic librarians’ activities in creating social-media authority in three selected nigerian university libraries,"The proliferation of mass data on the internet is currently witnessing spoof of different websites and fake content in some of the social media platforms. This development prompted academic libraries/librarians not to trust completely, some of the information (contents) in the social media arena. In order to avoid errors, rumours, and misinformation which can easily spread through social media channels, librarians as information professionals become duty-bound to check the validity and reliability of the contents so as to maintain trust, credibility, and authority in the social media units of the libraries. Therefore, this study is set (a) to investigate how academic libraries/librarians create users' trust, build a reputation and maintain social authority; and,( b) to explore the constraints of academic libraries/librarians in maintaining social media authority in Nigerian academic libraries. It is a qualitative research approach, using Rogers's 2010 Diffusion of Innovation theory, based on the Innovation Decision Process. The results indicated that academic libraries/librarians have been in the vanguard of establishing credible content on their social media platforms. Libraries and librarians are shifting focus from the traditional method of checking the authority and validity of information (content) to a new way of assessing the authority of content in academic libraries. Also, it was found that academic librarians' behavioral attitudes towards social media content such as inappropriate content, lack of teamwork, lack of management support, and lack of social media policies, among other issues are impediments to the flow of establishing credible social media authority in the academic libraries. Notwithstanding, the researchers offer suggestions for social media libraries/librarians to brace up and work-hand-glove to strategize and know more about the contents the customers may have passion therein, in order to earn trust, maintain online reputation and gain social authority in the academic libraries. © 2022, Archlib and Information Services Ltd.

Through a case study of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, this article’s first half considers how contemporary cybersecurity has produced ‘racial division’ as an object of security by framing the BLM movement as a geopolitical vulnerability open to foreign manipulation through social media. In its emphasis on the political protest as a site of insecurity, I argue that contemporary cybersecurity has widened its traditional spatiality ‘beyond the computer’. In the article’s second half, I argue that the racialization of cybersecurity has underwritten a politics of truth ultimately concerned less with parsing true from false, and more with defining the boundaries of secure political knowledge and communication. I argue that contemporary cybersecurity has produced an idealized subject for whom an obligation to possess contingent forms of knowledge becomes a condition of secure political subjectivity. I conclude with a critique of contemporary cybersecurity’s tendency to portray dissident political movements like BLM as ignorant or disinformed. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0266397,covid-19 vaccination readiness among multiple racial and ethnic groups in the san francisco bay area: a qualitative analysis,"Background COVID-19 vaccination rates are lower among historically marginalized populations, including Black/African American and Latinx populations, threatening to contribute to already high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality disparities for these groups. We conducted a community-based participatory research study using qualitative methods to explore knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination among Black/African American, Latinx, and Chinese American residents of the San Francisco Bay Area and assess their views on vaccination outreach and delivery strategies. Methods and findings Data were collected from January 14, 2021, to February 24, 2021, with adult residents (N = 109 [Female: N = 76; 70%]) in San Francisco. Focus groups (N = 10) and in-depth interviews (N = 25) were conducted among Black/African Americans (N = 35), Latinx (N = 40), and Chinese Americans (n = 34) in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Themes were identified using grounded field theory, and included misinformation, mistrust of government and health institutions, and linguistic and other barriers to vaccine access. All three racial/ethnic groups had experiences with vaccine misinformation and information overload. Many African American and Latinx participants cited structural and interpersonal racism, and anti-immigrant discrimination, as factors reducing their trust in government and public health disseminated information and their willingness to be vaccinated. Participants expressed trust in community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations and community-run clinics. Participants often experienced barriers to vaccine access, such as transportation to drive-in sites, with Latinx and Chinese American groups also frequently citing language barriers. Conclusions Vaccine outreach strategies must acknowledge how longstanding systemic, institutional, and structural racism contributes to mistrust in government and health institutions and engage with and support trusted messengers from the community to eliminate cultural, linguistic, and other barriers to vaccine access.

10.3390/philosophies7030054,"different roles for multiple perspectives and rigorous testing in scientific theories and models: towards more open, context-appropriate verificationism","A form of context-appropriate verificationism is proposed that distinguishes between scientific theories as evolving systems of ideas and operationally-specified, testable formal-empirical models. Theories undergo three stages (modes): a formative, exploratory, heuristic phase of theory conception, a developmental phase of theory-pruning and refinement, and a mature, rigorous phase of testing specific, explicit models. The first phase depends on Feyerabendian open possibility, the second on theoretical plausibility and internal coherence, and the third on testability (falsifiability, predictive efficacy). Multiple perspectives produce variety necessary for theory formation, whereas explicit agreement on evaluative criteria is essential for testing. Hertzian observer-mechanics of empirical-deductive scientific models are outlined that use semiotic operations of measurement/evaluation, computation, and physical action/construction. If models can be fully operationalized, then they can be intersubjectively verified (tested) irrespective of metaphysical, theoretical, value-, or culture-based disagreements. Verificationism can be expanded beyond simple predictive efficacy to incorporate testing for pragmatic, functional efficacy in engineering, medicine, and design contexts. Such a more open, pragmatist, operationalist, epistemically-constructivist perspective is suggested in which verification is contingent on the type of assertion (e.g., heuristic, analytic, empirical, pragmatic), its intended purpose, degree and reliability of model-based evidence, and existence of alternate, compet-ing predictive models. Suggestions for epistemological hygiene amidst the world-wide pandemic of misinformation and propaganda are offered. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

This study was a descriptive-analytical survey in which 450 participants were selected for the study. The data collection instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data through SPSS. The findings show that a wide range of mass media has become well known as information resources for COVID-19. Other findings indicate a significant statistical difference in the rate of using information resources during COVID-19 based on age and gender; however, this difference is not significant regarding the reliability of information resources with regard to age and gender. Health information has an undisputable role in the prevention and control of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19.

10.1002/jcpy.1290,how misinformation taints our belief system: a focus on belief updating and relational reasoning,"This commentary complements Stanley et al.'s (2022) target article by concentrating on the process of false belief construction and its associated cognitive mechanisms. It also concurs with the target article that a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms by which consumers revise their truth judgments in view of new evidence is needed. Specifically, this essay develops two main dimensions: the first about what we know from the actual construction of truth judgments; the second about what we know from the cognitive mechanisms by which truth judgments are constructed. Particularly on this second dimension, I develop the idea that relational reasoning is key to understanding how individuals integrate new information within their internal belief systems. These two dimensions are both process-minded, yet one is about how beliefs evolve over time, whereas the other is about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie belief construction. Overall, an understanding of these two elements is crucial to finding behavioral interventions that may curb the spread of misinformation. © 2022 Society for Consumer Psychology.",

Specifically, anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs can have a strong negative impact on COVID-19 vaccination attitude and intention. The present study aimed to clarify how such beliefs can reduce vaccination intention, exploring the possible mediating roles of attitude toward vaccination, trust in science, and trust in government, among a sample of 822 unvaccinated Italian adults (Women = 67.4%; Mage = 38.1). Path analysis showed that anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs influenced intention to get vaccinated both directly and indirectly through the mediating effects of attitude, trust in science, and trust in government. In particular, the simple mediating effect of attitude was the strongest one, followed by the serial mediating effect of trust in science and attitude itself. Findings provide insights into the design of interventions aimed at reducing misinformation and subsequent vaccine hesitancy. Copyright © 2022 Capasso, Caso and Zimet.",
10.3758/s13421-021-01232-8,the role of discomfort in the continued influence effect of misinformation,"Research examining the continued influence effect (CIE) of misinformation has reliably found that belief in misinformation persists even after the misinformation has been retracted. However, much remains to be learned about the psychological mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Most theorizing in this domain has focused on cognitive mechanisms. Yet some proposed cognitive explanations provide reason to believe that motivational mechanisms might also play a role. The present research tested the prediction that retractions of misinformation produce feelings of psychological discomfort that motivate one to disregard the retraction to reduce this discomfort. Studies 1 and 2 found that retractions of misinformation elicit psychological discomfort, and this discomfort predicts continued belief in and use of misinformation. Study 3 showed that the relations between discomfort and continued belief in and use of misinformation are causal in nature by manipulating how participants appraised the meaning of discomfort. These findings suggest that discomfort could play a key mechanistic role in the CIE, and that changing how people interpret this discomfort can make retractions more effective at reducing continued belief in misinformation. © 2021, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac137,the advantage of the right in social media news sharing,"We analyze social media activity during one of the largest protest mobilizations in US history to examine ideological asymmetries in the posting of news content. Using an unprecedented combination of four datasets (tracking offline protests, social media activity, web browsing, and the reliability of news sources), we show that there is no evidence of unreliable sources having any prominent visibility during the protest period, but we do identify asymmetries in the ideological slant of the sources shared on social media, with a clear bias towards right-leaning domains. These results support the amplification of the right thesis, which points to the structural conditions (social and technological) that lead to higher visibility of content with a partisan bent towards the right. Our findings provide evidence that right-leaning sources gain more visibility on social media and reveal that ideological asymmetries manifest themselves even in the context of movements with progressive goals. © 2022 Authors.

10.1371/journal.pone.0269606,understanding determinants of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in india: a qualitative study of government officials and civil society stakeholders,"Introduction Few studies have described the drivers of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance in India from the perspective of those involved in the design and implementation of vaccine campaigns–such as government officials and civil society stakeholders–a prerequisite to developing approaches to address this barrier to high immunization coverage and further child health improvements. Methods We conducted a qualitative study to understand government officials and civil society stakeholders’ perceptions of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India. We conducted in-depth phone interviews using a structured guide of open-ended questions with 21 participants from international and national non-governmental organizations, professional associations, and universities, and state and national government–six national-level stakeholders in New Delhi, six state-level stakeholders in Uttar Pradesh, six in Kerala, and three in Gujarat–from July 2020 to October 2020. We analyzed data through a multi-stage process following Grounded Theory. We present findings on individual-level, contextual, and vaccine/vaccination program-specific factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Results We identified multiple drivers and complex ways they influence vaccine beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors from the perspective of government officials and civil society stakeholders involved in vaccine campaigns. Important individual-level influences were low awareness of the benefits of vaccination, safety concerns, especially related to mild adverse events following immunization, and mistrust in government and health service quality. Contextual-level factors included communications, the media environment, and social media, which serves as a major conduit of misinformation and driver of hesitancy, as well as sociodemographic factors–specific drivers varied widely by income, education, urban/rural setting, and across religious and cultural groups. Among vaccine/vaccination-level issues, vaccine program design and delivery and the role of health care professionals emerged as the strongest determinants of hesitancy. Conclusions Drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India, as elsewhere, vary widely by local context; successful interventions should address individual, contextual, and vaccine-specific factors. While previous studies focused on individual-level factors, our study demonstrates the equal importance of contextual and vaccine-specific influences, especially the communication and media environment, influential leaders, sociodemographic factors, and frontline health workers.

The paper considers the current Zeitgeist along with the cultural factors that created the propitious ground for increasing media dissemination from the 1990s onwards. The growing influence of analytical psychology within the sociohistorical approach is valued. The author notes the vulnerability of the individual and collective consciousness to fake news and its insertion into competent and credible conspiracy theories.

10.1038/s41586-022-04805-y,c﻿ommunicating doctors’ consensus persistently increases covid-19 vaccinations,"The reluctance of people to get vaccinated represents a fundamental challenge to containing the spread of deadly infectious diseases1,2, including COVID-19. Identifying misperceptions that can fuel vaccine hesitancy and creating effective communication strategies to overcome them are a global public health priority3–5. Medical doctors are a trusted source of advice about vaccinations6, but media reports may create an inaccurate impression that vaccine controversy is prevalent among doctors, even when a broad consensus exists7,8. Here we show that public misperceptions about the views of doctors on the COVID-19 vaccines are widespread, and correcting them increases vaccine uptake. We implement a survey among 9,650 doctors in the Czech Republic and find that 90% of doctors trust the vaccines. Next, we show that 90% of respondents in a nationally representative sample (n = 2,101) underestimate doctors’ trust; the most common belief is that only 50% of doctors trust the vaccines. Finally, we integrate randomized provision of information about the true views held by doctors into a longitudinal data collection that regularly monitors vaccination status over 9 months. The treatment recalibrates beliefs and leads to a persistent increase in vaccine uptake. The approach demonstrated in this paper shows how the engagement of professional medical associations, with their unparalleled capacity to elicit individual views of doctors on a large scale, can help to create a cheap, scalable intervention that has lasting positive impacts on health behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s).",
10.3389/fpsyg.2022.983681,would you believe an intoxicated witness? the impact of witness alcohol intoxication status on credibility judgments and suggestibility,"Memory conformity may occur when a person’s belief in another’s memory report outweighs their belief in their own. Witnesses might be less likely to believe and therefore take on false information from intoxicated co-witnesses, due to the common belief that alcohol impairs memory performance. This paper presents an online study in which participants (n = 281) watched a video of a mock crime taking place outside a pub that included a witness either visibly consuming wine or a soft drink. Participants then read a statement from the witness that varied in the number of false details it contained before being asked to recall the crime. We found that the intoxicated witness was regarded as significantly less credible, but participants were not less likely to report misinformation from them. This suggests that intoxication status impacts one’s perception of how credible a source is, but not one’s ability to reject false suggestions from this source. Our findings reinforce the importance of minimizing co-witness discussion prior to interview, and not to assume that people automatically (correctly or not) discount information provided by intoxicated co-witnesses.

10.1016/j.tbs.2022.03.005,misinformation and misperception in the market for parking,"Parking regulations have been widely adopted by cities as a tool to tackle traffic-related externalities. Both researchers and practitioners have proposed parking policy interventions that tend to rely on the assumption that parkers have perfect information about the availability of parking options and their characteristics (prices and quality) when determining consumers’ behavior. However, research shows that when information acquisition (search) is costly it is rational for consumers not to be fully informed at the expense of their taking non-optimal decisions, with negative welfare implications. We conduct an empirical study of the level of knowledge and information held by drivers in the car parking market. We draw on a survey conducted with 576 garage customers in Barcelona to estimate different regression models to assess how drivers transform information into actual knowledge, identifying the factors that aggravate/mitigate misinformation and misperception (subjective information levels and its accuracy). We find that parkers know little about available parking alternatives and their prices, and the accuracy of their knowledge is poor and biased towards prioritizing curbside parking. Costly search does not help drivers increase their knowledge levels, with garage facilities’ and surrounding areas’ characteristics playing a relevant role. We also find that garages have effective obfuscation strategies to keep drivers uninformed and exploit their localized market power by reducing price saliency and increasing fee complexity. Our results suggest that information should be carefully considered in the design and implementation of parking policy interventions and transport information systems, in order to avoid undesired market distortions. © 2022 The Authors",

In this paper we explore what the emergence of fake news (understood as false news) represents for journalists, trying to answer the following question: Does false news pose a threat to the credibility of good journalism, causing a disruption of the traditional work? To answer it, we interviewed a sample of journalists from various media organizations in Portugal and Brazil. Among the main findings, journalists are aware that fake news is a problem to be faced, as the blame for the dissemination of false news erroneously lies with the profession. They are conscious that something must be done and agree that the best way to fight against fake news is to invest in media literacy. Most of the journalists of our sample think they must be also more cautious to check sources for veracity and for political motivations. The results show that there is a resolve to reinforce the role of journalism in society. © 2022 by the authors.",
10.5860/crl.83.5.765,"information literacy, diversity, and one-shot “pedagogies of the practical”","This essay examines the information literacy one-shot in conjunction with similar one-off training approaches often found in diversity education. Through this lens, we interrogate the ways that superficial approaches to complex issues such as mis-or disinformation and racism inhibit the kinds of engagement and (un)learning that transformative pedagogy requires as well as the structural conditions that give rise to such approaches. We find that information literacy and diversity one-shots emerged within the neoliberal turn in higher education and share a common philosophical foundation in liberalism and a belief that educated publics will come to consensus in the interest of the social good; they are based in narratives of individual deficiency, empowerment, and self-work. They are “pedagogies of the practical,” practices that ultimately fail to challenge white supremacist structures in higher education. Because education is about affect, emotion, and beliefs as well as knowledge, transactional one-shots can never truly be transformational or liberatory. We conclude by consid-ering the role of affect in teaching and learning, and how “pedagogies of emotion” might help us to better address power and race in the information literacy classroom. © 2022 Karen P.

10.3390/journalmedia3010014,gatekeepers as safekeepers—mapping audiences’ attitudes towards news media’s editorial oversight functions during the covid-19 crisis,"This study investigates people’s attitudes towards news media’s role as gatekeepers during the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, this concerns news media’s quality control and the selection of the most important news about the pandemic, as well as the provision of useful information and knowledge about the virus and its implications. Challenging research that has questioned the very idea of journalistic gatekeeping in hybrid media systems, we set out to explore people’s attitudes towards news media’s gatekeeper functions during a crisis, when the need for reliable and relevant information is extraordinarily high and the information environment is flooded with disinformation. In this situation, news media gatekeepers could serve as safekeepers that protect the population. Based on a national survey in Norway (N = 1024), a country characterized by high levels of trust in social institutions, including the national press, the study finds that people were generally supportive of news media’s gatekeeper functions amid the pandemic. However, there were noteworthy demographic differences. Older people, women, and those who were more highly educated showed more positive attitudes towards news media’s gatekeeping. Moreover, we found lower support for news media’s gatekeeping in the group who trusted alternative, right-wing news media. © 2022 by the authors.",

The capacity of distorted information to interfere in election processes or in political agendas has led different actors to create verification initiatives, which operate in partnership with the mass media. Recently, during the 2020 health crisis, false information has proved to have damaging power not only at the levels of politics or communication, but also at a health level. Therefore, the social need to access reliable and quality information, as well as verified information aimed at eradicating hoaxes, becomes evident. This paper focuses on the European context, analyzing the relationship between active verifiers and television stations that are members of the CIRCOM Network, considering their strategies and verification programs. Using a qualitative methodology an exploratory study has been carried out, mapping initiatives and stations by assessing their contribution of verified information to society. © 2021 by the authors.",
10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.04.011,"the deceitful connected and autonomous vehicle: defining the concept, contextualising its dimensions and proposing mitigation policies","The Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is an emerging mobility technology that may hold a paradigm-changing potential for the future of transport policy and planning. Despite a wealth of likely benefits that have made their eventual launch inescapable, CAVs may also be a source of unprecedented disruption for tomorrow's travel eco-systems because of their vulnerability to cyber-threats, hacking and misinformation. CAVs manipulated by users, traffic controllers or third parties may act in deceitful ways. This scene-setting work introduces the deceitful CAV, a vehicle that operates in a deceitful manner towards routing and control functionality for ‘selfish’ or malicious purposes and contextualises its diverse expressions and dimensions. It specifically offers a systematic taxonomy of eight distinctive deceitful behaviours namely: suppression/camouflage, overloading, mistake, substitution, target conditioning, repackaging capability signatures, amplification and reinforcing impression. These as exemplified by their most common attack forms (i.e., starvation, denial-of-service, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, poisoning, masquerading, flooding and spoofing) are then benchmarked against five key dimensions referring to time frame (short to long duration), engagement (localised to systemic), urban traffic controller infrastructure (single to multiple components), scale (low to high), and impact (low to high). We then suggest mitigation strategies to protect CAV technology against these dangers. These span from purely technological measures referring to the machine-centric triad of vehicles, communication, and control system including adversarial training, heuristic decision algorithms and weighted voting mechanisms to human factor measures that focus on education, training, awareness enhancement, licensing and legislation initiatives that will enable users and controllers to prevent, control or report deceitful activities. © 2022 The Authors",
10.1002/acp.3988,"children's memory and suggestibility years later: age, distress, and attachment","The accuracy of children's long-term memory for distressing events is of theoretical and legal interest. In this longitudinal study, 3- to 5-year-olds and their main parental caretakers individually participated in a mildly distressing event, and 1 h later the children's memory/suggestibility was assessed (Time 1). Six to seven years later (Time 2), the children (9- to 12-year-olds, N = 54) were again interviewed about the Time 1 experience. Their memory was more accurate at Time 1 than Time 2. Children who were rated as more distressed at Time 1 recalled more units of correct information at Time 2 if the children were older or lower in self-reported attachment anxiety. Children who were older at Time 2 were less suggestible. Time 1 misinformation did not contaminate Time 2 free recall.

10.1017/err.2021.48,governing fake news: the regulation of social media and the right to freedom of expression in the era of emergency,"Governments around the world are strictly regulating information on social media in the interests of addressing fake news. There is, however, a risk that the uncontrolled spread of information could increase the adverse effects of the COVID-19 health emergency through the influence of false and misleading news. Yet governments may well use health emergency regulation as a pretext for implementing draconian restrictions on the right to freedom of expression, as well as increasing social media censorship (ie chilling effects). This article seeks to challenge the stringent legislative and administrative measures governments have recently put in place in order to analyse their negative implications for the right to freedom of expression and to suggest different regulatory approaches in the context of public law. These controversial government policies are discussed in order to clarify why freedom of expression cannot be allowed to be jeopardised in the process of trying to manage fake news. Firstly, an analysis of the legal definition of fake news in academia is presented in order to establish the essential characteristics of the phenomenon (Section II). Secondly, the legislative and administrative measures implemented by governments at both international (Section III) and European Union (EU) levels (Section IV) are assessed, showing how they may undermine a core human right by curtailing freedom of expression. Then, starting from the premise of social media as a watchdog of democracy and moving on to the contention that fake news is a phenomenon of mature democracy, the article argues that public law already protects freedom of expression and ensures its effectiveness at the international and EU levels through some fundamental rules (Section V). There follows a discussion of the key regulatory approaches, and, as alternatives to government intervention, self-regulation and especially empowering users are proposed as strategies to effectively manage fake news by mitigating the risks of undue interference by regulators in the right to freedom of expression (Section VI). The article concludes by offering some remarks on the proposed solution and in particular by recommending the implementation of reliability ratings on social media platforms (Section VII). © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

10.1371/journal.pone.0266602,the new normal: covid-19 risk perceptions and support for continuing restrictions past vaccinations,"I test the possibility that over-estimating negative consequences of COVID-19 (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, and threats to children) will be associated with stronger support the ‘new normal’ (i.e., continuation of restrictions for an undefined period starting with wide-spread access to vaccines and completed vaccinations of vulnerable people). The new normal was assessed by endorsing practices such as vaccine passports, travel restrictions, mandatory masking, continuing contact tracing, and pursuing elimination. Results are based on five samples (N = 1,233 from April 2021 and N = 264 from January 2022) and suggest that people over-estimate COVID-19 risks to children and healthy people, as evidenced by median estimates that 5% of all global deaths were children, 29% were generally healthy people under 65, and that a healthy person under the age of 65 has 5% chance of dying from COVID-19. Over-estimates observed in this study align with those based on representative samples, and they were consistently related to stronger support for the new normal. This relationship emerged when participants estimated risks with percentages (core indicators) and indicated the extent to which risk-based statements are true/supported with evidence or false/unsupported (alternative indicators). People were notably more likely to support continuing restrictions if they believed that COVID-19 risk and risk mitigation tactics are true, even when they are not (e.g., children need to be prioritized for boosters). These relationships persisted when considering competing explanations (political ideology, statistics literacy, belief in conspiracy theories). I trace these effects to well-meaning efforts to prevent under-estimation. Public policy and people’s perceptions of risks are intertwined, where even inaccurate judgments may influence decisions. Failure to combat all misinformation with equal rigor may jeopardize the restoration of the social and economic life essential for building adaptive post-pandemic societies.

10.1177/1464884920924527,‘we are a neeeew generation’: early adolescents’ views on news and news literacy,"To function as well-informed citizens in democracy, early adolescents (12–16 years old) should become news literate news consumers. In this time of fragmented media use and evolving conceptions of (the importance and relevance of) news, this is not easy. Therefore, this focus group study investigated news consumption and news literacy through the eyes of early adolescents. Results showed that early adolescents have broad definitions of news. Their news consumption is predominantly passive, possibly due to a lack of intrinsic motivation. They see news as important, but often as boring, repetitive and negative, and disconnected from youth. Participants had knowledge of news content and effects, and stressed the importance of reliable news. However, for the majority, this did not translate into critical evaluation of news. For early adolescents, the key factor in becoming more news literate news consumers is motivation. Moving forward, motivation should be better incorporated in both research and practice. © The Author(s) 2020.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0274323,"covid-19 related stigma, empathy and intention for testing in jordan","Stigmatization of COVID-19 disease has been speculated due to misinformation about the disease, fearing of contracting the infection, absence of available cure, and holding responsibility for infecting others. We aimed to establish the prevalence of COVID-19 related stigma and its association with empathic responding, in addition to exploring predictors of stigma and testing intention among Jordanian people. A quantitative, descriptive and predictive design was used and data were collected using a web-based survey from 1074 adults. Findings showed that participants had high stigmatization against COVID-19 infection. Higher empathic responding (both cognitive and affective), being a female participant, and older age resulted in higher stigmatization. Only stigmatization of COVID-19 negatively predicted individuals’ intention for testing. These findings warrant intensive efforts from the Jordanian government on a local and national level to provide ongoing public education related to several aspects of COVID-19 disease, in order to reduce or prevent the associated stigma and increase people’s intention for testing. © 2022 Shahrour et al.

10.1093/jcmc/zmac008,the detection of political deepfakes,"Deepfake technology, allowing manipulations of audiovisual content by means of artificial intelligence, is on the rise. This has sparked concerns about a weaponization of manipulated videos for malicious ends. A theory on deepfake detection is presented and three preregistered studies examined the detection of deepfakes in the political realm (featuring UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Studies 1-3, or former U.S. President Barack Obama, Study 2). Based on two system models of information processing as well as recent theory and research on fake news, individual differences in analytic thinking and political interest were examined as predictors of correctly detecting deepfakes. Analytic thinking (Studies 1 and 2) and political interest (Study 1) were positively associated with identifying deepfakes and negatively associated with the perceived accuracy of a fake news piece about a leaked video (whether or not the deepfake video itself was presented, Study 3). Implications for research and practice are discussed.  © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Communication Association.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0268270,a potential mechanism for low tolerance feedback loops in social media flagging systems,"Many people use social media as a primary information source, but their questionable reliability has pushed platforms to contain misinformation via crowdsourced flagging systems. Such systems, however, assume that users are impartial arbiters of truth. This assumption might be unwarranted, as users might be influenced by their own political biases and tolerance for opposing points of view, besides considering the truth value of a news item. In this paper we simulate a scenario in which users on one side of the polarity spectrum have different tolerance levels for the opinions of the other side. We create a model based on some assumptions about online news consumption, including echo chambers, selective exposure, and confirmation bias. A consequence of such a model is that news sources on the opposite side of the intolerant users attract more flags. We extend the base model in two ways: (i) by allowing news sources to find the path of least resistance that leads to a minimization of backlash, and (ii) by allowing users to change their tolerance level in response to a perceived lower tolerance from users on the other side of the spectrum. With these extensions, in the model we see that intolerance is attractive: news sources are nudged to move their polarity to the side of the intolerant users. Such a model does not support high-tolerance regimes: these regimes are out of equilibrium and will converge towards empirically-supported low-tolerance states under the assumption of partisan but rational users.

10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101805,a novel pixel's fractional mean-based image enhancement algorithm for better image splicing detection,"Image manipulation has become widely accessible to the masses over the past years due to the sophisticated image editing tools which are readily-available and easy to use. As a result, image forgery has increased such that it has become infeasible to discriminate authentic from tampered images with the naked eye. Image forgery plays a prominent role in the spread of misinformation, which might be criminalized under certain jurisdictions. Image splicing is a common type of image manipulation and constitutes one of the most widespread image tampering methods on the internet. Efforts have been made to tackle the implications of image forgery by developing computer algorithms that can discriminate tampered images, however, more research is needed to keep up with the advancements of image editing tools. Previously, we have explored fractional calculus in other image processing applications. In this study, we propose a novel pixel's fractional mean (PFM) algorithm to enhance images prior to classification for better detection of image splicing forgery based on texture features. The proposed PFM enhances each pixel separately depending on the occurrence number of the pixel's intensity. Two sets of texture algorithms are used to extract essential features from suspected spliced images. These features are then used with the “support vector machine” (SVM) classifier to classify authentic and spliced images. The proposed model demonstrated an accuracy rate of 97% when evaluated with the publicly-available image splicing dataset “CASIA v2.0”. With a relatively low dimension feature vector, the proposed model demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency, which corroborate the benefit of using fractional calculus in image processing algorithms. © 2021 The Author(s)",
10.3389/fpos.2022.648061,racialized pandemic: the effect of racial attitudes on covid-19 conspiracy theory beliefs,"As national and international health agencies rushed to respond to the global spread of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as COVID-19), one challenge these organizations faced was the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus. Troublingly, much of the misinformation was couched in racialized language, particularly regarding the source of the virus and responsibility for its spread, fostering the development of related conspiracy theories. Media coverage of these conspiracy theories, particularly early on in the pandemic, had negative impacts on individuals' engagement in protective behaviors and concern with the spread of COVID-19. From extant work, racial resentment and white identity have been shown to be deeply woven into the fabric of contemporary American politics, affecting perceptions of public opinion even after accounting for social and political identities. While racial attitudes have been less studied in relation to conspiracy theory belief, we expect racial resentment and white identity to affect compliance with public health behaviors and COVID-19 conspiracy theory belief. Using observational and experimental survey data (N = 1,045), quota-sampled through Lucid Theorem (LT) in the spring of 2020, we demonstrate that framing the virus in racialized language alters endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, contingent upon levels of racial resentment and white identity and find that higher levels of conspiracy theory belief decreased compliance with preventative measures.

NA,disinformation as a widespread problem and vulnerability factors toward it: evidence from a quasi-experimental survey in spain,"In recent years, several institutions have alerted the effects of information disorders while struggling to handle the problem effectively. Our investigation triangulates between qualitative and quantitative approaches: on the one hand, focus groups adapted to the digital landscape (which many have hinted is an environment naturally favoring disinformation) were used; on the other, a quasi-experimental survey was conducted with 4,351 stratified respondents. The results provide evidence-based data that both confirm the widespread nature of vulnerability—more than half of the Spanish population presents a relevant degree of vulnerability toward disinformation—and spot specific groups that may require targeted actions to ease the effects of information disorders. © 2022 (Roberto Gelado-Marcos, Plácido Moreno-Felices, and Belén Puebla-Martínez).

Objective: This study endeavored to elucidate COVID-19 information needs and information-seeking behaviors of cardiovascular patients hospitalized in the hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted using content analysis in 2020. The population was 17 cardiovascular patients referred to the Shahid Chamran Hospital of Isfahan, who were selected using the purposive sampling method. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed through continuous thematic analysis. Results: The findings showed four categories and ten sub-categories as follows: information needs (general information regarding COVID-19, prevention methods, and treatment methods), information resources (reliable information resources and unreliable information resources), information validation (using formal and informal resources), and information-seeking barriers (media-related, political, economical, and COVID-19-related barriers). Conclusion: Cardiovascular patients are in serious need of awareness-raising concerning COVID-19 to take care of themselves. This study’s results could help health education policy-makers of Iran pinpoint the information needs of high-risk patients and provide these patients access to reliable information while preventing damages due to misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

10.1080/02691728.2022.2052994,climate change and culpable ignorance: the case of pseudoscience,"Moral philosophers, when arguing in favor of curbing climate change, tend to take for granted that ignorance about climate change is culpable. Existing data on knowledge and beliefs on climate change, however, show a concerning amount of false beliefs. Few studies have investigated the culpability of those who exhibit ignorance about climate change. As a result, this paper focuses on ignorance about climate change arising from encounters with pseudoscience. In this paper, we will present the extant data relating to climate change, which shows how distinguishing between science and pseudoscience may pose a challenge to the untrained eye. We will apply the existing theories on epistemic responsibility to the case of ignorant agents who encounter pseudoscience. We will first focus on the conditions that make their ignorance culpable, by referring to epistemic vices. Afterwards, we will explore the conditions for being excused, by analyzing the infosphere that surrounds climate change. We will argue that, in topics like climate change, there is a significant effort from interested parties in producing and disseminating hard-to-detect pseudoscience and disinformation. This significantly influences the attribution of blame to ignorant agents, as epistemically virtuous persons might end up with false beliefs without being blameworthy for them. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
NA,the search for agreement on logical fallacy annotation of an infodemic,"We evaluate an annotation schema for labeling logical fallacy types, originally developed for a crowd-sourcing annotation paradigm, now using an annotation paradigm of two trained linguist annotators. We apply the schema to a variety of different genres of text relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our linguist (as opposed to crowd-sourced) annotation of logical fallacies allows us to evaluate whether the annotation schema category labels are sufficiently clear and non-overlapping for both manual and, later, system assignment. We report inter-annotator agreement results over two annotation phases as well as a preliminary assessment of the corpus for training and testing a machine learning algorithm (Pattern-Exploiting Training) for fallacy detection and recognition. The agreement results and system performance underscore the challenging nature of this annotation task and suggest that the annotation schema and paradigm must be iteratively evaluated and refined in order to arrive at a set of annotation labels that can be reproduced by human annotators and, in turn, provide reliable training data for automatic detection and recognition systems. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.",

They also tend to rely on their false beliefs when asked to justify why they think governments are not being transparent about the pandemic. Our findings suggest that the inability to successfully debunk misinformation could worsen perceptions of government transparency, further eroding political support and contributing to non-compliance with public health directives. © 2022, The authors.",

This study explores how we can use psycholinguistic and computational linguistic processes linked to deception and cybercrime to generate models for detecting deception and text-based disinformation. The study attempts to establish whether there is a similarity in patterns of deception between text-based disinformation and other forms of text-based cybercrime like scams, deceptive online reviews, and fraud. We generated singleton and hybrid models to detect deception and text-based disinformation. The singleton models are trained on fraud, scams, favorable online reviews, and unfavorable online reviews. On the other hand, to generate the hybrid models we combined a disinformation train set to each of the singleton models. When evaluating our models we only considered models whose accuracies for detecting both deceptive and truthful instances were over 50%. Comparatively, there were more hybrid models which detected deception and text-based disinformation with predictive accuracies ranging from 60% to 100%. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Alongside benefits of the app come a slew of dangerous outcomes, such as the proliferation of misinformation on the chat-based app. To this end, we conducted 19 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with Indian users of WhatsApp over the age of 40. The aim of study was to examine how WhatsApp users engage with the platform and the content they access through it in order to mediate through political polarization at an already divisive time.” Our results yielded three overarching themes: First, participants rarely engage in accuracy determination tactics. Second, they expressed familiarity with politically polarizing content but claimed not to engage with it. Third, they expressed intense hopes for future effective content moderation on WhatsApp. By applying cultivation theory to these insights, we examine how the app creates a reality for its users based on media socialization and the truth effect.

10.1177/09610006221142032,"information literacy, well-being, and rural older adults in a pandemic","Many older adults residing in rural communities faced particularly damaging consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Given the impact of the pandemic on the ability to rely on traditional forms of information (i.e. interpersonal communication), reliance on digital technology and other non-traditional sources of information grew. Those who lacked the information literacy, defined in this study as the ability to find and evaluate the reliability of information to address an information need, may have faced psychologically damaging consequences caused by the proliferation of misinformation and information poverty. Informed by an ecological understanding of human information behavior, this paper reports on the findings of a study of rural older adults’ information literacy skills and sense of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. A mail survey, based on concepts from psychology and information science and question wordings adapted from the 2021 Health and Retirement Survey and Jones-Jang et al.’s study of literacies and fake news, was distributed in the summer of 2021 to older adults living in rural Kansas. About 206 valid responses to the survey were received. These were analyzed using correlation and regression testing. The findings indicate a significant relationship between information literacy skills and one’s overall sense of well-being. Personal (age, gender, health, life control), economic (employment, finances), and social-relational resources (social engagement, relationship quality) all were shown to relate positively to information literacy skills. These findings provide definition to our understanding of the importance of information literacy in modern understandings of psychological well-being. © The Author(s) 2022.",

We describe results from randomized experiments in the United States (n = 5,075) that allow us to measure the effects of factual corrections on false beliefs about the vaccine and vaccination intent. Our evidence makes clear that corrections eliminate the effects of misinformation on beliefs about the vaccine, but that neither misinformation nor corrections affect vaccination intention. These effects are robust to formatting changes in the presentation of the corrections. Indeed, corrections without any formatting modifications whatsoever prove effective at reducing false beliefs, with formatting variations playing a very minor role. Despite the politicization of the pandemic, misperceptions about COVID-19 vaccines can be consistently rebutted across party lines.  © 2022 The Author(s).",

NA,‘we cannot trust everything on social media’ — personal experiences and social media literacy skills in fighting fake news during covid-19,"Throughout the pandemic, social media has been a critical avenue for users to obtain and share news. While social media is viewed as a critical tool for the public to obtain information about COVID-19, there is also a need to examine how information is shared and distributed by the public. With the Internet, misinformation can be easily shared by many people, particularly during a pandemic. To combat fake news, it is critical to understand the level of knowledge and media literacy among Malaysian youth, who account for the majority of Internet users. In this research, we explore the experience and social media literacy skills among youths aged 18–34 years old and their ability to refute fake news about COVID-19. To achieve these objectives, in-depth interviews with 10 social media users who are active in seeking and sharing information or news related to COVID-19 was conducted using an online platform and phone calls. This paper argues that despite the high risk of encountering fake news on social media, youths in this study perceived social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as an important tool of information for COVID-19. They also believed fake news can be combated by having important media literacy skills, especially when verifying news. Our findings show that most of the participants chose to cross-check the information related to COVID-19 by referring to reliable and official sources such as the National Safety Council (NSC), the Ministry of Health’s sebenarnya.my portal, and well-established news outlets like Astro Awani. The findings of this study are significant as they shed light on how youths perceive social media literacy and fake news, as well as the social media literacy skills used to combat fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic. © SEARCH Journal 2022.",
NA,sharing truths about the self: theorizing news reposting on social media,"Research indicates that social media users pay limited attention to accuracy when reposting news. If users do not primarily repost to transmit accurate information, what other purpose does this activity serve? This article contributes to the theorization of news sharing by exploring seven affordances enabled by social media’s reposting features, namely visibility, scalability, persistence, association, meta-voicing, interactivity, and immediacy. Taken together, beyond facilitating the spreading of information, these affordances render reposting an effective means for self-presentation similar to Harry Frankfurt’s notion of bullshit. Like bullshitters, reposters are principally concerned with presenting an image of themselves. However, unlike bullshitters, reposters can be deterred by a post’s inaccuracy. Still, because the social media context draws users’ attention to interpersonal connections, accuracy is often not top of mind when making reposting choices. Thus, as platforms no longer serve only social objectives but have also become integral news sources, what is being communicated primarily for self-presentation purposes may inadvertently be perceived for its informational value. Ultimately, this functional context collapse contributes to the (unintended) spreading of misinformation through individual reposting. © 2022 (Jueni Duyen Tran).

Therefore, the world of the internet has become a very hard place to be able to figure out what information available is factual or not. Recently aggressors of this have been sources publishing articles as real news to sway people to behave a certain way. By training a program to identify what is the difference between a factual piece of writing and the nonfactual, consumers would be able to better navigate the political, spiritual, and physical world around them better informed than they otherwise might have been. In this research, the experiment takes a piece of writing and decodes what words were used and compares its previous learning to find out if the words used lead, it to know that something is nonfactual. It then comes up with a percentage based on that and other smaller details like punctuation to determine the result of the report detailing its factuality percentage based on the machine's findings. The purpose of this research is to help people have a better knowledge of which news sources are the most reliable to be able to make smarter decisions on what to believe in this era of misinformation.

Yet the empirical record includes instances where corrective messages do and do not work, even on similar issues. Despite intense scholarly attention to this topic, it remains unclear when people will revise false beliefs. Our study examines a factor with a long history in the study of public opinion: the importance a person attaches to an issue. The subjective state of issue importance has complex effects. It can increase an individual’s motivation to engage in effortful information processing while also leading them to defend existing beliefs and opinions. In a series of experiments administered in national surveys, we examine whether issue importance is implicated in the failure to correct false beliefs. The analyses show that on the topic of GM foods, the effects of a corrective message are smallest among misinformed people who rated the issue as personally important. By contrast, framing GM foods in terms of partisan identity engendered little resistance to a corrective message. Our findings illustrate the value of adopting a broader perspective on misinformation because people may resist corrections for reasons that are unrelated to their partisanship. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Across three experiments, 831 adults answered questions about a mock crime and rated their confidence in each response. Participants gave their confidence immediately after each response or at the end of the memory test. The timing of the confidence judgment did not affect the confidence–accuracy relationship, and the confidence– accuracy relationship remained strong even when participants encoded the event under poor visibility conditions. When participants were unknowingly exposed to misinformation, however, the confidence– accuracy relationship was substantially weakened—participants became highly over-confident in the accuracy of their memories.

Although, the trend of actively using the Internet for seeking health-related information was already on the rise, it accelerated soon after the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with the increased use of the Internet for health decisions, serious concerns have been raised due to fake or misinformation. This study aims to determine the impact of Internet use for gathering health-related information on the disease management behavior of patients and to identify the mediating role of perceived credibility of online information. The study surveyed 200 chronic disease patients with diabetes and hypertension from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, Pakistan. It is concluded that overall health-related Internet use has a positive impact on the disease management behavior of chronic disease patients. The study further confirms the mediating role of the perceived credibility of online information. Patients who are frequent users of the Internet for health information, who perceive online information more credible, reported better disease management behavior as compared to the less frequent users and those who perceive online information less credible. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1017/S0007123420000198,political knowledge and misinformation in the era of social media: evidence from the 2015 uk election,"Does social media educate voters, or mislead them? This study measures changes in political knowledge among a panel of voters surveyed during the 2015 UK general election campaign while monitoring the political information to which they were exposed on the Twitter social media platform. The study's panel design permits identification of the effect of information exposure on changes in political knowledge. Twitter use led to higher levels of knowledge about politics and public affairs, as information from news media improved knowledge of politically relevant facts, and messages sent by political parties increased knowledge of party platforms. But in a troubling demonstration of campaigns' ability to manipulate knowledge, messages from the parties also shifted voters' assessments of the economy and immigration in directions favorable to the parties' platforms, leaving some voters with beliefs further from the truth at the end of the campaign than they were at its beginning.

NA,"twitter and endorsed (fake) news: the influence of endorsement by strong ties, celebrities, and a user majority on credibility of fake news during the covid-19 pandemic","Focusing on a widespread COVID-19 conspiracy theory, this study examines how social endorsement systems on Twitter, represented by retweets and metrics indicating the number of engagements by others, affect assessment of credibility of (fake) news. Expanding studies on social influence and endorsement-based heuristics, we hypothesized that Twitter users would consider fake news retweeted by a strong tie and with cues indicating a greater number of likes, comments, and retweets as more credible than news retweeted by a celebrity and without the cues. Through a two-by-two survey experiment among 267 Twitter users, we found evidence to support these hypotheses. We additionally found that the effectiveness of strong ties and celebrities as retweeters varied by users’ perceptions of their attributes and users’ interactions with them. These findings add to the literature of news credibility by demonstrating the effects of endorsements from social media contacts. Our study partly explains how and why fake news and disinformation spread in the networked online environment. We conclude this study by discussing implications for interventions of fake news on social media. © 2022 (Inyoung Shin, Luxuan Wang, and Yi-Ta Lu).

NA,"how ""loco"" is the loco corpus? annotating the language of conspiracy theories","Conspiracy theories have found a new channel on the internet and spread by bringing together like-minded people, thus functioning as an echo chamber. The new 88-million word corpus Language of Conspiracy (LOCO) was created with the intention to provide a text collection to study how the language of conspiracy differs from mainstream language. We use this corpus to develop a robust annotation scheme that will allow us to distinguish between documents containing conspiracy language and documents that do not contain any conspiracy content or that propagate conspiracy theories via misinformation (which we explicitly disregard in our work). We find that focusing on indicators of a belief in a conspiracy combined with textual cues of conspiracy language allows us to reach a substantial agreement (based on Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha). We also find that the automatic retrieval methods used to collect the corpus work well in finding mainstream documents, but include some documents in the conspiracy category that would not belong there based on our definition. © 2022 European Language Resources Association (ELRA).",

However, the support that queer ethnic young people receive from family and community is compromised by homophobic attitudes and behaviors influenced by misinformation, religious beliefs, and cultural practices. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the absence of research on young ethnic queers suggests that little is known about how this group fares in a close and culturally bound ethnic community within a predominantly white society. This in-depth qualitative study of 43 queer ethnic young people examined how community attitudes and behaviors toward queerness impacted their family and community relationships. Gossip, rumors, silence, stigma, and respectability politics resulted in gender silencing and monitoring, rejection, and self-exclusion. These behaviors exacerbated feelings of cultural alienation in a society where ethnic peoples are already racialized and minoritized, and where the lack of support systems compound an unsafe environment for queer ethnic young people. Homonegative attitudes within ethnic communities require education and interventions at the interpersonal as well as communal level. Families need professional support to address their shame toward children’s queerness and to consider the impact of prioritizing the politics of respectability over the wellbeing of their child. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Accurate information has also fallen victim to the pandemic, which has been rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories. The current study investigated Covid-19 deceptions related to employment. With complete anonymity via MTurk, 389 participants from the United States rated their likelihood of deception regarding hypothetical four workplace scenarios. The first set of analyses examined differences between high and low risk of deceptions for each scenario based on participants’ self-appraisals. The largest differences were found for general conspiracy beliefs and affective disorders, specifically major depression and generalized anxiety. The second set of analyses focused across the workplace scenarios on two operationalized groups with Likely-Deceptive (n = 189) vastly outnumbering Likely-Genuine (n = 55). Personal experiences with Covid-19 dramatically increased deceptions. Testing positive for Covid-19 increased the odds of being in the Likely-Deceptive by twelve-fold. Two discriminant models examined cognitive misbeliefs and psychological functioning. When both were combined, depression and Covid-19 misinformation produced the strongest structure coefficients followed closely by general conspiracy beliefs and generalized anxiety. The far-ranging implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.",
10.1017/can.2021.29,"algorithms, manipulation, and democracy","Algorithmic communications pose several challenges to democracy. The three phenomena of filtering, hypernudging, and microtargeting can have the effect of polarizing an electorate and thus undermine the deliberative potential of a democratic society. Algorithms can spread fake news throughout the society, undermining the epistemic potential that broad participation in democracy is meant to offer. They can pose a threat to political equality in that some people may have the means to make use of algorithmic communications and the sophistication to be immune from attempts at manipulation, while other people are vulnerable to manipulation by those who use these means. My concern here is with the danger that algorithmic communications can pose to political equality, which arises because most citizens must make decisions about what and who to support in democratic politics with only a sparse budget of time, money, and energy. Algorithmic communications such as hypernudging and microtargeting can be a threat to democratic participation when persons are operating in environments that do not conduce to political sophistication. This constitutes a deepening of political inequality. The political sophistication necessary to counter this vulnerability is rooted for many in economic life and it can and ought to be enhanced by changing the terms of economic life.  © The Author(s), 2021.",

These divides persist when respondents face financial costs for incorrectly answering questions. This supports a view in which the informational divisions revealed in surveys on COVID-19 are genuine differences of opinion, not artifacts of insincere cheerleading. The implication is that efforts to correct misinformation about the virus should focus on changing sincere beliefs while also accounting for information search preferences that impede exposure to correctives among those holding misinformed views. © 2022, Harvard Kennedy School.

Concurrently, conspiracy beliefs regarding the origin and spread of the disease have become widespread. Engaging in such beliefs can be explained as a form of coping in order to deal with elevated levels of stress. The present study investigated the indirect effects of coping strategies in the association between perceived chronic stress and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs. We report data from an online survey (N = 1,354 individuals: 807 female; 508 male; 8 diverse; 6 not specified; mean age 39.14 years) in German-speaking countries collected between January and March 2021. Our results indicate that people who felt more stressed were more prone to conspiracy beliefs. Coping via acceptance and self-blame was associated with decreased tendencies towards COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, while people who used denial as a strategy were more prone to these beliefs. These findings emphasize the need for stress management interventions and effective coping strategies during times of crisis in order to reduce chronic perceived stress, promote adaptive coping, and ultimately reduce conspiracy beliefs. © 2022, The Author(s).",

Memory operates in an extremely efficient manner, allowing us to recall more pleasant than unpleasant memories and enough detail to reconstruct past experiences with reasonable accuracy. Memory is, however, subject to distortion, the study of which has historically been rooted in interference theory. Interference theory states that the reason we forget is that other memories in long-term memory impair our ability to retrieve the target memory. Memory involves a reconstructive process: It is vulnerable to interference from other experiences, especially from experiences that occur after a to-be-remembered event. This new edition offers updated findings regarding the many factors that can inflate the impact of post-event information, as well as novel findings on the neuroscience behind the reconstructive nature of memory. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Rüdiger F.

The prevalence of misinformation on the internet makes the search for accurate online health information a more complex and evaluative process. This study examined the role of age and neurocognition in credibility evaluations of credible and non-credible health websites. Forty-one older adults and fifty younger adults completed a structured credibility rating task in which they evaluated a series of webpages displaying health information about migraine treatments. Participants also completed measures of neurocognition, internet use, and health literacy. Results suggested that older adults rated non-credible health websites as more credible than younger adults, but the age groups did not differ in their ratings of credible sites. Within the full sample, neurocognition was associated with credibility ratings for non-credible health websites, whereas health literacy was related to the ratings of credible sites. Findings indicate that older adults may be more likely to trust non-credible health websites than younger adults, which may be related to differences in higher-order neurocognitive functions. Future work might examine whether cognitive-based supports for credibility training in older adults can be used to improve the accuracy with which they evaluate online health information. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

The author discusses the reforms as rooted in the Church's identity and mission to evangelize in the fullest sense of the word as understood in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and developed in the subsequent magisterium. The author addresses the toxic environment created by social media, a primary source of misinformation and fearmongering which leads to growing resistance and polarization among some church leaders and faithful. The resistance to accepting Pope Francis's remarkable ecclesial vision for some sectors of the Church revolves around a harmful reaction which Pope St. John Paul II called ecclesial introversion. The unfamiliarity and even strangeness of his Latin American and Jesuit roots and to the legacy of Medellin and the subsequent CELAM gatherings at least partially explain the challenge Francis's bold reforms present fo the global Church. © 2022 Faculdade Jesuita de Filosofia e Teologia.

To investigate this question, 169 mothers were asked to talk with their preschool-age children (Mage = 55 months, SD = 6.15; 90 female) about an earlier nonshared event. Some mothers were instructed to focus on eliciting an accurate account, whereas others were told to talk naturally as in everyday life. Before this conversation, some mothers in each goal condition were exposed to misleading information about what their children experienced. Mothers focused on accuracy exhibited more bias in their conversations than those centered on talking naturally. When later interviewed, children with accuracy-focused mothers made more false reports and recalled less correct details than those with natural-focused mothers. These trends were found even when mothers were not misinformed. The implications of these results for children's eyewitness memory and suggestibility are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",

NA,from believing to sharing: examining the effects of partisan media’s correction of covid-19 vaccine misinformation,"Drawing on social identity theory and politeness theory, this study tested the effects of partisan media’s correction of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on individuals’ message credibility perceptions and news engagement intentions. Based on a between-subjects online experiment in the United States, we found that partisans exposed to ingroup media perceived corrective messages as more credible (marginally) and held higher news engagement intentions than those exposed to outgroup media; nonpartisans rated corrective messages on partisan media as less credible and were less likely to engage than partisans. It also revealed that message credibility mediated the effects of exposure condition on news engagement intentions. Further, the results show that types of risk quantifiers moderated the direct effects of exposure condition on message credibility perceptions and the indirect effects on news engagement intentions via message credibility perceptions.

The current digital context is helping to exacerbate these problems, which represent the two main threats to the public's right to be informed in a constitutional democracy. The current legal-constitutional frameworks to protect the public’s right to information across EU jurisdictions are no longer effective in guaranteeing two elements associated with this fundamental right: the independence of the media and the duty of truthfulness of journalists. As a solution to this problem, a system of transparency of media companies to reinforce these two elements may become a complementary tool to effectively guarantee the right to information. In this context, a number of voluntary transparency systems of news media organizations are emerging in the European Union and the United States to strengthen media independence and editorial credibility. In this article I first describe and compare these systems by using criteria associated with effective transparency policies. Then I identify standards that are common to all the initiatives focusing on news governance and I evaluate how these standards are being already implemented by a sample of five Anglo American media brands that are enjoying the credibility of their users evidenced by the increasing levels of subscription rates. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
NA,a first attempt at unreliable news detection in swedish,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a parallel infodemic has also been going on such that the information has been spreading faster than the virus itself. During this time, every individual needs to access accurate news in order to take corresponding protective measures, regardless of their country of origin or the language they speak, as misinformation can cause significant loss to not only individuals but also society. In this paper we train several machine learning models (ranging from traditional machine learning to deep learning) to try to determine whether news articles come from either a reliable or an unreliable source, using just the body of the article. Moreover, we use a previously introduced corpus of news in Swedish related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the classification task. Given that our dataset is both unbalanced and small, we use subsampling and easy data augmentation (EDA) to try to solve these issues. In the end, we realize that, due to the small size of our dataset, using traditional machine learning along with data augmentation yields results that rival those of transformer models such as BERT. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.",
10.1037/stl0000332,where do neuromyths come from? sources and strength of psychological misconceptions,"Neuromyths are widely believed misconceptions about psychology and brain function (e.g., people can be left-brained or right-brained). Unfortunately, teachers of psychology are likely to instruct many students with preexisting beliefs in neuromyths. Understanding the origins of neuromyths is important, because the source of beliefs may impact not only their strength, but also educators’ abilities to correct them. We investigated whether having a specific memory of learning a neuromyth would relate to strength of belief in the myth. Among a nonuniversity participant pool sample, there was no relationship between remembering the myth’s source and strength of belief. However, in a college student sample, remembering the source of the myth was frequently associated with stronger belief than simply “knowing” the information to be true. K–12 teachers, common sense, and college professors were the most frequently reported sources of neuromyths. Having taken more psychology or neuroscience courses was not related to accuracy of beliefs about brain function in either sample. We discuss implications for students and educators, including specific approaches teachers of psychology can use to prevent and correct students’ neuromyth beliefs. © 2022 American Psychological Association",

As technology progresses, it becomes easier for everyone to access social media, to the point where some news organisations seek to exploit it as a news source. Meanwhile, in order to avoid public panic, it is critical to educate society at a young age about the impact of fake news on social media. The purpose of this study is to explain the purpose of social media usage and to investigate whether the use of social media platforms to disseminate information has increased the spread of fake news in Malaysia, as well as the effect of information disseminated among university students during the COVID pandemic. Social media is well-known for its ease of use, particularly among young people, in sharing and expressing their opinions on domestic and international topics. Using social media has become second nature to us, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the strength of social media, the public's opinion of finding information during a lockdown is quite positive. The study was carried out in a qualitative manner. The researcher gathered all of the data by asking the participants general research questions. The method employed to obtain the results was an in-depth interview. The findings revealed that information disseminated via social media was successful in raising awareness during the pandemic, particularly among university students. According to the findings, certain scientific and technical advancements should benefit the global community rather than be manipulated in order to obtain accurate and true knowledge; society must be astute. False knowledge would have negative repercussions, and society would inevitably exist in a state of deception.

Researchers conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with urban youth in Ethiopia's East-Gojjam district.

The government's self-contradictory rhetoric and practice, the contradiction between religious teachings and scientific messages, and misinformation in social media are factors for the evolved risk beliefs.

Essentialism is the implicit belief that categories of people–those of certain ethnicities or nationalities, for example–have intrinsic, immutable properties, driven by some deep, unobservable, and often deterministic causal essence. There is robust evidence that cross-culturally, both young children and adults sometimes employ an essentialist heuristic when reasoning about cultural traits, and that they see others’ traits as being less mutable than their own. Strikingly, though, cultures vary drastically in the particulars and extent of this cultural essentialism. Thus, it seems clear that cultural input can to some degree either exploit or overwrite a tendency toward cultural essentialism, with language being an especially powerful mechanism. In this paper, I demonstrate ways that language is intentionally used by those with political power to promote essentialist thought and to justify violence. In particular, I highlight use of generic language, ascriptive definitions, and the language of opposites within propaganda. I end with consideration of ways to be responsive to instances of propaganda within our own communities and as global citizens, such as through pro-social repurposing of the linguistic tools that have been used destructively, promoting nuance through the use of differentiated language, and by capitalizing on an intuitive human belief in essential goodness and desire for truth. © Isacoff, Nora M., 2022.",
10.17323/JLE.2021.13371,the language of russian fake stories: a corpus-based study of the topical change in the viral disinformation,"The spread of disinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic is largely associated with social media and online messengers. Viral disinformation disseminated in 2020-2021 was related to a wide range of topics that caused panic among people. Many false narratives emerged and attracted public interest over time, which mainly reflected the general public's utmost belief in these topics. Text mining can be used to analyze the frequencies of keywords and topic-related vocabulary in order to track the changing focus of the public concerning online disinformation. In this paper, we present the results of a corpus-based study of Russian viral fake stories circulating during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. We propose a method for analyzing the central topics and dynamics of topical change in the context of the Russian Covid-19-fake story. In order to accomplish this objective, we make use of a set of tools to extract keywords, count their frequencies and analyze corresponding contexts. We apply these tools to the compiled specialized diachronic corpus of Russian viral false Covid-19-related stories. The obtained data is evaluated to determine the dynamic of topical shifts by tracking the changes in keyword frequencies as well as the use of other high-frequency corpus words. The findings of the work concerning topical fluctuations in the Russian viral Covid-19 disinformation agenda as well as given explanations for the identified drifts in public interest in the topics during the first year of the pandemic can contribute to developing effective strategies for combating the spread of fakes in the future. © 2021 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

A ‘Concurrent Verbal Protocol and Retrospective Debriefing’ interview happened with the teacher approximately one month later. Six teachers and thirty-six pupils participated altogether. Design and method: Three research methods (expert micro-teaching, verbal protocols and retrospective debriefing) were used. Data were video-recorded and managed using NVivo. About fifteen hours of video data were analysed using grounded theory methods. The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. What can be considered evidence is inevitably affected by the researcher’s methodological position. So what constitutes reliable evidence can be contentious. Appropriate criteria for evaluating the grounded theory emerging from this study were used. Interpretivist approaches for investigating conceptual change in school science are necessary to complement positivist literature. This approach, proved successful in other fields, is new to this context. Data were recorded in 2013. Results: Findings are presented as a Pedagogy Analysis Framework which uses the concepts: means (including information, misinformation and disinformation), strategy (on a spectrum from micro-strategies, through tactics to macro-strategies;), ends (physical changes, individual mental changes and group mental changes), and accidents. Conclusions: The method allows teachers to help the researcher understand incidents in video-data that are not evident to any external observer. The framework could help strategic dialogue between teachers, student teachers, mentors, teacher educators, and educational researchers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1002/9781119743347.ch14,"rumoring, disinformation, and contentious politics in the digital age: the case of china and beyond","This chapter offers an original contribution to an alternative understanding of rumor as disinformation in contentious politics, especially in an authoritarian context like the People's Republic of China. It presents a theoretical deliberation on rumor by exploring its ""transmission"" and ""ritual"" aspect. Rumor control, however, may backfire, while rumor communication is increasingly becoming a prominent phenomenon against official control and crackdowns. Rumor dissemination in contemporary China reveals the public's widespread, deeply ingrained discontentment with the authorities' censorship practices. The chapter examines rumor as an ambiguous political accusation in the official discourse, and Chinese people's beliefs and practices in relation to the spreading of rumors on digital platforms in several cases. Studies of rumor and disinformation traverse across different historical periods, societies, and cultures. The chapter provides the findings to general issues in the study of the contentious aspect of rumor and disinformation in the digital age. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
10.1016/j.jarmac.2021.08.001,double misinformation: effects on eyewitness remembering,"Eyewitnesses may be exposed to multiple, mutually contradictory pieces of misinformation. In the simplest case of double misinformation, an original detail is targeted by misinformation A and then by misinformation B, which contradicts A. In such situations, two separate mechanisms may produce opposite effects on eyewitness remembering: (1) multiple chances to be misled enhance the misinformation effect and (2) noticing contradictions between multiple pieces of misinformation undermines credibility and decreases the effect (all relative to the effect of a single piece of misinformation). Across three experiments, we found support for both of these effects and confirmed an important moderating factor in an item analysis: The first mechanism dominates at low levels of misinformation (encoding and subsequent) availability, and the second at high levels (as this facilitates noticing contradictions). This means that, ironically, more misinformation can be less effective (in terms of distorting eyewitness memory or factual knowledge) if it contradicts itself © 2021.

10.1016/j.pubrev.2021.102105,examining characteristics of prebunking strategies to overcome pr disinformation attacks,"In 2020, Twitter launched a new strategy dubbed ‘prebunking’ in hopes of pre-emptively countering false information about voting by mail and election results. Prebunking was touted as a potential solution; however, little empirical research has tested the strategy to examine its effectiveness towards disinformation in the realm of public relations. Exploring PR-based disinformation attacks as a paracrisis, the purpose of this online quasi-experimental design study (N = 965) was to investigate the effects of an attack and how prebunking strategies, grounded in inoculation theory, can protect organizational outcomes (i.e., reputation and credibility) by interweaving positive psychology. In addition to examining effects on attitudinal components, this study also inspected dimensions of social amplification to determine if prebunking messages can thwart the spread of disinformation via Facebook. Findings provide insight into advancing the conceptual framework of proactive disinformation responses for crisis communication by demonstrating the success of using prebunking with autonomy support and explicit details to thwart adverse effects of disinformation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",

Federal civil servants whose work contradicted Trump administration ideology were sidelined, the administration introduced a new employment category that would seriously weaken civil service protections, and government at all levels now functions in an environment of widespread public belief in conspiracy theories and nonfactual disinformation. The article describes changes in the political context of the work of public professionals and examines effects on the important role characteristic of administrative neutrality. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.1080/09658211.2021.1917618,resisting misinformation via discrepancy detection: effects of an unaware suspicion cue,"Previous studies have shown that contaminating effects of misinformation can be reduced by consciously raising the awareness of eyewitnesses to the discrepancy between the misinformation and the original information (e.g., Tousignant, J. P., Hall, D., & Loftus, E. F. [1986]. Discrepancy detection and vulnerability misleading postevent information. Memory & Cognition, 14(4), 329–338. doi:10.3758/BF03202511). We tested whether similar effects could be obtained without conscious awareness, by drawing on the metaphor “something smells fishy” linking fishy smells and suspicion (Lee, S. W. S., & Schwarz, N. [2012]. Bidirectionality, mediation, and moderation of metaphorical effects: The embodiment of social suspicion and fishy smells. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 103(5), 737–749. doi:10.1037/a0029708). In a pilot study, we established the replicability and generality of previous findings concerning this metaphorical link. We then examined the effects of the smell-suspicion link on susceptibility to misleading post-event information using the misinformation paradigm. Here, the “something smells fishy” metaphor was used to invoke suspicion and increase discrepancy detection. Forty-eight hours after viewing an event, participants received misinformation in a room sprayed with either a fishy or a neutral smell. As expected, unaware exposure to the fishy smell (compared to the neutral smell) increased discrepancy detection (measured indirectly) and resistance to the contaminating effects of misinformation, eliminating misinformation interference and lowering suggestibility on the final test. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1038/s41598-021-01487-w,dynamics of online hate and misinformation,"Online debates are often characterised by extreme polarisation and heated discussions among users. The presence of hate speech online is becoming increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of more than one million comments on YouTube videos through a machine learning model, trained and fine-tuned on a large set of hand-annotated data. Our analysis shows that there is no evidence of the presence of “pure haters”, meant as active users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate, violent, or hateful language within their opponents’ community. Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart. Finally, we find that the overall toxicity of the discussion increases with its length, measured both in terms of the number of comments and time. Our results show that, coherently with Godwin’s law, online debates tend to degenerate towards increasingly toxic exchanges of views. © 2021, The Author(s).",
10.3758/s13421-021-01255-1,are witnesses able to avoid highly accessible misinformation? examining the efficacy of different warnings for high and low accessibility postevent misinformation,"The reliability of eyewitness memory continues to be an area of concern, particularly in situations that involve conflicting sources of information (e.g., the misinformation effect; Loftus et al., 1978, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 4[1], 19–31). To mitigate the negative effects of misinformation, researchers have examined the efficacy of warnings that highlight the unreliability of postevent information. However, warnings have proven less effective for highly accessible misinformation (Eakin et al., 2003, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 29[5], 813–825). In the present study, we examined the effects of different types of warnings for low accessibility misinformation in a standard single test misinformation paradigm, and highly accessible misinformation in a repeated testing misinformation paradigm (Chan et al., 2009, Psychological Science, 20[1], 66–73). We modeled these warnings after Eakin et al. (2003) to include both general warnings and specific question-by-question warnings. We found that warnings were effective in both types of misinformation paradigms. Additionally, memory accuracy in situations where participants were exposed to misleading information was improved when specific and general warnings were combined. We argue that both retrieval blocking of low accessibility items and enhanced contextual discrimination account for these findings. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",

The Brazilian media landscape shows a high concentration of audience and property, lack of transparency, and economic, political and religious interference. This chapter aims to identify features and patterns in the content shared that reveal narratives developed by the Bolsonaro campaign to win the Brazilian presidential election. In Brazil and in India, WhatsApp groups were used to bypass mainstream media and speak directly to citizens, spreading disinformation and polarizing voters along moral and religious lines. The difficulties in debunking disinformation campaigns and determining content credibility, especially for users, can have detrimental effects on democracy. The chapter considers that WhatsApp's affordances create the socio-technical conditions for audience fragmentation and microtargeting strategy. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
10.1177/00027642211003156,cascading crises: society in the age of covid-19,"The tsunami of change triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed society in a series of cascading crises. Unlike disasters that are more temporarily and spatially bounded, the pandemic has continued to expand across time and space for over a year, leaving an unusually broad range of second-order and third-order harms in its wake. Globally, the unusual conditions of the pandemic—unlike other crises—have impacted almost every facet of our lives. The pandemic has deepened existing inequalities and created new vulnerabilities related to social isolation, incarceration, involuntary exclusion from the labor market, diminished economic opportunity, life-and-death risk in the workplace, and a host of emergent digital, emotional, and economic divides. In tandem, many less advantaged individuals and groups have suffered disproportionate hardship related to the pandemic in the form of fear and anxiety, exposure to misinformation, and the effects of the politicization of the crisis. Many of these phenomena will have a long tail that we are only beginning to understand. Nonetheless, the research also offers evidence of resilience on several fronts including nimble organizational response, emergent communication practices, spontaneous solidarity, and the power of hope. While we do not know what the post COVID-19 world will look like, the scholarship here tells us that the virus has not exhausted society’s adaptive potential. © 2021 SAGE Publications.",

Many of the same individuals who deny the scientific consensus on climate change are nevertheless directly impacted by the climate crisis and environmental disasters. In fossil fuel dependent locations, do people continue to deny the scientific consensus on climate change and distrust climate scientists even after themselves experiencing a catastrophic flood? This paper investigates this question through interviews with 40 people affected by the 2013 Southern Alberta Flood, the costliest flood in Canadian history, who also live in the City of Calgary, the economic hub for Canada’s tar sands. Results indicate the participants rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, voiced a distrust in the motivations of climate scientists, though hoped they would one day discover the ‘truth’, and worked discursively to protect the oil industry. The findings reveal the complexity of post-disaster environmental views and trust in science, as well as how fossil fuel dependence shapes these views. © 2021 The Author(s).

10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08132,reactions to the media coverage during the first wave of covid-19 in bangladesh,"Background: The news media play a critical role in disseminating accurate and reliable information during an outbreak like COVID-19, especially in LMICs. Studying how people react and reflect on the information provided and how it affects their trust in health systems is essential for effective risk communication. This study was undertaken to explore and analyse newspaper readers’ reactions to the unfolding news of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and how this affected and shaped their compliance with the mitigation measures advised by the Government. Methods: We collected readers’ comments on relevant news and features on the COVID-19 outbreak (n ¼ 1,055) which were posted in the online versions of the four top circulating Bangla newspapers and one online news portal published during Jan.–Apr. 2020. A search protocol was developed and a team of three researchers searched and extracted data for content analysis according to some pre-determined study themes. Results: Data analysis revealed several characteristics with implications for risk-communication: a faith-based and fatalistic attitude to the unfolding pandemic, a “denial” syndrome in the initial stage, a returning expatriatebashing for specific countries, and a concern about the safety of the frontline health workers. The readers were resentful of the all-pervasive corruption in the health sector even in times of a pandemic and the Government's poorly coordinated, fragmented, and delayed COVID-19 response. The pandemic severely shook their trust in the already weak health system and perceived it to be incompetent, corrupt, and non-responsive. They had deplorable personal and family experiences while seeking treatment for COVID-19 patients. Expert committees were formed to advise the Government, but few recommendations were implemented on the ground. This helpless scenario made people sharply critical of the political leadership, especially for the failure of providing stewardship at the moment of crisis. Conclusions: The COVID-19 related information reaching the people, including misinformation, disinformation, and rumours was equivocal in the early months of the pandemic and failed to build the trust and transparency that is necessary for an inclusive response across constituencies. The Government should pay attention and weightage to people's perceptions about its COVID-19 response and take appropriate measures to re-build trust for implementing pandemic control measures © 2021 The Author(s).

Online disinformation exerts influence at the individual level as well as in public opinion, public discourse, and political decision-making. The hierarchical cluster analysis revealed an agreement with Hallin and Mancini's model and its applicability when examining the phenomenon of disinformation. In contexts with social polarization and fragmented media systems, fact-checking journalism emerges, with limited effect and limited global implementation to combat disinformation and misperceptions. The chapter highlights three implications relevant to understanding the phenomenon of disinformation. First, the analysis features the vulnerabilities of Latin American countries that are similar to Mediterranean European countries. Second, the Latin American political environmental factors explain considerable gaps in comparison with Northern European and central European countries, which are the more resilient cluster.

10.1002/acp.3883,can clarifying instructions mitigate the effects of multifaceted questions on susceptibility to suggestion?,"When cross-examining witnesses, lawyers will sometimes use complex questions to “trip-up” witnesses and thus cast doubt on their testimony. Extending prior research, the present study showed that multifaceted test questions (which contain both a true and false proposition) reduced accuracy for both misled and control participants but had a disproportionate impact on the former. Although misled participants accurately rejected blatant suggestions when tested with simple questions, there was a two-fold increase in false assents when multifaceted questions were used (Experiment 1). Providing participants with explicit instructions on how to respond to multifaceted questions (i.e., respond “yes” only if all parts of the question are true) improved accuracy slightly but did not mitigate the magnitude of the misinformation effect (Experiment 2). Collectively, the results underscore the importance of assessing eyewitness suggestibility in contexts that mimic those witnesses are likely to encounter in the real world. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",
10.1111/ajps.12616,american politics in two dimensions: partisan and ideological identities versus anti-establishment orientations,"Contemporary political ills at the mass behavior level (e.g., outgroup aggression, conspiracy theories) are often attributed to increasing polarization and partisan tribalism. We theorize that many such problems are less the product of left-right orientations than an orthogonal “anti-establishment” dimension of opinion dominated by conspiracy, populist, and Manichean orientations. Using two national surveys from 2019 and 2020, we find that this dimension of opinion is correlated with several antisocial psychological traits, the acceptance of political violence, and time spent on extremist social media platforms. It is also related to support for populist candidates, such as Trump and Sanders, and beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories. While many inherently view politics as a conflict between left and right, others see it as a battle between “the people” and a corrupt establishment. Our findings demonstrate an urgent need to expand the traditional conceptualization of mass opinion beyond familiar left-right identities and affective orientations. © 2021, Midwest Political Science Association",
10.3390/journalmedia2040037,football misinformation matrix: a comparative study of 2020 winter transfer news in four european sports media outlets,"Mainstream sports media generate a football information overload that sometimes makes it difficult to separate rumours from real news. Accordingly, this paper analyses the level of misinformation in the coverage of the 2020 winter football transfer window in four leading European digital sports media outlets: Marca (Spain), A Bola (Portugal), La Gazzetta (Italy) and The Guardian Sport (Britain). The methodology used was based on the content analysis of hundreds of news pieces and tweets posted on these outlets’ football homepages and Twitter handles over a month. To examine to what extent this coverage may have been speculative, misleading or false, the misinformation matrix developed by the fact-checking organisation First Draft News was employed to classify five different types of inaccuracies in sports reporting. A system was also created to determine how many reported rumours finally turned out to be true, which sources were more reliable and what outlets resulted more accurate. The findings reveal that the four digital media published a larger amount of non-factual content about likely football deals rather than sealed transfers. Speculative reporting prevailed in the coverage of the top teams in each league, on which the media outlets placed the accent, whereas reporting about minor clubs was based more on factual news. © 2021 by the authors.",

The transmissions resorted to disinformation and false statements to disseminate the idea that the Allies were interested in transforming Portugal into a major war theatre. This chapter demonstrates how the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG) adapted its messages to the Portuguese audience, paying particular attention to the country’s colonial possessions that were said to be under threat from the Americans and the British. Based on transcripts of the broadcasts, it discusses how the RRG’s dissemination of fear was countered by other sources perceived to be credible by significant segments of the Portuguese population, demonstrating how credibility was a crucial asset to counter the Nazi transmissions that flattered Salazar while stirring fear in relation to the Allies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

According to the American Psychiatric Association, the majority of African American who have mental illness do not receive the treatment they need to effectively manage their conditions. Barriers impede access to quality care. These barriers include stigma, poverty, distrust of healthcare professionals, deficiencies in the number of culturally competent practitioners, and misinformation (i.e., spiritual/religious beliefs). This results in individuals only seeking care in emergencies. Another factor is institutional racism. Generational trauma impacts how African Americans experience mental distress. All of these contribute to ongoing health disparities within the African American community.

10.3389/fpsyg.2021.666707,mediators and moderators of reinforced self-affirmation as a method for reducing the memory misinformation effect,"The misinformation effect occurs when an eyewitness includes information in his or her account that is incongruent with the event he or she witnessed, and stems from being exposed to incorrect external sources. This is a serious threat to the quality of witness testimony and to the correctness of decisions reached by courts. However, few methods have been developed to reduce the vulnerability of witnesses to misinformation. This article presents such a method, namely, reinforced self-affirmation (RSA), which, by increasing memory confidence of witnesses, makes them less inclined to rely on external sources of information and more on their own memory. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed in three experiments. It was also found that memory confidence, but not general self-confidence, is a mediator of the impact of RSA on misinformation effect (ME), and that contingent self-esteem and feedback acceptance, but not sense of self-efficacy or general self-esteem, are moderators of this impact. It is concluded that RSA may be a promising basis for constructing methods, which can be used by forensic psychologists in real forensic settings. Copyright © 2021 Szpitalak and Polczyk.",
10.1038/s41598-021-95514-5,detection of fake-video uploaders on social media using naive bayesian model with social cues,"With the rapid development of the Internet, the wide circulation of disinformation has considerably disrupted the search and recognition of information. Despite intensive research devoted to fake text detection, studies on fake short videos that inundate the Internet are rare. Fake videos, because of their quick transmission and broad reach, can increase misunderstanding, impact decision-making, and lead to irrevocable losses. Therefore, it is important to detect fake videos that mislead users on the Internet. Since it is difficult to detect fake videos directly, we probed the detection of fake video uploaders in this study with a vision to provide a basis for the detection of fake videos. Specifically, a dataset consisting of 450 uploaders of videos on diabetes and traditional Chinese medicine was constructed, five features of the fake video uploaders were proposed, and a Naive Bayesian model was built. Through experiments, the optimal feature combination was identified, and the proposed model reached a maximum accuracy of 70.7%. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Electronic ballots, electronic certified lists, electronic scrutiny, and electronic data are becoming part of the electoral status quo. The digitisation of elections in Australia induces new vulnerabilities that malign foreign entities can exploit to subvert the nation’s democratic sovereignty. Problems such as inauthenticity, data insecurity, and disinformation are amplified in today’s epoch of digital era governance. Since these problems have the potential to erode the legitimacy of Australian elections, it is imperative to deepen understanding of these risks to optimise the nation’s democratic resilience. Through applying a conceptual framework derived from democratic theory and public policy, this paper assesses the vulnerability of Australia’s elections to foreign interference based on the Australian electoral system irrespective of adversary capabilities. It finds that Australia’s federal elections are relatively secure from hard cyber security risks due to digital-analogue hybridity in electoral processes, but they are vulnerable to soft cyber risks such as digital disinformation. © 2021 Australian Institute of International Affairs.",
10.1139/FACETS-2021-0062,the right to burn: barriers and opportunities for indigenous-led fire stewardship in canada,"Indigenous fire stewardship enhances ecosystem diversity, assists with the management of complex resources, and reduces wildfire risk by lessening fuel loads. Although Indigenous Peoples have maintained fire stewardship practices for millennia and continue to be keepers of fire knowledge, significant barriers exist for re-engaging in cultural burning. Indigenous communities in Canada have unique vulnerabilities to large and high-intensity wildfires as they are predominately located in remote, forested regions and lack financial support at federal and provincial levels to mitigate wildfire risk. Therefore, it is critical to uphold Indigenous expertise in leading effective and socially just fire stewardship. In this perspective, we demonstrate the benefits of cultural burning and identify five key barriers to advancing Indigenous fire stewardship in Canada. We also provide calls to action to assist with reducing preconceptions and misinformation and focus on creating space and respect for different knowledges and experiences. Despite growing concerns over wildfire risk and agency-stated intentions to establish Indigenous Peoples as partners in wildfire management, power imbalances still exist. The future and coexistence with fire in Canada needs to be a shared responsibility and led by Indigenous Peoples within their territories.

NA,extremist exploitation of the context created by covid-19 and the implications for australian security,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, extremists around the world have to all appearances sought to exploit the disruption to serve their own strategic or ideological means and ends. In order to understand the threat posed by such extremists in the Australian national security context, this study investigates how extremists incorporated contemporary events in Australia and beyond its borders into their COVID-19-related narratives. This article traverses three ideological milieus and examines violent Salafi-Jihadism, the extreme right, and the extreme left. By studying how ideological milieus interact with the current pandemic context, it is possible to observe the fluctuation of ideological constructs through the identified narratives. These narratives were not solely propagated online as may have been expected: instead, there was observable offline dissemination as well. While little was found on the extreme left, this study found that violent Salafi-Jihadist and extreme-right milieus interpreted COVID-19 in ideologically self-serving ways. In some cases, COVID-19 was used to buttress existing narratives, while there was also evidence of narrative diversification, with seemingly ideologically contradictory positions adopted. These impact national security in Australia in three ways: first, buttressing may reinforce extremist distrust of authorities and cement positions; second, diversification complicates the threatscape by challenging efficient identification; third, the co-optation of idiosyncratic conspiracies has exposed the vulnerability of democratic societies to misinformation. © 2021,Perspectives on Terrorism.

10.1007/s10612-020-09514-4,anatomy of moral panic: the “list of 88” and runaway constructionism,"This article explores a high-profile review of cases of alleged historical investigatory police bias in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, referred to in The New York Times article, “When Gangs Killed Men for Sport: Australia Reviews 88 Deaths.” The title of the article contains the terms of a well-known feature of moral panic—a discovered crime fact and demand for an enforcement response disproportionate to the fact. Our analysis explores the response to the review of the list of cases, Strike Force Parrabell, as an illustration of runaway constructionism. Demand group-interest in the positive designation of the cases (as bias crime) was a means of acknowledging the prejudicial conduct of police during a time of wider attitudinal change. In spearheading the verification of this list of cases, demand groups and crusaders placed a high semiotic burden beyond its capacity as a comparable objective measure. The fitness of the list of 88 cases as a totem for police and societal wrongdoing requires evidence regarding disproportionality based on valid and reliable measures. Despite worldwide interest in NSW for its comparative high ranking in gay bias homicides, however, such ranking does not exist. Nonetheless, despite the impossibility that it stands in as proof of decades long prejudice, corruption or criminal negligence, the list of cases appears to do so anyway. As such, it is illustrative of the occupation of media frames and formats by weak data or of the runaway character of crime stories in an era of “fake news.”. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",
10.1386/jammr_00032_1,digital communication and ramadan at the time of covid-19,"COVID-19 has presented both a health and an information risk with the viral spread of sometimes partial, false or erroneous news. In the Arab region, the media spheres have been saturated with information regarding coronavirus news. From social and traditional media, Arab audiences have been bombarded with a plethora of information, some of which was confusing and contradictory. As coronavirus sweeps across the world, many questions have been raised about the possibility of practicing the rites of the month of Ramadan and to observe fasting by Muslims. With the multiplication of the responses from medical staff, doctors of the law and political representatives, COVID-19 has simultaneously become a health, reli-gious, political and ethical problem for the Muslim world. The premise elaborated so far calls for an in-depth research on the return of news on the official Facebook pages of three online magazines during the coronavirus emergency. The research carries out a qualitative media content analysis of all the news published by three digital ethnic newspapers: The Muslim News (United Kingdom), the Saphir News (France) and the Daily Muslim (Italy). The magazines have undertaken to stem the spread of fake news by offering users data and updates on COVID-19, proposing themselves as authoritative voices and reliable sources of informa-tion. Ramadan turns out to be a very central element in the three magazines in different measures, since it is an issue that becomes more and more urgent for the Muslim community as the weeks go by. The centrality of the religious element in the information flows is in line with the centrality of Islam in the individual and community life of the faithful. The health and religious emergency were narrated together providing updates on the daily measures to be put in place. Individuals have been called to face the health emergency stimulated by their sense of respon-sibility towards others also through religious principles. Social media have played an important role from religious, cultural and social points of view in one of the most important moments of the year for the Islamic community. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

To help citizens, these entities have developed a wide range of actions that range from online seminars, to learning how to evaluate the quality of a source, to video tutorials or the creation of repositories with resources of various natures. To identify the most common media literacy practices in the face of fake news (news that conveys or incorporates false, fabricated, or deliberately misleading information), this exploratory study designed an ad hoc analysis sheet, validated by the inter-judge method, which allowed one to classify the practices of N = 216 libraries from all over the world. The results reveal that the libraries most involved in this task are those belonging to public universities. Among the actions carried out to counteract misinformation, open-access materials that favor self-learning stand out. These resources, aimed primarily at university students and adults in general, are aimed at acquiring skills related to fact-checking and critical thinking.

However, skeptics like James Ost question the theoretical underpinnings, highlight inconsistency of empirical findings surrounding the efficacy of such therapy, and warn against unknown drawbacks. Little is known about the impact of the eye movements, a critical component in EMDR, on susceptibility to false memories, and the existing literature is contradictory. We review the literature and present new findings to help tell the story of the effects of eye movements on memory. Taken as a whole, this small body of work suggests that eye movements do not reliably affect susceptibility to misinformation, nor do they appear to enhance memory, but they do seem to increase spontaneous false memories. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1007/978-3-030-91017-4_15,combatting conspiratorial thinking with controlled argumentation dialogue environments,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with an explosion in misinformation, leading to increased interest in methods to combat the failures in critical thinking which make such misinformation so powerful. In combatting misinformation, simply throwing uncontrolled argumentation at the problem is often counter-productive, partially because the means by which people evaluate arguments are highly subject to cognitive biases. Such biases which promote jumping to unwarranted conclusions have been shown to correlate with conspiratorial belief. We consider the use of Controlled Argumentation Dialogue Environments (CADEs) as a means to mitigate cognitive biases which contribute to belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We will discuss Warrant Game (WG) and Warrant Game for Analogies (WG-A), CADEs in which two arguers are presented with a divisive issue and two competing positions on that issue. They then compete by iteratively improving warrants for their arguments and attacking those of their opponents. The warrant, when made explicit, makes it easier to determine key features typically associated with argument strength and may reveal hidden assumptions or fundamental reasoning incompatibilities. By presenting an issue and positions which relate to conspiratorial thinking, CADEs may operate as an educational tool for breaking conspiratorial belief into core values and building cognitive skills. © 2022, The Author(s).",

Nevertheless, as this paper identifies there are potential challenges associated with the use social media, i.e. trust and credibility, misinformation, and digital inequality. This study uses three case studies to analyze the Indonesian government’s messaging strategies on social media for disaster risk communication, while navigating these challenges. Thematic content analysis of Indonesian emergency units’ social media posts during disaster events and of in-depth interviews with the personnel of the government agencies reveal the problematic aspects of the unidirectional top-down pattern of social media disaster risk communication. The messages mainly convey information about situations related to the disasters and government activities in local communities during disasters. Government agencies did not see social media as an appropriate channel for local communities most likely to be impacted or that such communities are shaped by culturally embedded beliefs and who might have limited accesses to the technology. This study suggests that patterns of social media use for disaster risk communication can differ across cultures. The collectivist culture of Indonesian communities has led to the two-step flow of communication model that proposes embracing culture and social capital to build trust, credibility, and overcome digital inequalities. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.",
10.1002/9781119743347.ch6,ideology and disinformation: how false news stories contributed to brexit,"This chapter investigates why the Euromyths persisted despite their repeated and consistent refutation. The durability of the Euromyths despite their continuous disproval seems to indicate that they appealed to existing ideological beliefs. The chapter utilizes Roland Barthes's concept of ""myth"" to analyze how the Euromyth news stories construct a nationalist ideology. The Euromyths spread an ideological ""truth"" while ignoring protestations about their inaccuracy. The assumed agreement sits within the historico-political situation of rising Euroskepticism in Britain around the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. The impact of the Euromyths developed because, as just shown, they link into a long intertextual chain of disparaging media reports about EU regulations and Euroskeptic speeches. The genre of Euromyth news stories is formed by employing the same discursive strategies that could be observed in the bananas story. The disinformation supported and was supported by a Euroskeptic myth through which its impact unfolded. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

Our study examines how the impact of misinformation corrections is moderated by media choice. In our experiment, participants are asked to read a news article published by Fox News or MSNBC, each highlighting the positive economic impact of legal immigration in the United States. While the news content is held constant, our treatment manipulates whether participants are allowed to freely choose a media outlet or are randomly assigned. Our results demonstrate the importance of people’s ability to choose: While factual misperceptions are easily corrected regardless of how people gained access to information, subsequent opinion change is conditional on people’s prior willingness to seek out alternative sources. As such, encouraging people to broaden their media diet may be more effective to combat misinformation than disseminating fact-checks alone. © The Author(s) 2021.",

Participants viewed a video depicting the investigation of a child kidnapping case and subsequently were exposed to suggestions of non-occurrence either once (Experiments 1 and 3) or three times (Experiments 2 and 3). The results provided no evidence that single suggestions of non-occurrence influenced participants’ memories or belief (Experiments 1 and 3). However, in two experiments (E2 and E3) the results provided clear evidence that repeated elaboration of suggestions of non-occurrence led participants to claim that the events they witnessed never happened. The finding that participants were influenced by repeated, but not single elaboration of suggestions of non-occurrence shows that reflective elaboration processes played an important role in leading participants to disbelieve the events they had witnessed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
NA,the science of witness memory: implications for practice and procedure in international arbitration,"Witness evidence plays a lead role in international arbitrations, yet the reliability of witness evidence in arbitral contexts has received little attention from legal practitioners. Hundreds of scientific studies have highlighted the fragile nature of witness memory and the ease with which memories can become unwittingly corrupted. In this article, we explain why the psychological research on witness memory is relevant to international arbitration and outline some of the key findings that have important implications for procedure and practice. Alongside the large body of science illustrating the malleability of witness memory, there exists a substantial amount of research outlining how best to preserve or maximize the quantity and quality of witness evidence. Indeed, many simple measures can be adopted by arbitrators and counsel, when eliciting and presenting witness evidence. When educated on the psychological science concerning the factors that can render even the most meticulous and honest witness prone to error, fact-finders will be in a far better position to assess witness evidence in international arbitrations. © 2022 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands",

It was found that regardless of story framing the majority of responses involved users engaging in debate and discussion rather than sharing personal experiences. Furthermore, stories framed episodically had a greater proportion of both supportive and unsupportive comments than stories framed thematically. As predicted, episodic stories were associated with more attributions of responsibility directed towards the individual whereas thematic stories lead to more societal-level attributions of blame. Contrary to predictions, responses did not contribute towards the stigmatisation of lung cancer, instead more responses were aimed at reducing stigma for this illness. Within the findings strong beliefs about cancer treatment and management were also identified, which raises concern over the spread of misinformation. Overall, this research provided insight into the framing of cancer news and highlighted potential implications of Facebook comments. © The Author(s) 2020.",

Specifically, the role of homophily (“love of same”) was examined in creating politically homogenous social and informational networks that facilitate and amplify polarized perceptions of the election's legitimacy and belief in voter fraud across time. Consistent with our hypotheses, Trump voters’ susceptibility to misinformation about voter fraud and refusals to accept the election results as legitimate drastically increased to the extent to which they were entrenched in politically homophilic networks. Biden voters modestly strengthened their views of the election results as legitimate when entrenched in politically homophilic networks. Moreover, the influence of politically homophilic networks in facilitating this polarization grew stronger with the passage of time. Longitudinal modeling revealed that, among Trump voters, politically homophilic networks decreased perceptions of election legitimacy through increased belief in voter fraud. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues",
10.1073/pnas.2112266118,the role of non-covid-specific and covid-specific factors in predicting a shift in willingness to vaccinate: a panel study,"Although declines in intent to vaccinate had been identified in international surveys conducted between June and October 2020, including in the United States, some individuals in the United States who previously expressed reluctance said, in spring 2021, that they were willing to vaccinate. That change raised the following questions: What factors predicted an increased willingness to inoculate against COVID-19? And, to what extent was the change driven by COVID-specific factors, such as personalworry about the disease and COVID-specific misinformation, and to what extent by background (non-COVID-specific) factors, such as trust in medical authorities, accurate/inaccurate information about vaccination, vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance? This panel study of more than 8,000 individuals found that trust in health authorities anchored acceptance of vaccination and that knowledge about vaccination, flu vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance played a more prominent role in shifting individuals from vaccination hesitance to acceptance than COVID-specific factors. COVID-specific conspiracy beliefs did play a role, although a lesser one. These findings underscore the need to reinforce trust in health experts, facilitate community engagement with them, and preemptively communicate the benefits and safety record of authorized vaccines. The findings suggest, as well, the need to identify and deploy messaging able to undercut health-related conspiracy beliefs when they begin circulating. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

10.1177/01634437211040669,rethinking journalism standards in the era of post-truth politics: from truth keepers to truth mediators,"In this article, we argue for a pragmatic understanding of the role of news media and journalism not as truth keepers but as truth mediators in the public sphere. In the current debate on ‘post-truth politics’ the emphasis is often put on the formulation of ethical guidelines and legal solutions to regain control over ‘unbound journalism’ or to re-establish truth in the news media. Instead of holding journalists individually accountable for the spread of fake news, we consider truth as an unstable outcome of fact-finding, information-seeking and contestation, where journalists act as professional brokers. Journalists are not individuals that are closer to facts or more devoted to truth than others. They are rather embedded in a professional field of journalism practices that help to establish the value of information in a trusted way that becomes acceptable and convincing for the majority. Standards and procedures of journalism can therefore not be applied in a way to detect truth in an absolute way and defend it against falsehood, but to approach truth in the most reliable and acceptable way. The truth value of information then becomes the (unstable) outcome of a democratically necessary procedure of critical debate facilitated by journalists. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0263191,a darkening spring: how preexisting distrust shaped covid-19 skepticism,"Despite widespread communication of the health risks associated with the COVID-19 virus, many Americans underestimated its risks and were antagonistic regarding preventative measures. Political partisanship has been linked to diverging attitudes towards the virus, but the cognitive processes underlying this divergence remain unclear. Bayesian models fit to data gathered through two preregistered online surveys, administered before (March 13, 2020, N = 850) and during the first wave (April-May, 2020, N = 1610) of cases in the United States, reveal two preexisting forms of distrust-distrust in Democratic politicians and in medical scientists-that drove initial skepticism about the virus. During the first wave of cases, additional factors came into play, suggesting that skeptical attitudes became more deeply embedded within a complex network of auxiliary beliefs. These findings highlight how mechanisms that enhance cognitive coherence can drive anti-science attitudes. © 2022 Priniski, Holyoak.

10.1016/j.jarmac.2021.03.006,correcting neuromyths: a comparison of different types of refutations,"Research suggests that educators and students often hold erroneous beliefs about learning and brain function, referred to as neuromyths. The prevalence of these neuromyths may be problematic, leading people to spend resources on ineffective study methods and propagate misinformation. Therefore, we examined whether erroneous beliefs in neuromyths could be corrected using various forms of refutations. Across two experiments, participants viewed true and false statements (neuromyths) about learning and brain function and indicated whether the statements were true or false. Participants then received one of three types of corrections (refutation-only, refutation-explanation, refutation-explanation and image) or no correction (control). One week and 1 month later, participants again indicated their beliefs in the true statements and the neuromyths. Results showed that all three refutations were effective for correcting erroneous beliefs in neuromyths, and this corrective effect was present after 1 week and 1 month. These findings suggest that beliefs in neuromyths can be corrected and possibly lead to long-lasting knowledge revision. © 2021",
10.3390/h10040128,"small revelations, … maybe not even with an apocalyptic tone","This article tries to be funny in a very serious way, following Virginia Woolf’s call in Three Guineas that, in the face of man-made disasters, we may have to make fools of ourselves in relation to common sense. Apocalypses, such as the Anthropocene, climate change, and mass extinction require—like the Second World War that Woolf refused to simplify—a tentative search for knowledge, not controlling and predictable methods in the search for a solution. The article is based on how Jacques Derrida’s discussion with Immanuel Kant regarding how truth should sound before the apocalypse over the years has increasingly come to describe contemporary doxa, within which there is only room for mystagogues, who inaugurate followers in the “real truth” behind “fake news”, or scientisticists, who believe that facts and truth are the same thing. When Derrida shows how these two positions depend on each other, sharing the modern belief that knowledge is associated with development, boundaries and control, he also shows how this narrows knowledge down to the predictable, and, thus, makes it complicit with the mistaken efforts of control responsible for today’s challenges. Against this background, the article analyzes works by the artist, Eva Löfdahl, and links them with questions concerning connections between truth, knowledge, art, and science. © 2021 by the author.",

However, researchers have expressed concern about the willingness of respondents to divulge beliefs in conspiracy theories due to the stigmatization of those ideas. We use an experimental design similar to a list experiment to decipher the effect of social desirability bias on survey responses to eight conspiratorial statements. Our study includes 8290 respondents across seven countries, allowing for the examination of social desirability bias across various political and cultural contexts. While the proportion of individuals expressing belief in each statement varies across countries, we observe identical treatment effects: respondents systematically underreport conspiracy beliefs. These findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs may be more prominent than current estimates suggest.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Some features of internet text differ from that of traditional print, contributing to the challenges of discerning “fake news.” Readers must understand how to navigate online texts to conduct research effectively, while applying critical thinking to determine the reliability of online information. Descriptive data from an ongoing study revealed that children in grades 1–5 lack some basic understanding of how to search the “wild wide web.” Just as children benefit from explicit instruction related to text features, children benefit from instruction related to the features of the internet. This article presents a study of website evaluation that occurs early in the search process prior to the selection of a particular website or article.

NA,the influence of fake news: rebuilding public trust in journalism,"This chapter explores the turbulent environment in which journalists and scholars find themselves today, and the impact of fake news on the credibility of journalism. It addresses current political, social, and cultural issues influencing the practice of media and communication. I argue that fake news in the 21st century is distinguished by the technologies that allow it to mimic legitimate journalism and be disseminated globally without barriers. When unpacking the significance of fake news as it exists today, two elements must be examined: fake news as misrepresentation and fake news as an attack on journalists. The chapter ends with a consideration of journalism can best take on this phenomenon to combat fake news while continuing to engage in ethical practice that upholds long-standing principles and values. Journalists must engage in good reporting that includes multiple viewpoints and supported claims while also honestly critiquing so-called objective journalism.

Our contribution focuses on the Italian case, where the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) was able to act as first mover in its field so as to strategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of a pre-existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows that the activity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily limited to the implementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for the fight against disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that as a political actor in its own right, the Italian media regulator claimed control over sectoral expertise in order to shape the crucial first steps of the response to the infodemic. © The Authors.

In total, 25 young adults aged between 18 and 29 years formed one sample and participated in one of four focus groups. The second sample consisted of 10 industry professionals with backgrounds in policing, corrections, and forensic psychology. Each professional participated in an individual semistructured interview. Both samples were asked questions regarding vulnerability and safety in public, where responses were analyzed using a thematic analysis. Multiple themes were identified and categorized into situational and individual factors associated with victimization. Situational factors referred to aspects of the environment that may influence vulnerability to PSV and included visibility, location, and level of support for potential victims. Individual factors referred to aspects about the person that may influence vulnerability to PSV and included unpredictability, ease of target, stereotypes, in-groups versus out-groups, distractions, and personality traits. Although both samples identified similar situational factors, young adults were found to be either unaware of individual factors identified by industry professionals as influencing vulnerability or at least misunderstood some of these factors. This is problematic as young adults may be basing their public behaviors on misinformation that may in fact increase, rather than decrease, vulnerability to PSV. The findings from this study have implications for the design of personal safety programs as well as community-based interventions to reduce vulnerability, the prevalence of PSV, and the negative outcomes associated with PSV, including anxiety and fear of crime. © The Author(s) 2018.",

This is due to a tendency to discount troubling information while facing the unknown and counter-argue against information that causes discomfort and fear. This tendency helps humans to maintain hope and well-being. The study aimed to determine if Polish citizens tend to downplay or even deny danger when faced with a death threat. The study comprised 58 adults – 46 females 12 males, aged 21 to 49. The participants were asked to answer 12 questions defining their beliefs and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic threat and its consequences. The subjects gave answers on the 5-point Likert scale, from ""definitely not"" to ""definitely yes"". The findings of the present study show that a considerable number of the participants tend to exhibit an optimistic bias. This is reflected in their direct statements and in the lack of congruence of their opinions. They do feel the threat of becoming ill but also seem to believe it need not affect them personally. They are also relatively optimistic about the outcomes of the pandemic. At the same time, they realize that COVID-19 may lead to severe psychological, neurological, and mental disorders. The study confirmed a tendency to deny the threat that can pose a severe risk to health and psychological well-being. This is a manifestation of an optimism bias that has its roots in the way the human brain works. The participants did express concerns about the future but at the same time hoped that life after the pandemic would return to normal. It reflects a benevolent facet of self-deception since it makes it possible to cope with highly threatening and impossible to control events. © 2021, MEDSPORTPRESS Publishing House.

10.1027/1864-1105/a000287,"assessments of user comments with ""alternative views"" as a function of media trust","Comments sections under news articles have become popular spaces for audience members to oppose the mainstream media s perspective on political issues by expressing alternative views. This kind of challenge to mainstream discourses is a necessary element of proper deliberation. However, due to heuristic information processing and the public concern about disinformation online, readers of comments sections may be inherently skeptical about user comments that counter the views of mainstream media. Consequently, commenters with alternative views may participate in discussions from a position of disadvantage because their contributions are scrutinized particularly critically. Nevertheless, this effect has hitherto not been empirically established. To address this gap, a multifactorial, betweensubjects experimental study (N = 166) was conducted that investigated how participants assess the credibility and argument quality of mediadissonant user comments relative to media-congruent user comments. The findings revealed that media-dissonant user comments are, indeed, disadvantaged in online discussions, as they are assessed as less credible and more poorly argued than media-congruent user comments. Moreover, the findings showed that the higher the participants level of media trust, the worse the assessment of media-dissonant user comments relative to media-congruent user comments.

Likewise, retracted news items may spread and persist, despite being publicly established as false. In this article, we explore the dynamics of retraction using agent-based models of epistemic networks, to see why false beliefs might persist despite retraction. We find that, often, those who received false information simply fail to receive retractions because of social dynamics. Surprisingly, delaying retraction can increase its impact. Further, retractions are most successful when issued by the original source of misinformation, rather than a separate source. © 2021 by the Philosophy of Science Association. All rights reserved.",

Negated corrections, which state a piece of information is not true, may only be effective at inhibiting information an observer has already encountered. We compared the effectiveness of negated corrections and replacements while manipulating initial exposure to a target concept. Subjects read one (Experiment 1) or six (Experiment 2) passages presenting a target concept (e.g., blue car) or not, followed by a negated correction (e.g., not blue), replacement (e.g., red), or no correction, then answered open-ended questions which were scored for mentions of the target concept. When subjects were exposed to the target concept, negated corrections reduced mentions of the misinformation relative to no correction; however, when not exposed to the concept, negated corrections increased mentions relative to no correction. These results demonstrate that negated corrections can increase belief in misinformation when observers have not been exposed to the misinformation. © 2021 The Authors.

NA,covid-19: tele-regulation of broadcast coverage of public health emergencies in nigeria,"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has presented a severe challenge to broadcasters globally. How broadcast media stations in Nigeria responded through their coverage is deserving of scholarly attention. How regulatory agencies performed their role during the out of the virus is equally worthy of scholarly attention. Objective: This study assessed COVID-19 coverage by Kano State broadcast media. It also evaluated how the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), an agency saddled with regulating the broadcasting industry, responded in tackling violations during a public health emergency. Methodology: The researchers made use of a mixed-method: content analysis and documentary analysis. Content analysis was used to generate quantitative data, while documentary analysis was used for qualitative data through analysis of the Weekly Monitory Reports (WMRs). Results The paper found that the COVID-19 pandemic was given a third place on public station with 16% coverage and fourth position on a private station with about 15%. On information accuracy, the paper found that there were instances of inaccuracies about the virus as non-experts were severally featured on programmes, thus misleading the public. Conclusion: The paper concludes that Kano broadcasters paid attention to the pandemic but disregarded professionalism in so many instances as inaccuracies and misinformation were reported and acted upon by NBC. It is therefore recommended that NBC should not only amend emergency coverage provisions in the Code but come up with a broadcast policy on disaster and other crises emergencies as an antidote to unprofessional coverage as witnessed in some stations. Unique contribution: The study offered theoretical and practical contribution that explains how broadcasters report health emergency issues in radio stations. Key recommendation: National broadcasting commission should come up with a broadcast policy on disaster and other crises emergencies as a remedy to unprofessional coverage as witnessed in broadcast stations. © 2021, University of Nigeria Department of Mass Communication.

This study explores the predictors of accurate beliefs about COVID-19 and its influence on COVID-related policy and behavior. Methods: Data from an original survey collected by Lucid in July 2020 are used. Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) is used to predict accurate beliefs about COVID-19. Ordered logistic regression models are estimated to examine the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, policy preferences, and health behavior intentions. Results: Ideology and education were found to have a positive effect on knowledge about COVID-19. Moreover, low levels of knowledge about COVID-19 were found to reduce support for mandatory vaccination policy and willingness to get a coronavirus vaccine when available. Conclusion: These findings will help policymakers develop communication strategies for the public on the coronavirus vaccination. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.",

Science denialism doesn’t involve just a rejection of a scientific theory; it also challenges the practice of continuously and impartially testing research methods, theories, and evidential sources with the aim of improving the accuracy of our theories. This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the epistemic mechanisms at work. It develops a fine-grained framework to model a variety of normative deviances that may take place in enquiry. Through analysing two case studies, it is argued that fake news plays two pivotal roles in shaping epistemic norms operating within science denialism. First, it discredits a variety of (institutional) sources of evidence; second, it also plays a part in building the alternative explanation of the target phenomena. © Oxford University Press 2021.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0255785,what you say and what i hear-investigating differences in the perception of the severity of psychological and physical violence in intimate partner relationships,"The correct communication of the severity of violence is essential in the context of legal trials, custody cases, support of victims, etc., for providing fair treatment. A narrator that communicates their experiences of interpersonal violence may rate the seriousness of the incident differently than a rater reading the narrator's text, suggesting that there exist perceptual differences (PD) in severity ratings between the narrator and the rater. We propose that these perceptual differences may depend on whether the narrative is based on physical or psychological violence, and on gender differences. Physical violence may be evaluated as more serious by the receiver of the narrative than by the narrator (Calibration PD), whereas the seriousness of psychological violence may be difficult to convey, leading to a discrepancy in the seriousness ratings between the narrator and the rater (Accuracy PD). In addition, gender stereotypes may influence the seriousness rating (Gender PD), resulting in violence against women being perceived as more serious than the same violence against men. These perceptual differences were investigated in 3 phases using a new experimental procedure. In Phase 1, 113 narrators provided descriptions and seriousness ratings of selfexperienced physical and psychological violence in relationships. In Phase 2, 340 independent raters rated the seriousness of 10 randomly selected narrations from Phase 1. In Phase 3, the genders in the narrations were changed to the opposite gender, and seriousness ratings were collected from 340 different raters. Our results confirmed the hypothesized perceptual differences. Violence to male victims was considerably more likely to be seen as severe when the raters were misled to believe the victim was a woman. We propose that these data provide practical guidelines for how to deal with misinformation in the communication of violence. The data also show that mean values and the confidence of such severity ratings need to be adjusted for several factors, such as whether it is self-experienced or communicated, the type of violence, and the gender of the victims and raters.  © 2021 Sikström et al.

10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101623,influencing climate change attitudes in the united states: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Researchers interested in climate change communication have investigated how people respond to messages about it. Through meta-analysis, the current research synthesizes the multitude of experimental studies on this topic to uncover which interventions are most effective at influencing attitudes about climate change. The meta-analysis focuses on experimental studies that included a control condition and measured climate change attitudes among participants in the United States. After a large literature search, 396 effect sizes were retrieved from 76 independent experiments (N = 76,033 participants). Interventions had a small, significant positive effect on attitudes, g = 0.08, 95% CI [0.05, 0.10], 95% prediction interval [-0.04, 0.19], p < .001. Surprisingly, type of intervention was not a statistically significant moderator of this effect, nor was political affiliation. However, type of attitude was a significant moderator: the treatment-control difference in attitudes was smaller for policy support than for belief in climate change, indicating that policy attitudes are more resistant to influence than belief in climate change. Interventions that aimed to induce skepticism (e.g., misinformation) had a significantly stronger average effect on attitudes than did ones that intended to promote belief in climate change, suggesting that belief in climate change is more easily weakened than strengthened. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",
10.1093/oso/9780198863977.003.00015,"fake news, false beliefs, and the fallible art of knowledge maintenance","The term ‘fake news’, it is argued in this chapter, captures a novel kind of social-epistemic dysfunction that arises from systemic distortions of established processes of creating, disseminating, and consuming news-like content. Navigating informational environments populated by fake news requires the cultivation of epistemic routines that reduce our exposure to misleading and deceptive information, while at the same time continuing to allow us to partake in the collective growth of knowledge. Shifting the focus to epistemic routines steers a middle path between two frequently encountered dichotomous responses to the problem of fake news: viz., between emphasizing the individual’s responsibility to ‘think critically and check one’s sources’ and advocating technological tweaks (such as automated fact-checking). While epistemic agents ought to be held responsible for the epistemic routines they commit themselves to, there is also a collective need for making the predictable effects of such choices transparent to individuals, wherever technologically possible. © Oxford University Press 2021.",

This disease, which has morphed into a global pandemic, has mobilized outrageous outpouring action worldwide. Despite international and local media attention coupled with overwhelming new facts replete with misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 from many channels; including interpersonal and social media, efforts to scale up control measures have yielded mixed results. The government and Kenyan media have reported several cases in which the public and leaders flouted these measures thus putting themselves at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The overarching question is: does fear-arousing communication really matter in behaviour change particularly during a global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19? This qualitative study therefore examined the effects of COVID-19 messages on health behaviour change among residents living in the Municipality of Busia, one of the towns that have recorded the highest incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases as informed by the Extended Parallel Process and Health Belief behavioural change models. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to establish threat and coping appraisal as a result of COVID-19 messages received from different sources. The study employed a risk behaviour diagnosis assessment that focused on two components of health risk messages, that is, threat and recommended response that addresses efficacy issues. This study found out that despite universal knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods, perceived threat especially perceived vulnerability to the virus was low due to misinformation, disinformation and disjointed communication. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.",

In the age of social media, however, there is a growing fear that the circulation of false or misleading claims will be more impactful than ever now that sophisticated technological means are available to those who desire to spread them. Should democratic societies worry about misinformation? If so, is it possible and desirable for them to control its spread by regulating it? This chapter offers an answer to these questions. First, I propose a definition of misinformation and explain how it proliferates in online contexts. Second, I consider four reasons to worry about misinformation by discussing its likely impact on people’s political opinions, emotions, physical safety and personal autonomy. Third, I assess three strategies for regulating misinformation-individual self-regulation, platform-based innovations and governmental action-and suggest that the most effective ones are those that spare human agents from having to successively review individual pieces of content. © 2021 selection and editorial matter Étienne Brown.",

10.1111/csp2.415,"presumed killers? vultures, stakeholders, misperceptions, and fake news","Vultures and condors are among the most threatened avian species in the world due to the impacts of human activities. Negative perceptions can contribute to these threats as some vulture species have been historically blamed for killing livestock. This perception of conflict has increased in recent years, associated with a viral spread of partial and biased information through social media and despite limited empirical support for these assertions. Here, we highlight that magnifying infrequent events of livestock being injured by vultures through publically shared videos or biased news items negatively impact efforts to conserve threatened populations of avian scavengers. We encourage environmental agencies, researchers, and practitioners to evaluate the reliability, frequency, and context of reports of vulture predation, weighing those results against the diverse and valuable contributions of vultures to environmental health and human well-being. We also encourage the development of awareness campaigns and improved livestock management practices, including commonly available nonlethal deterrence strategies, if needed. These actions are urgently required to allow the development of a more effective conservation strategy for vultures worldwide. © 2021 The Authors.

10.1111/spsr.12467,explaining conspiracy beliefs and scepticism around the covid-19 pandemic,"Public opinion on COVID-19 provides new empirical evidence for the debate on the ideological contours of conspiracy theories. I report findings from a web survey in Greece where participants were recruited via paid advertising on Facebook and the study sample was adjusted for age, gender, education, domicile, and region of residence using a nationally representative reference sample. I find that beliefs about conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated with established political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticism about the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political and medical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable has such a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statistical specifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left-right self-placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government. The results have implications for the strategies aimed at fighting disinformation during public health emergencies. © 2021 The Authors.

The risk of misguided trust comes from the fact that re-posting is a kind of credentialing; as a new kind of speech-act, re-posting does not yet have established norms and so runs an additional risk of “bent credentialing.” This chapter proposes that other-regarding epistemic virtues can help us mitigate the epistemic risks that come with re-posting-specifically the virtue of epistemic trustworthiness. It further considers how an epistemically trustworthy person should regulate her re-posting behavior in light of the psychological evidence that retracting false beliefs is far more difficult than might be supposed. Behaving in an epistemically trustworthy way requires being responsive to the real risks that our actions expose others to, as well as recognizing the real ways that others depend on us. © Oxford University Press 2021.",
NA,visual ethics: a matter of survival,"This chapter examines visual ethics as an expanded theory balancing rational and intuitive ways of knowing and decision making and offers guidelines for the ethical practice of visual journalism through the reflective integration of reason and emotion. The chapter briefly reviews approaches to visual ethics theory, renews definitions of visual journalist and visual journalism, assesses the state of visual journalism, and recommends that visual journalists ground their professional ethics in fulfilling their roles as human beings with vulnerabilities and strengths, seers who are compelled to witness and document, and reporters who feel a responsibility to pursue and communicate the best truth they can discern. Photographic examples manifesting aspects of integrated visual ethics are included. The chapter argues that increasing diversity among visual storytellers, practicing engaged journalism, and applying visual ethics, honed by reflection on conscious and nonconscious ways of perceiving and meaning making, will strengthen visual journalism. This will help meet the challenges of fakery, disinformation, and harmful practices that increasingly undermine both ethical practice and user understanding in the 21st-century media environment. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Lada Trifonova Price, Karen Sanders, and Wendy N.

10.1353/ff.2021.0016,"""bizarre"" and ""backward"": saviorism and modernity in representations of menstrual beliefs and practices in the popular media","Popular discourse increasingly addresses cultural and religious beliefs and practices related to menstruation around the world. This article presents a careful textual analysis of eighty-two articles seeking to dispel menstrual myths published in a wide variety of popular online media. While the articles aim to correct misinformation, many lapse into sensationalized or patronizing accounts of menstrual beliefs and practices that disregard and, in some cases, even ridicule cultural and religious tradi-tions. Our analysis reveals that many articles reflect the neocolonial trinity of victim, savage, and savior that cast the global North as progressive and the global South as regressive. Through these representations, assumptions of Western superiority, including the untroubled privileging of modernity, are contrasted with “backward” traditions. In particular, these discursive formulations metaphorically cast women and girls as passive victims of their “savage” culture in need of “saviors” who have the authority and the resources to alleviate their suffering. In doing so, the articles largely fail to understand the complex and diverse meanings of menstrual beliefs and practices and to acknowledge women’s and girls’ agency. © 2021 Feminist Formations,.",

10.3389/fpsyg.2021.716336,false memories in native and foreign languages,"Human memory is prone to memory errors and distortion. Evidence from studies on cognitive functions in bilinguals indicates that they might be prone to different types of memory errors compared to monolinguals; however, the effect of language in false memories is still understudied. Source monitoring processes required for proper memory functioning, presumably, rely on inhibitory control, which is also heavily utilized by bilinguals. Moreover, it is suggested that thinking in a second language leads to more systematic and deliberate reasoning. All these results lead to expect that bilinguals are more analytical when processing information in their second language overcoming some memory errors depending on the language of information. To test this hypothesis, we run a classical misinformation experiment with an explicit source monitoring task with a sample of Russian–English bilinguals. The language of the misinformation presentation did not affect the degree of the misinformation effect between the Russian and English languages. Source monitoring demonstrated an overall higher accuracy for attributions to the English source over the Russian source. Furthermore, analysis on incorrect source attributions showed that when participants misattributed the sources of false information (English or Russian narrative), they favored the Russian source over the not presented condition. Taken together, these results imply that high proficiency in the second language does not affect misinformation and that information processing and memory monitoring in bilinguals can differ depending on the language of the information, which seems to lead to some memory errors and not others. © Copyright © 2021 Dolgoarshinnaia and Martin-Luengo.",

The projection of strategic narratives through disinformation campaigns is an important geopolitical tool in the global competition for power and status. We have analysed close to 1,000 individual news pieces from more than 60 different online sources containing disinformation, which originally appeared in one of the V4 languages, using a natural language processing algorithm. We have assessed the frequency of recurring themes within the articles and their relationship structure, to see whether consistent disinformation narratives were to be found among them. Through frequency analysis and relationship charting, we have been able to uncover individual storylines connected to more than ten overarching disinformation narratives.

Does factual information about immigration indeed affect policy preferences? Are beliefs about immigration’s societal impact the mechanism through which factual information affects support for increased immigration? To address these questions, we conducted an original survey experiment, in which we presented a nationally representative sample of 2,049 Americans living in the United States with facts about immigrants’ English acquisition and immigrants’ impact on crime, jobs, and taxes—four domains with common misperceptions. Three of these factual domains (immigration’s impact on crime, jobs, and taxes) raise overall support for increased immigration. These facts also affect beliefs that are directly relevant to that information. Moreover, those beliefs mediate the effect of factual information on support for increased immigration. By contrast, information about English acquisition affects neither policy preferences nor beliefs about immigration’s impact. Facts can leverage social cognitions to change policy preferences. © 2021 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",

The continued preponderance of neuromyths among educators is of concern, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. Method: Using an adapted questionnaire, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among teachers in a small island developing state in the Caribbean. Results: Two-thirds of the sample were unable to recognise at least 50% of the myths. Regression analysis demonstrated that higher scores in brain knowledge and exposure to prior teacher-training increased belief in neuromyths. On the other hand, specific in-service training pertaining to educational neuroscience improved scores. Conclusion: Neuromyths are prevalent among teachers and appear to inform their teaching practice. Further research needs to be conducted to explore not just the prevalence of these myths but in what ways they may be impacting teaching and learning outcomes in the classroom. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors, or incidental happiness more specifically, have the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or “carryover effect”). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 3611) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups, and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland (total N = 2220), also induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings, which emerged uniformly in three different countries, among different partisan and ideological groups, and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Recent studies, however, suggest that childhood vaccine misinformation is either more common among Republicans, or is uninfluenced by partisan identification (PID). Uncertainty about the partisan underpinnings of vaccine misinformation acceptance is important, as it could complicate efforts to pursue pro-vaccine health policies. I theorize that Republicans should be more likely to endorse anti-vaccine misinformation, as they tend to express more-negative views toward scientific experts. Across six demographically and nationally representative surveys, I find that—while few Americans think that “anti-vaxxers” are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats—Republican PID is significantly associated with the belief that childhood vaccines can cause autism. Consistent with theoretical expectations, effect is strongly mediated by anti-expert attitudes—an effect which supplemental panel analyses suggest is unlikely to be reverse causal. © The Author(s) 2021.",

Facing the worldwide pandemic, academic libraries in various countries are still exploring how to cope with the situation. Little research has been carried out on how academic libraries should systematically promote information literacy education during the pandemic. This study uses 42 academic libraries at the top universities in China as cases for content analysis, focusing on information literacy education via online mini-courses, lectures, and other online teaching methods. The study has found that information literacy education during the pandemic has several characteristics, such as rapid response to information needs, recommending reliable information resources to users, developing and gathering current information on COVID-19 cases, and resisting misinformation and false information. Although libraries act quickly to meet users' needs in this new situation, they are still confronted with some problems, such as insufficient planning, untimely updates, incomplete resources, etc. This study suggests that libraries adopt the following approaches to the development of information literacy education under the new norm of the pandemic: boosting online courses with multi-platform linkage; developing innovative teaching models with online and offline combination; exploring teaching opportunities and expanding teaching content according to new information needs; fighting misinformation. © 2021",
10.1007/s11229-019-02471-8,ignorance as a productive response to epistemic perturbations,"This paper argues that ignorance, rather than being a result or representation of false beliefs or misinformation, is a compensatory epistemic adaptation of complex rhetoric systems. A rhetoric system is here defined as a set of interconnected rhetorical elements (beliefs, arguments, commonplaces [loci communes], meanings, and texts) that cohere into a self-organized system that is thoroughly “about” its contexts—meaning that its own boundaries and relations are both constrained and enabled by the contexts in which it exists. Ignorance, as described here, is epistemic management that preserves the boundaries and relations of a rhetoric system, and is a way of dealing with information that runs counter to one’s beliefs. Ignorance is also productive, in that it produces new knowledge that works to make rhetoric systems more resistant to potential destabilization. To elaborate these points, the paper examines discourse about the phenomenon of global climate change, which illustrates how individuals productively counter information as a way of preserving beliefs. As the paper argues, ignorance is neither a cognitive nor epistemological failure, but rather is a result of the dynamic and continuous process of enforcing epistemic and rhetorical boundaries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",

Authors hypothesize that the explanation lies in the popularity-based logic governing Google’s foundational PageRank algorithm, in conjunction with the “law of retraction”: a retraction notice is typically taken to be less interesting and therefore less popular with internet users than the original content retracted. This chapter presents an empirical study drawing on records of articles retracted due to fraud (fabrication of data) in the Retraction Watch public database. It finds that both Google Search and Google Scholar more often than not rank a link to the original article higher than a link indicating that the article has been retracted.

10.1089/elj.2020.0652,combatting foreign election interference: canada's electoral ecosystem approach to disinformation and cyber threats,"Foreign election interference presents a significant threat to electoral fairness, democratic legitimacy, and public confidence in elections. This article argues for an ""electoral ecosystem""approach to combatting the threat of foreign intervention in elections. Under an electoral ecosystem approach, the electoral system is viewed as an interconnected network of institutions, processes, and actors, all of which must coordinate together to ensure electoral effectiveness and legitimacy. An electoral ecosystem is comprised of multiple institutions and actors, including governments, political parties, voters, third parties, online platforms, and electoral management bodies. Given the interdependence and interconnected nature of an electoral system, there are multiple points of vulnerability that must be defended. An electoral ecosystem approach does not depend on any one single line of defense but instead relies on a multiplicity of strategies that protect the institutions and individuals that comprise the ecosystem. To further explore the electoral ecosystem approach, this article focuses on Canada's response to foreign interference in elections. The ecosystem approach consists of three principal strategies. The first strategy involves a set of new campaign finance regulations which directly prevents the influence of foreign individuals and groups on the election. The second strategy consists of new measures to reduce disinformation and to lessen its distorting impact on democratic discourse. To the extent that foreign election interference takes place through social media, efforts to reduce disinformation will also reduce the impact of foreign interference. The third strategy involves strengthening Canadian cybersecurity. A number of steps have been taken recently, including the coordination of Canada's security agencies and the adoption of new measures to prevent computer hacking and privacy intrusions. These three strategies, and the multiple measures within each, provide protection across the electoral ecosystem. © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",

This is not the first attempt by the country’s leadership to bring all actors into a legal and civilized channel (the draft law On the Media No. 2693, which is also under consideration by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, stands for the systematic policy of reforming the media sector of Ukraine). The research is aimed at defining the place of the draft law in the reformed system of legal regulation of the Ukrainian media, from the position of the academic community neutral to the process. For this purpose, a detailed content analysis was conducted, which showed that, in the long run, the ambiguous wording of the adopted document at the stage of its enforcement, leaves the regulatory authorities free to interpret it depending on the interests of the parties, rather than on the language of the law. Considering the risks associated with the entry into force of this draft, one should also take into account the ambiguous reaction of the local and international media community.

They noticed that objective facts in these days influence public opinion less than emotion and subjective belief. Fake news is considered the main manifestation of post-truth. Perceptive people look at post-truth as pre-fascism. It prepares the ground for absolute power. When governments use their propaganda machinery for handing out sensational reports, unverified statistics-making unproven claims, unrealizable promises, and unjustifiable allegations-the entire society is held to ransom. Fake news can appear not only in the form of political deception but also of scientific facts or historic data to prop up the dominant clique’s ideology or interests. Today, society is getting tired of chaotic democracy, vociferous street demonstrations that lead to no conclusions, competitive corruption between parties that only strengthens each other, clash of sectarian political lobbies, indecisive leaders, etc. No wonder people long for a “Strong "". There are many countries in the world today where the educational system is manipulated by the ruling dispensation, information controlled, self-censorship demanded, political institutions weakened, and the dominant culture imposed. Indeed, individual citizens and alert groups ought to observe, study, and judge for themselves what news is from reliable sources and what is not, and how false information is passed round by interested parties, sectarian groups, social and religious radicals to further their own interests, and the ruling clique to strengthen their power. Democracy must not be allowed to give way to fascism with the use of fake news and falsehoods. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Jānis (John) Tālivaldis Ozoliņš.",
10.1093/oso/9780192893338.003.0002,epistemic bubbles and authoritarian politics,"Contemporary U.S. political discourse is distorted by “epistemic bubbles.” In social epistemology, an epistemic bubble is a self-segregated network for the circulation of ideas, resistant to correcting false beliefs. Dominant models of epistemic bubbles explain some of their features, but fail to account for their recent spread, increasing extremity, and asymmetrical distribution across political groups. The rise of populist authoritarian politics explains these recent changes. I propose two models of how populism creates epistemic bubbles or their functional equivalents: (1) by promulgating biased group norms of information processing; and (2) by replacing empirically-oriented policy discourse with an identity-expressive discourse of group status competition. Each model recommends different strategies for popping epistemic bubbles. My analysis suggests that social epistemology needs to get more social, by modeling cognitive biases as operating collectively and outside people’s heads, via group epistemic and discursive norms. © the several contributors 2021.",
10.1093/jicj/mqab022,digital integrity: exploring digital evidence vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies for open source researchers,"Researchers working with digital evidence must be aware of its vulnerabilities if they hope to maximize its value for justice and accountability. In this paper, we highlight two important vulnerabilities: the impermanent nature of digital evidence, and its susceptibility to attack from online dis/misinformation campaigns. We argue that to overcome the challenge that the impermanent nature of digital evidence presents, researchers can implement rapid response archiving techniques that, while not as rigorous as protocols set out for the collection of evidence in legal cases, could leave them with digital breadcrumbs to aid with the recovery of deleted digital evidence. We further propose that researchers consider implementing a stance of radical transparency in the collection, synthesis, and presentation of digital evidence with the goal of fortifying it against dis/misinformation campaigns.  © The Author(s) (2021).",

This in turn (3) highlighted the tensions between cities and their respective newspapers. Journalists writing for these papers—in particular, in Vicksburg and New Orleans—penned accusations that reporters in the other city either sensationalized or understated the impact of the epidemic, thereby undermining their own ability to protect their hometowns from threats to public health, economic stability, and regional or national reputations. At times, multiple papers from the same city argued about the accuracy of each other’s epidemic coverage. Although public health, science, medicine, and journalism have developed tremendously since 1878, this story reminds us of the significance of local news and cooperation between citizens and journalists when facing contemporary health crises, such as COVID-19. Without a robust foundation for covering epidemics on the local level, broader journalistic networks are far less equipped to fulfill their essential roles in mitigating outbreaks. © 2021 History Division of the AEJMC.",

Is it a bioweapon designed in a Chinese laboratory? These conspiracy theories typically have an intergroup flavour, blaming one group for having some involvement in either manufacturing the virus or controlling public opinion about it. In this article, I will discuss why people are attracted to conspiracy theories in general, and why conspiracy theories seem to have flourished during the pandemic. I will discuss what the consequences of these conspiracy theories are for individuals, groups, and societies. I will then discuss some potential strategies for addressing the negative consequences of conspiracy theories.

Accurate and reliable information plays an important role in the development of society; however, misinformation or unreliable information leads towards misguidance/destruction of society. Also, misinformation generates uncertainty among society members. So, each member of the society must identify the level of uncertainty to accept or reject the information. Although less uncertainty in information may lead information seekers towards decision making. This research paper explores uncertainty, elements of uncertainty, and levels of uncertainty during information seeking by reviewing the relevant literature.

We designed a visual forensic label of image authenticity, Picture-O-Meter, and tested the label’s efficacy in relation to its source and placement in an experiment with 2440 participants.

10.4324/9780429284571-22,digital media and the proliferation of public opinion cues online: biases and vulnerabilities in the new attention economy,"Perceptions of public opinion can influence attitudes and behaviour. Studies based on experiments show that when people encounter aggregate cues, such as opinion polls, and exemplar cues, such as ‘vox pop’ interviews, they gain a sense of public consensus about policy issues and political actors, even if the cues are not representative of public opinion. Social media have given rise to new public opinion cues, such as ‘likes’, shares, and comments, and these have even weaker links with real public opinion. However, these new cues activate powerful social endorsement affordances and, as a result, may influence perceptions of public opinion. We trace the effects of these new cues in the hybrid media system and explain how they constrain professional journalism’s role as mediator of the public’s attitudes. Social media cues can influence audiences’ perceptions of news and politics. Journalists’ use of social media cues in their reporting can also influence audience perceptions of politics and of journalism itself. The production and circulation of cues can be skewed by disinformation campaigns based on orchestrated botnets and commenting sock puppets. Due to their influence, fabricated public opinion cues on social media can render social media users, news audiences and journalists more vulnerable to manipulation and deception. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, James Morrison, Jen Birks and Mike Berry.",

10.3389/fcomm.2021.613794,"misconceptions, misinformation and politics of covid-19 on social media: a multi-level analysis in ghana","Background: Ghana developed an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) in response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. A key strategy in the EPRP is to mobilize national resources and put in place strategies for improved risk and behavioral change communication. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised on social media about COVID-19 misinformation and misconceptions. This study used social media content to determine the types, forms and the effects of the myths, misconceptions and misinformation in Ghana's COVID-19 containment. Method: The study was conducted in three phases involving the use of both primary and secondary data. Review of social media information on COVID-19 was done. This was complemented with document review and interviews with key stakeholders with expertise in the management of public health emergencies and mass communication experts (N = 18). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo 12. Results: The study showed a changing pattern in the misconceptions and misinformation about COVID-19. Initially myths were largely on causes and vulnerability. It was widely speculated that black people had some immunity against COVID-19. Also, the condition was perceived to cause severe disease among the elderly. These misconceptions served as risk attenuators among Ghanaians, especially the younger generation. As the infection evolved in the country, another misconception emerged that the hot climate in Africa inhibited viral replication and transmission only to be followed by speculations and conjectures that COVID-19 was being used as a biological weapon to target developed economics. For the management of COVID-19, the use of local remedies such as Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and herbal preparation also emerged. Myths about the efficacy of locally manufactured gin (akpeteshie) and hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis led to abuse of such substances. Interview segments revealed the use of myths to propagate political agenda in the country. Conclusion: The study concludes that COVID-19 misconceptions and misinformation are widespread and cover the course of the condition. These myths necessitate culturally sensitive health communication strategies that take into account local perceptions of COVID-19 in order to tackle the circulation of misconceived messages about the pandemic in Ghana. © Tabong and Segtub.",

From among thewrongful convictions that have been widely reported, it has been found that about 72% of these occurred due to eyewitness misidentification, among other reasons. This chapter unravels the various factors that affect the accuracy of eyewitness testimony and eyewitness identification. Different case studies from across the globe, including South Asia, are critically analysed to diagnose the fallibility in eyewitness testimony and determine the weightage that should be given to such evidence. Various cognitive psychological theories such as fuzzytrace theory, source monitoring, verbal overshadowing, and models of misinformation (overwriting, misinformation, activation-based model) will be used to highlight the memory fallacies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",

We identified a group of respondents who refused categorically to believe in the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia - COVID-19 dissidents. They not only deny the pandemic but also refuse to comply with pandemic rules and restrictions. Then, based on seven national samples covering a combined total of 40, 700 people in all regions of Russia, we established a link between the level of distrust of the public sector and the level of COVID-19 dissidence by means of linear regression. We proved that COVID-19 dissidents do not trust official statistics and believe in low infection risks. They provide low evaluation of the medical aid quality which leads to underestimation of the risk of being infected and COVID-19 compliance rules. We recommend governments consider restoring citizens' trust as one of the priorities in fighting the pandemic, alongside battling misinformation that feeds conspiracy beliefs. The level of public trust in government decisions is a critical factor that speeds up mass vaccinations and contributes to a quick exit from the pandemic crisis.  © HSE, 2021.",

In this chapter, we investigate the emerging online practices of science communicators in Canada. We focus on how science communicators are adapting and thriving online and what they value. Using social media research tools and survey data gathered from communicators, we found that social media communicators of science in Canada are focused in areas including conservation advocacy, women in STEM, science-art and combating misinformation. Social media communicators of science were more likely to be involved in informal community networks rather than professional associations. While there were similarities, we found significant differences in emerging practices in Quebec and other provinces in Canada, and in the main representations and motivations of communicators. Popular social media communicators in Quebec tended to be associated with traditional science media platforms. Social media communicators in our study continued to value engagement, relevance, writing quality, accessibility and accuracy. However, some were also motivated to promote inclusivity, to represent diversity and to overcome marginalization through their communication. It will be important for researchers and professional organizations to better understand the role of online networks and networking for professional development and support for emerging science communication practices. Communication practices motivated by a desire to promote equity and inclusivity in STEM are also increasingly important and require more attention from science communication researchers and practitioners. © China Science and Technology Press 2021.",

Spreading dezinformatsiya has a long history, but today it is done with a volume and accuracy that has left the targeted societies deeply destabilized as facts and events become sharply contested among citizens. This chapter is a descriptive work illustrating the essential components of this activity and draws three important conclusions. First, because disinformation aims to twist the truth in subtle ways when key facts remain secret and unavailable, exposing an operation becomes a tedious and difficult task. Second, the new digital world has opened the door to omnipresent operations that occur below the threshold of armed conflict and are accelerated exponentially by big data warehousing and algorithms that allow individualized targeting during an election cycle. Third, when disinformation operations disrupt the flow of information during a political campaign, the candidates involved and the process itself emerge with a dangerously eroded legitimacy. With a view to fill in critical missing data, the chapter ends with a clarion call to allow access for social scientists to study in detail of what is happening in the opaque public square of online social media wherever more political understanding is being fashioned. © Duncan B.

The credibility of news media outlets as our gatekeepers and first form of resistance to polluted information is increasingly questioned. Scientific research indicates that the quality of news offerings from news media outlets would benefit by triangulating news stories with a more diverse set of offerings and, in the process, build journalists’ trust or otherwise in the sources of these offerings. Without the network effects of the Internet, false or incorrect information probably would not be such a successful phenomenon. Public opinion is quick to portray social or mainstream media platforms as guilty parties but tends to ignore the equally detrimental ramifications of their exploitation of social capital. A more reflective approach is required.

Reliance on science as a basis for making sound policy decisions generally has prevailed, with a few exceptions.

Not infrequently, certain populations of men— poor men, African men, Mexican men, Wall Street men, rural men, urban men—are tagged as especially prone to violence, because they are purportedly less able and less intent on controlling their supposed primordial male urges to act out hostilities. Using examples including mass murders in the United States, World War I in Europe, the gender binary at the Vatican, and male suicidality around the world, we examine popular beliefs about men and violence in a range of cross-cultural contexts that are couched in terms of nature and animality (and sometimes hormones, Y chromosomes, and evolution) to analyze more closely the components of gender-based violence and to question the everyday language used to describe presumed inherent qualities of maleness shared by humans and other animals. © 2020 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Using an exploratory qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. This study provides insights into the culturally situated, complicated information behaviour of repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. The findings of this study show that repatriated migrants did not seek any information in the context of their irregular migration. It is evident that factors such as unrealistic perceptions and expectations about life abroad, desperate desire to relocate to another country, and trust in smugglers and their agents played a key role in their information seeking in the context of their irregular migration. The study revealed that some participants were unaware of the risk of taking an irregular journey and deceived by the misinformation shared by their smugglers and their agents. Some interviewees even claimed not to attempt to move to Malaysia if they were aware of the heavy risks associated with the move. The concepts of ""migration as gambling""and ""Aladdin's lamp""emerged in this study have some implications for local informational program development aiming to educate vulnerable rural population about the risk of irregular migration and connect them with reliable migrational information sources. The study identified some information grounds such as the Bazaar and Betel fields, which might be useful in offering informational programs at those grounds. The findings related to the information behaviour of repatriated migrants have potential implications for research in various disciplines, including library and information science, migrational studies, geography, and psychology. © 2021 Nafiz Zaman Shuva, published by De Gruyter.",

10.1108/IJCMA-02-2020-0027,a multi-national validity analysis of the argumentativeness measure,"Purpose: The argumentativeness measure has been used in more than a 100 studies since 1982. The measure was developed and validated within a US university/college student sample. Despite its intended use, the measure is regularly used outside of the US and outside of the university/college setting without tests of validity. There is also intense debate as to the dimensionality of the measure, with one camp defending the bi-dimensionality of the measure and another proposing uni-dimensionality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the utility of the measure outside of its intended population. Design/methodology/approach: A total of seven samples were collected (n = 1860) from the UK, Germany, France, Turkey, the Philippines, Nicaragua and the US. In this study, Infante and Rancer’s (1982) original 20-item argumentativeness measure was used to assess argumentativeness. Confirmatory factor analyses was used to test content validity. Findings: Fit statistics were consistently poor for the unidimensional factor structure. As there is debate as to whether the measure is uni or bi-dimensional, a bi-dimensional fit was also analysed. The measure performed slightly better in each sample using a bi-dimensional factor structure. However, fit statistics were still poor for each sample. Research limitations/implications: Specifically, the seven samples are convenience samples. While such a sampling technique does limit the generalizability of a study’s findings, convenience samples are common when using the argumentativeness measure. These results present avenues for exploring the dimensionality of the argumentativeness measure and for revisiting cross-cultural examinations of argumentativeness. Practical implications: Factor structure is a critical issue in validity. Whether authors specify their prediction or not, factor structure is always hypothesized as part of a study when measurements are used, and therefore, should be examined in every study as part of the scientific process. Making claims about human behaviour based upon measures with mis-specified factor structures or other validity issues can lead to the perpetuation of misinformation within the literature. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to empirically explore the psychometric properties of one of the most used measures in argument/conflict research. In doing so, this study enhances the understanding of decades of argumentativeness research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Yet few studies have investigated the confidence-accuracy relationship in witness interviews or exactly when confidence judgments should be taken. Across three experiments, 831 adults answered questions about a mock crime and rated their confidence in each response. Participants gave their confidence immediately after each response or at the end of the memory test. The timing of the confidence judgment did not affect the confidence-accuracy relationship, and the confidence-accuracy relationship remained strong even when participants encoded the event under poor visibility conditions. When participants were unknowingly exposed to misinformation, however, the confidence-accuracy relationship was substantially weakened—participants became highly over-confident in the accuracy of their memories. These findings help to refine the parameters in which witness confidence serves as a useful indicator of memory accuracy. © 2021 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition",

NA,"estonia, latvia, and lithuania: background and u.s.-baltic relations","Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, often referred to as the Baltic states, are close U.S. allies and considered among the most pro-U.S. countries in Europe. Strong U.S. relations with these three states are rooted in history. The United States never recognized the Soviet Union’s forcible incorporation of the Baltic states in 1940, and it applauded the restoration of their independence in 1991. These policies were backed by Congress on a bipartisan basis. The United States supported the Baltic states’ accession to NATO and the European Union (EU) in 2004. Especially since Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, potential threats posed to the Baltic states by Russia have been a primary driver of increased U.S. and congressional interest in the region. Congressional interest in the Baltic states has focused largely on defense cooperation and security assistance for the purposes of deterring potential Russian aggression and countering hybrid threats, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks. Energy security is another main area of U.S. and congressional interest in the Baltic region. Regional Security Concerns: U.S., NATO, and Baltic leaders have viewed Russian military activity in the region with concern; such activity includes large-scale exercises, incursions into Baltic states’ airspace, and a layered build-up of anti-access/area denial (A2AD) capabilities. Experts have concluded that defense of the Baltic states in a conventional military conflict with Russia likely would be difficult and problematic. The Baltic states fulfill NATO’s target of spending 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, although as countries with relatively small populations, their armed forces remain relatively small and their military capabilities limited. Consequently, the Baltic states’ defense planning relies heavily on their NATO membership. Defense Cooperation and Security Assistance: The United States and the Baltic states cooperate closely on defense and security issues. New bilateral defense agreements signed in spring 2019 focus security cooperation on improving capabilities in areas such as maritime domain awareness, intelligence sharing, surveillance, and cybersecurity. The United States provides significant security assistance to the Baltic states; the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (P.L. 116-92) increased and extended U.S. assistance for building interoperability and capacity to deter and resist aggression. Under the U.S. European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), launched in 2014, the United States has bolstered its military presence in Central and Eastern Europe. As part of the associated Operation Atlantic Resolve, rotational U.S. forces have conducted various training activities and exercises in the Baltic states. NATO has also helped to bolster the Baltic states’ security. At the 2016 NATO summit, the allies agreed to deploy multinational battalions to each of the Baltic states and Poland. The United Kingdom leads the battalion deployed in Estonia, Canada leads in Latvia, and Germany leads in Lithuania. Rotational deployments of aircraft from NATO member countries have patrolled the Baltic states’ airspace since 2004; deployments have increased in size since 2014. Potential Hybrid Threats: Since 2014, when the EU adopted sanctions targeting Russia due to the Ukraine conflict, tensions between Russia and the Baltic states have grown. These conditions have generated heightened concerns about possible hybrid threats and Russian tactics, such as disinformation campaigns and propaganda, to pressure the Baltic states and promote anti-U.S. or anti-NATO narratives. A large minority of the Estonian and Latvian populations consists of ethnic Russians; Russia frequently accuses Baltic state governments of violating the rights of Russian speakers. Many ethnic Russians in the Baltic states receive their news and information from Russian media sources, potentially making those communities a leading target for disinformation and propaganda. Some observers have expressed concerns that Russia could use the Baltic states’ ethnic Russian minorities as a pretext to manufacture a crisis. Cyberattacks are another potential hybrid threat; addressing potential vulnerabilities with regard to cybersecurity is a top priority of the Baltic states. Energy Security: The Baltic states have taken steps to decrease energy reliance on Russia, including through a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Lithuania and projects to build pipeline and electricity interconnections with Poland, Finland, and Sweden. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",

Dismisinformation is amplified by social reinforcement forces in echo chambers, information bubbles, and homophilous networks further facilitated by the nature of social media. A number of hashtags related to dismisinformation have strong collocation and synchronization properties. The “COVID is a hoax/overblown” theme is coupled with the classic anti-vaccination theme of forced vaccinations and resulting autism.

10.4324/9781351187237-12,conservatives and news feeds,"News exposure on Facebook does not occur at random: it comes from users’ friends who share links, from paid promotions by media companies, and from posts by pages liked by users. This analysis considers the specific curated flows that result from liking public Facebook pages for national news sources and whether partisanship selective exposure drives individuals’ choices of which outlets to follow. Results show that individuals like Facebook pages for national news sources in a manner consistent with their preexisting political beliefs. Furthermore, partisanship predicts the overall bias in Facebook pages liked by subjects. Several additional patterns emerge that are unique to Republicans: Republicans like a much higher share of like-minded sources than Democrats, and as they like more Facebook pages for national news, their political bias in national news pages liked increases. This asymmetric filter bubble may help explain the spread of viral disinformation during the 2016 election and has deleterious consequences for deliberative democracy. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",
10.18060/24035,"dyslexia primer for social work: translational research to update strengths-based practice, advocacy, and attitudes","Dyslexia is a lifelong epigenetic neurobiological difference (neurodiversity) in brain formation and processing. Though highly prevalent, most people, including social workers, know little about dyslexia. Whereas dyslexia predicts common cognitive strengths and weaknesses, it is most often associated only with weaknesses, due to misinformation or a simple lack of information. As a result, pervasive myths (e.g., laziness, low IQ) drive beliefs, attitudes, and policies that contribute to disproportionally poorer educational, financial, justice system, and mental health outcomes for individuals with dyslexia - a cycle of externally and internally applied stigmas with significant practical effects. This analysis applies a person-in-environment conceptual framework to explain this cycle, as a step toward disrupting it. The analysis uses translational research methods, drawing from current science, to provide positive framing to dispel common stigmatizing myths and to foster strengths-based social work practice and advocacy by and for individuals with dyslexia. © 2021 Author.",
10.4324/9781003203551-12,fake news as a challenge for media credibility,"In this fast transforming digital world, the media industry is facing increasing economic, social and technological challenges, as well as changing media consumption habits. Social media consumers, also called the digital natives, tend to spend most of their time on social media and multimedia platforms. They are inclined to substitute traditional media with social media and other online services. This study argues that despite these significant transformations and the growing standing of online media, online users still perceive traditional media to be more credible sources of information than user-generated content on social media. Social media enables a breadth of ‘fake news’, which brings the overall perception of media into a different perspective. The phenomenon of misinformation and mistrust could be a new indicator of a crisis in the media that led to the post-truth era. Due to the profound negative impact of fake news on individuals and society, various detection solutions have been proposed. The users recognize the importance of regulation, particularly concerning public responsibility and the transparency of social media, as well as privacy issues. This chapter illustrates the challenges for society and modern democracy that arise from changing media consumption habits regarding credibility and trust issues. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Noureddine Miladi; individual chapters, the contributors.",

We point out that this story pulsates with the constituent elements of contemporaneity: certainties crumbling away, doubt rendered absolute, absence of reliable references that might structure us, the game of appearances to which reality has been reduced, the individual’s glacial loneliness. What is surprising is that Kafka anticipates by one century, and in an astonishing way, what has now become socially and politically de rigueur in 2020 Brazil: the age of post-truth, of fake news, of the staggering demoralization of politics, of lying as a strategy. We thus hope to show that if Walter Benjamin’s reflections help us to read Kafka’s tale, both Kafka and Benjamin help us to “read” our own time © 2021,Estudos Avancados.All Rights Reserved",
10.1126/sciadv.abe4164,misinformation tactics protect rare birds from problem predators,"Efficient decision-making integrates previous experience with new information. Tactical use of misinformation can alter choice in humans. Whether misinformation affects decision-making in other free-living species, including problem species, is unknown. Here, we show that sensory misinformation tactics can reduce the impacts of predators on vulnerable bird populations as effectively as lethal control. We repeatedly exposed invasive mammalian predators to unprofitable bird odors for 5 weeks before native shorebirds arrived for nesting and for 8 weeks thereafter. Chick production increased 1.7-fold at odor-treated sites over 25 to 35 days, with doubled or tripled odds of successful hatching, resulting in a 127% increase in modeled population size in 25 years. We demonstrate that decision-making processes that respond to changes in information reliability are vulnerable to tactical manipulation by misinformation. Altering perceptions of prey availability offers an innovative, nonlethal approach to managing problem predators and improving conservation outcomes for threatened species.

10.1007/978-3-030-42121-2_10,the epistemic justification for tolerance,"Epistemic arguments for tolerance aim to show that intolerance has various bad epistemic consequences, whereas tolerance enables various positive epistemic consequences. The epistemic consequences at stake here are epistemic values - things or states that are valuable from an epistemic perspective, a perspective having to do with knowledge, truth, understanding, and the like. John Stuart Mill’s defense of free speech in On Liberty is a paradigm example of an epistemic argument and his argument is still widely accepted and defended today. He argues that intolerance prevents us from discovering our errors, decreases understanding, and discourages intellectual curiosity, courage, and boldness. More recently, Jonathan Rauch defends an epistemic argument according to which tolerance is a necessary ingredient of liberal science, which is our most successful method for finding truth. However, detractors have argued that often tolerance itself either does not produce epistemic value or has negative epistemic consequences. People sometimes irrationally inflate the evidence, producers and consumers of informa tion often have other than epistemic goals that can encourage the spread of false beliefs, and the structure of networks of testifiers can be exploited to spread false beliefs. Some measure of intolerance - such as what Goldman calls content-related restrictions - might have positive epistemic consequences for society. The extent and effectiveness of such restrictions, as well as how they would relate to the full range of epistemic values both individual and collective, remains an underexplored topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",
10.3102/0034654321991228,quotation accuracy matters: an examination of how an influential meta-analysis on active learning has been cited,"When previous research is cited incorrectly, misinformation can infiltrate scientific discourse and undermine scholarly knowledge. One of the more damaging citation issues involves incorrectly citing article content (called quotation errors); therefore, investigating quotation accuracy is an important research endeavor. One field where quotation accuracy is needed is in the learning sciences given its impact on pedagogy. An integral article in pedagogical discussions surrounding how to teach at the college level is the meta-analysis on active learning by Freeman et al. The Freeman et al. meta-analysis compared active learning to traditional lecture in terms of its effects on student learning and has been important in national initiatives on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) reform. Given its influence coupled with the impact quotation errors could have in scientific discourse, we used citation context analysis to analyze whether assertions in the citing text that related to the efficacy of lecture and active learning were supported by what was explicitly stated in the cited meta-analysis. Assertions were analyzed undersupported, unsupported, or irrelevant for purposes of study categories. The most prevalent supported category related to active learning being more effective than lecture; the most prevalent unsupported category related to the effectiveness of specific activities/approaches other than the general approach of active learning. Overall, the percentage of supported assertions was 47.67%, and the percentage of unsupported assertions was 26.01%. Furthermore, the percentage of articles containing at least one unsupported assertion was 34.77%. Proactive measures are needed to reduce the incidence of quotation errors to ensure robust scientific integrity. © 2021 AERA.",
10.4324/9781003120254-3,world health organisation: the challenges of providing global leadership,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has the remit of offering global leadership and guidance on health emergencies and pandemics and so should play a crucial role in the management of strategy and communication concerning new viruses such as COVID-19. While the WHO was very active in supporting research and development, creating apps and databases and launching initiatives in the three most crucial areas, we find significant deficiencies. Partially due to the lack of transparency of the Chinese Government, early announcements were delayed and proven wrong undermining its credibility at the very start. Nation-states were forced to manage the pandemic based on their own experiences and conditions. The lack of clear information was compounded by the WHO being behind nations and airline companies on putting in place travel restrictions and there has been consistently contradictory advice on the efficacy of wearing face coverings. While the WHO were not at the forefront of the infodemic, the institution did little to combat misinformation and indeed provided some spaces where false notions could flourish nurtured by some WHO statements. The chapter analyses the role of the WHO and in doing so raises questions regarding the ability to have any form of global governance. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Darren Lilleker, Ioana A.

But in the last decade, the new age social media revolution has seen a renaissance of right wing nationalism, backed by an aggressive trend where ancient myths are transformed into historical facts and instant messaging groups are flooded with forwards of superstitious and irrational beliefs of religious exceptionalism. This has set the platform for a mythologization of science in a polarizing society eager to find sustenance in past glories. In such a fluid situation, it would be pertinent to ask how young Indians are handling the misinformation masquerading as science. This mixed method study explores the impact of the mythologization of science on Indian millennial group and the results show that they are not to be underestimated. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.",
10.30658/jicrcr.4.3.4,misinformation and government crisis management in south korea: understanding active publics’ belief in misinformation about the yemeni refugee issue and its effect on active communication behaviors,"This study aims to investigate how situationally motivated publics respond to misinformation in the context of the Yemeni refugee issue in South Korea. In particular, this study examined how situational motivation in problem-solving on the issue is associated with belief in misinformation and active communication behaviors in the framework of situation theory of problem-solving (STOPS). The results of this study showed that individuals with a high level of situational motivation are more likely to believe misinformation on a given issue. In addition, the result found that belief in misinformation mediates between situational motivation in problem-solving and information forwarding. The results of this study contribute to government crisis management dealing with refugee issues. Copyright 2021 Authors. Published under a Creative Commons Attribution.",
10.4324/9781003043379-27,health misinformation,"Research on health misinformation has grown rapidly as concerns about the potential harmful effects of health misinformation on individuals and society intensify amid a “post-truth” era. In this chapter, we provide a broad overview of current research and evidence concerning the many facets of health misinformation, including its sources, prevalence, characteristics (both content and diffusion features), impact, and mitigation. We conclude that health misinformation originates from many sources, most notably mass and social media; is fairly prevalent, both in interpersonal and mediated settings; and tends to feature negative sentiments, anecdotal evidence, and anti-science narratives. Although there is no conclusive evidence that health misinformation spreads more broadly than scientific information, health misinformation reliably leads to misperceptions on health issues. Efforts to mitigate the impact of health misinformation show early promise in correcting misperceptions. We offer several directions for future research. © 2022 Taylor and Francis",
NA,engaging journalism: news in the time of the covid-19 pandemic,"As COVID-19 continues to devastate the world, journalism is adapting itself as the public seeks trustworthy news and reliable information about the pandemic. Focused primarily on the U.S. but with key international points of comparison for context, this article looks at how news media in 2020 adapted to the challenges caused by the pandemic to the journalism industry — already disrupted by a host of forces, including digital technologies, changing economics, and a sharply divided cultural and political environment — and how the public has responded. Employing a meta-analysis of published research, data examined here indicate that the public has engaged the news at high levels, while news media have utilised new storytelling tools and technologies to create more accurate, interactive, immersive and mobile news content. Problems of misinformation, fuelled by social media, and other concerns persist, including a growing digital divide that may undermine the role of journalism as a source of independent, truthful and accessible news in a democratic society. © 2021, Taylor's University Lakeside Campus.

10.17951/sil.2021.30.5.53-74,the subjective dimension of fake news; [podmiotowy wymiar fake newsów],"The universal access to the Internet contributed to the dissemination and popularization of fake news. Their function is quite broad – they can influence the results of political elections, social attitudes and behavior or stock market quotations, and weaken social trust in particular categories of our existence. In the age of the Internet, thousands of new content with manipulated data is circulated every day, without any reliable research that destabilizes the perception of reality. Disinformation is not a new phenomenon, but it has never been such a powerful weapon. The omnipresence of fake news raises questions about the subject side, i.e. senders, content distributors, sources of responsibility for the published material. The aim of this article is an attempt to systematize the concept of fake news and indicate the entities responsible for broadcasting this type of content in the context of applicable law. For this reason, the following hypothesis was adopted: The indifference of approaches in defining the concept of fake news means that the authors and entities distributing content are not aware of the contradiction of the actions taken with generally applicable law. As a consequence, elements of the concept of fake news were distinguished and the entities disseminating this type of content were characterized. The article organizes the state of knowledge regarding fake news and fills the research gap. © 2021, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sklodowskiej w Lublinie. All rights reserved.",
10.1108/S0065-283020210000050004 91,container collapse and misinformation: why digitization creates challenges for democracy,"This chapter examines the impact of information digitization on the rise of misinformation, and the broader implications that this has for democracy. It is based on the Researching Students Information Choices (RSIC) project, which looks at how students evaluate scientific information on the internet.1 Part of this study looked at container collapse. In previous decades, information was contained in a physical book, newspaper, journal, magazine, or the like. These containers offered important contextual information about the origin and validity of the information. With information digitized, this context is lost. This can facilitate misinformation, as people might make incorrect judgments about information credibility because of the lack of context. It is vital that citizens have the information literacy skills to initially evaluate information correctly. One possibility for misinformation being pervasive is that, once encoded, it becomes resistant to correction. This underscores the importance of teaching students to evaluate the credibility of information prior to the point of encoding. To combat misinformation, librarians can teach students to evaluate containers and the indicators of credibility that they provide. Information containers can be evaluated prior to consuming information within a resource, while fact-checking only can happen after. Because of this, container evaluation can help prevent misinformation from being encoded. Our research demonstrates that this requires thoughtful engagement with the information resources and critical evaluation of the sources that produced them, and that students cannot accurately identify containers when they rely on heuristics like the URL and Google snippet. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",
NA,the dr congo’s petroleum industry: confusion and misperception over the real physical density of crude oil produced in the kongo central province of drc,"This paper examines the origin of confusion and misperception clouding the real physical density of crude oil produced in the Kongo Central province of the DRC, known as DR Congo. For many decades, there has been doubt, ambiguity, uncertainty and no accuracy or transparency concerning the real physical/chemical characteristics of crude oil produced in the DRC. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the characteristics of crude oils produced in other world regions to understand and classify the value of the DRC’s produced crude oil, by means of reference to the international standard that define the Gravity (°API) and Sulphur (Wt. %) of crude oil, whether it is light or heavy crude oil. It attempts to bring more evidence of crude oils characteristics that relate to crude oil produced in the DRC since 1973. The objective consists of categorising crude oil produced in the Kongo Central province of the DRC, to determine whether it has been Light Sweet, Light Sour, Medium-Medium Sour, Medium Sour, Heavy Sweet or Heavy Sour. This clarification is very critical in imperative to dissipate the cloud of misinformation and misperception of the property range of crude oil that has been produced consecutively by several multinational oil companies in the DRC since many decades. The PESTIE model or framework was applied to understand the mysterious and ambiguous barriers affecting the entire petroleum industry development in the DRC. A mixed methods approach was useful to gather different views, opinions and perceptions from qualified stakeholders involved in the DRC’s petroleum industry. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were proficient in revealing often multifaceted of the real value of the DRC’s crude oil. The results of this study revealed that the situation of misperception and confusion overshadowing crude oil specifications in the DRC are caused by a complex situation of the business environment uncertainties and instabilities, as well as the vulnerability of the political and socio-economic environments instituted by the colonial economic model (heritage and culture of exploitation and production of natural mineral resources) imposed by a complex system of the global business environment. Results also claimed that much confusion or uncertainties are from opinions, which are lacking accurate information regarding the correct statistical properties of crude oil produced in the country, as well as from the political interferences, frauds, and corruptions, which have been fuelling or influencing opinions about the mass or natural property range of the DRC’s produced crude oil. One of the approaches suggested in solving various challenges affecting the DRC’s petroleum industry consist of applying the best-practice of the rule of law; the review, monitoring and re-evaluation of policies, regulations, programmes, and strategic plans; transparency system and ensuring the business environment stability in the country. Managing accurately oil and gas activities in the country could be the outcome of less political interference in several socio-economic activities.

Understanding whether emotions are associated with distinguishing truth from fiction and sharing information has implications for interventions designed to curb the spread of misinformation. Among 1,341 Facebook users in Nigeria, we find that emotions—specifically happiness and surprise—are associated with greater belief in and sharing of false, relative to true, COVID-19 headlines.

Some individuals have done so successfully while others have outrightly resisted. This chapter reviews three primary constructs for which a burgeoning literature base has emerged, and which appear to be associated with compliance with health-protective behaviors in the context of COVID-19. First, the tendency to believe and propagate COVID-19 misinformation, primarily over social media. Two principal factors have been implicated in explaining some individuals’ tendency to share misinformation-evidence relating to deficient self-regulation and information overload is reviewed with the net result being decreased compliance. Second, perceived risk, the extent to which individuals view themselves to be vulnerable to infection coupled with beliefs relating to their perceived self-efficacy to successfully implement the recommended behaviors appears particularly important. Third, personality traits also appear to exert a degree of predictive control over compliance, albeit smaller in comparison to the preceding factors. Most notably individuals who are agreeable tend to comply while those with Dark Triad traits (Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism) are more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors (e.g., stockpiling). These results can be used to inform the design and dissemination of public health information during the pandemic; specifically, campaigns should include information that is clear, consistent, and understandable and emphasizes the effectiveness of the recommended behaviors so as to reduce uncertainty and increase public self-efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

10.1093/ijpor/edaa007,some deficits and some misperceptions: linking partisanship with climate change cognitions,"Partisans appear to hold very different information about climate change, with Republicans more likely to respond to knowledge questions incorrectly than Democrats or Independents. As polarization undermines the ability of science to inform policy, clarifying why partisans report different science knowledge is vital. This study uses novel measurement to differentiate among knowledge, misinformation, guessing, and rejection while identifying covariates of these cognitions. First, we find that Republicans' incorrect beliefs about climate change stem from a mix of guessing, misperceptions, and rejection. Second, multiple cognitions appear closely linked to partisanship, suggesting politically motivated reasoning as likely driving knowledge differences. Finally, partisan knowledge differences about climate change do not reflect broader polarization of science knowledge but are limited to select issues. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The overthrow of the government complicated Kosovo’s initial response to the crisis and from March 25, the country has been governed by a caretaker government prior to a new governing coalition being formed at the beginning of June. Measures were introduced on March 11 and later containment measures, events and travel restrictions were imposed. The numbers of new COVID-19 cases declined through the month of May when the reopening of the economy also took place. After restrictions were suspended, from the beginning of June, the number of new cases increased but despite this no new restrictions were put in place.

Giving access to reliable sources of information and resources with minimal barriers comprises cooperation among Librarians and Libraries. This article surveyed the roles of Librarians and Libraries in response to the problems of fake news and misinformation arising from the outbreak of COVID-19 focusing on how librarians and other information professionals in Nigeria have articulated the difficulties and the approaches put in place for combating misinformation. A descriptive research design was adopted for the study, and twenty-four (24) Federal Universities were randomly selected across the six (6) geopolitical zones of the country. Data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics, and presented in tables and graphs.

Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Realism is addressed as a representational choice as well as a political goal and is defined as the believable articulation of reality. By placing issues of credibility and the viewer’s role as arbiter of the work’s truth value in relation to contemporary notions of ‘truthiness’ (that are based on the viewer’s belief system rather than on fact) the article analyzes animated documentaries in the wider atmosphere of post-truth. I focus on two conflicting theorizations of realism: realism as the familiar and easily read vs. realism as de-familiarization. Whereas only a decade ago animated documentaries were deemed oxymoronic by many, as the sub-genre of animated documentaries proliferates it risks losing its critical potential and becoming an easy way to promote misinformation for viewers who cease to question the representation that becomes ‘invisible’ due to common use. That said, animated documentaries that creatively combine varied visual styles and intentionally disrupt viewing have the potential to de-familiarize by accentuating the representational choices made, which is crucial for engaging, critically evaluating information and creating counter narratives in a post-truth era. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0240664,quality of top webpages providing abortion pill information for google searches in the usa: an evidence-based webpage quality assessment,"Background In the United States, the internet is widely used to seek health information. Despite an estimated 18 million Google searches on abortion per year and the demonstrated importance of the abortion pill as an option for pregnancy termination, the top webpage search results for abortion pill searches, as well as the content and quality of those webpages, are not well understood. Methods We used Google’s Custom Search Application Programming Interface (API) to identify the top 10 webpages presented for “abortion pill” searches on August 06, 2018. We developed a comprehensive, evidence-based Family Planning Webpage Quality Assessment Tool (FPWQAT), which was used to assess webpage quality for the five top webpages presenting text-based educational content. Results Of the top webpages for “abortion pill” searches, a plannedparenthood.com page was the top result and scored highest on our assessment (81%), providing high-quality and useable information. The other four webpages, a Wikipedia.com page and three anti-abortion information webpages, scored much lower on our assessment (14%-43%). These four webpages had lower quality of information in less useable formats. The anti-abortion pages also presented a variety of disinformation about the abortion pill. Conclusions Both the lack of accurate clinical content on the majority of top webpages and the concerning disinformation they contained raise concerns about the quality of online abortion pill information, while underlining challenges posed by Google search results to informed choice for consumers. Healthcare providers and consumers must be informed of online abortion pill content that is not based in current clinical evidence, while advocates and policymakers should push for online information that is credible and useable. These changes are imperative given the importance of sound abortion pill information for reproductive decision-making at a time when in-person abortion services are further challenged in the US.

10.4324/9781003106715-16,when children are the worst and best eyewitnesses: factors behind the development of false memory,"This chapter discusses several false memory methods and theories that have frequently been employed to study and explain false memories and their development. It focuses on the developmental aspects of the formation of different types of false memories. Many studies that use suggestion to instigate false memories follow a procedure called the misinformation paradigm in which participants are exposed to erroneous information. False memory implantation studies have also been undertaken using child participants. In Associative Activation Theory is assumed that false memories are caused by associative activation spreading throughout an individual’s knowledge base. False memory models have emphasized that, in order to fuel false memory formation of fictitious events, people should first believe that the event is something plausible that could have happened to them. Experimentation in adults has found that, although script knowledge affects the formation of false beliefs, it is not a prerequisite for false beliefs to occur. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Jan Rummel.",

This has occurred because the main advantage of such media lies in the speed of creating and disseminating information. The price paid for this speed is fast editorial work (if any) and quick checking of facts and source credibility. In this chapter, an overview of computer-supported approaches for detecting disinformation and manipulative techniques based on several criteria is presented.

10.4018/978-1-7998-4769-4.ch017,is misinformation a challenge for science students in the digital era?,"This chapter will focus on the perception of scientific topics throughout digital dissemination and educational activities. By assessing the evolution on the impact of massive online information dissemination in scientific topics, the chapter aims to address the issue of quality and reliability of scientific information, disseminated towards university students. For this assessment, it will be argued if we must be concerned about a new generation of students being (intentionally or not) misinformed about core insights of their development. This will be done by outlining the major influences of digital and social media in science students ' scholastic activities. By adapting scientific models on the spread of misinformation, this chapter argues how students can be subject to gather and to be exposed to unfiltered data, which can potentially be demeaning to their educational development. © 2021 by IGI Global.

10.1386/jams_00046_1,covid-19 containment and control: information source credibility and adoption of prevention strategies among residents in south west nigeria,"The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has generated unprecedented information on preventive strategies aimed at containment and control of the disease. This study examined the relationship between perceived credibility of information sources and adoption of COVID-19 preventive strategies among residents in South West Nigeria. The study adopted Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), while online survey and in-depth interview (IDI) were employed as the research designs. Convenience and purposive sampling procedures were used in the selection of 259 respondents and ten participants who were 18 years and above. Data were generated using questionnaire and interview guide. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and multiple bootstrapping comparison test were used to analyse quantitative data, while qualitative data were transcribed and direct quotations that represented the participants’ opinions were used for the analysis. Key findings showed that expertise and trustworthiness determined the credibility of information sources while television was perceived as the most credible source of information. A significant relationship exists between perceived credibility of information sources and adoption of preventive measures. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies to be disseminated through credible information sources. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.",
10.18505/cuid.851782,some findings regarding the chain of narrators (sanad) and textual content (matn) evaluation of the reports about the barking of hawaab dogs; [hav'eb köpeklerinin havlaması olayıyla ilgili rivâyetlerin sened ve muhteva değerlendirmesine dâir bazı tespitler],"'Alī b. Abī Tālib (d. 40/661), who took over the caliphate duty in a troubled environment after the murder of 'Uthmān b. 'Affān (d. 35/656), first faced with the demands that the murderers of his murdered predecessor be punished. Although Hazrat 'Ali himself was of the same opinion, he wanted to ensure public order in the city first. However, the Companions of the Prophet (aṣ-ṣaḥābah) like Zubayr b. al-'Awwām (d. 36/656) and Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh (d. 36/656), who were not convinced about this issue, started an opposition movement under the leadership of 'Ā'isha bt. Abī Bakr (d. 58/678), who went to Mecca. The attempts of this movement, which got out of control with the participation of Umayyads and 'Abdallāh b. Saba' supporters of different intentions, ended with The Battle of the Camel. Before the war took place, Hazrat 'Ā'isha heard the barking of dogs when the army led by 'Ā'isha came to Hawaab on the road to Basra. For this reason, she asked where they were. When she heard that this region was Hawaab, she wanted to go back. Because the Hazrat Prophet had said the following before: ""Which of you the Haw's dogs will bark for."" The following statement is used in the hadīth sources in several different variants, generally without specifying a name: ""Thereupon, the people with her wanted her to continue her journey, hoping that the Muslims would recover.” At this point, there is a difference between hadīth sources and Islamic historical sources. Islamic historical sources state that the people who wanted her to continue her journey were Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh, Zubayr b. al-'Awwām and 'Abdallāh b. al-Zubayr (d. 73/692). The following statements are included in another narration reported from Ibn 'Abbās (d. 68/688) regarding the issue: The Prophet said to his wives: “I wish I knew! Which of you owns the beautiful hairy camel!” She will set out and then Hawaab dogs will bark at her, many people will be killed, right and left. Then she will survive when she is almost dead. A fifth piece of news mentioned within this framework was narrated by Abū Rāfi' (d. 40/660). According to this rumor, the Prophet of Allah said to Hazrat 'Ali: ""Something will happen between you and 'Ā'isha."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""O Prophet of God! Me?"" Allah's Prophet said: ""Yes."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""Is it me among my friends?"" Allah's Prophet said: ""Yes."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""Well, did I trouble them?"" The Prophet of Allah said: ""No,"" and then added: ""If such a thing happens, take her to a safe place."" The sixth narration on the subject is a statement made by Hudhayfa b. al-Yamân (d. 36/656). Accordingly, Hudhayfa said: ""Would you believe me if I told you that one of your mothers will set out with a group of Muslims and will fight you?"" Those who were there said: ""Will this really happen?"" Hudhayfa said: ""Yes"". The last narration mentioned in this context is the news of Abu Bakra (d. 52/671). According to this narration: ""Abū Bakra said: Immediately after joining the people of Camel in order to fight with them in the days of Camel, Allah helped me with a word I heard from the Prophet. When the news that the Persians appointed the daughter of Kisra as the ruler reached the Prophet, the Prophet said: ‘The people who entrust their works to women will not find peace'. "" In such a situation, it becomes important to analyze the narrations. Because analyzing the reliability of the narrators and the contents of the narrations will help to understand the subject in a healthy way. Although hadith scholars make some different statements about the reliability of the people who narrated the narrations, the view that gains weight is that they are reliable. Likewise, no problem was detected in the contents of the narrations. Some problems draw attention when Islamic historical sources are considered. For, these historians were not as sensitive as hadith scholars regarding the evaluation of the narrations. At this point, two problems draw attention: The transponder understanding adopted in the early stages of historiography. The effort to protect some valued people. Early historians generally adopted the transponder understanding while writing their works. For this reason, some misinformation that was not analyzed began to be passed down from generation to generation. At this point, the science of history should benefit from the methods of hadith and its sound narrations. In addition, the effort to protect a valuable person like Hazrat 'A'isha has brought the understanding of holding the Companions like Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh and Zubayr b. al-'Awwām responsible for a behavior that is thought to be wrong. However, it should not be ignored that people can make mistakes. Loving Hazrat 'Ā'isha does not require defending her wrong decision. In addition, this has brought the accusation of other Companions of behavior unbecoming to them. © 2021 Published by Sivas Cumhuriyet Üniversitesi, İlahiyat Fakültesi / Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Faculty of Theology, Sivas, 58140 Turkey.

There is a recurrent need to deal with this type of problem, especially aggravated by the presidential race of 2018, where there is an increase in the reproduction of news whose reliability of the source is not verified, although they are evidently false, exaggerated, and sensationalist.

10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113216,shouting at each other into the void: a linguistic network analysis of vaccine hesitance and support in online discourse regarding california law sb277,"In 2015, California passed Senate Bill 277 and became the third state in the United States to ban all nonmedical exemptions from school immunization requirements, effectively prohibiting religious and personal belief exemptions. This attracted grassroots opposition and considerable debate among vaccine hesitant factions online. This mixed-methods study used quantitative linguistic analysis, semantic network analysis, and content analysis techniques to examine 2424 online documents drawn from newspapers, blogs, health websites, government information pages, web forums, personal websites, Facebook groups, among others. The study examined which words and phrases were used most frequently by vaccine skeptics, vaccine defenders, and more neutral media accounts to illuminate how groups with different attitudes towards vaccination discuss and disseminate information about vaccines and vaccine policy online. We proposed an innovative methodology for examining online discourse surrounding vaccine hesitance, as well as for studying the online dissemination of misinformation about vaccines. Our findings highlighted discrepancies in the narratives between what vaccine supporters believe causes vaccine skepticism and the issues that vaccine skeptics actually discuss within their own digital spaces. For example, in these exchanges, the importance of parental rights overshadowed that of children's rights; supporters of vaccines brought up autism in more distinct documents than skeptics do; distrust of government regulators and researchers seemed to unite vaccine skeptics and defenders; and politicians, doctors, and even celebrities often served as proxies in heated exchanges about factual evidence, believability, and the importance of expertise in public discourse. © 2020 The Authors",
10.1371/journal.pone.0244440,communicating risk in human-wildlife interactions: how stories and images move minds,"Effectively communicating risk is critical to reducing conflict in human-wildlife interactions. Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk. © 2020 Guenther, Shanahan.

10.1038/s41598-020-62085-w,"a minimalistic model of bias, polarization and misinformation in social networks","Online social networks provide users with unprecedented opportunities to engage with diverse opinions. At the same time, they enable confirmation bias on large scales by empowering individuals to self-select narratives they want to be exposed to. A precise understanding of such tradeoffs is still largely missing. We introduce a social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on new information, while a minority of participants reject information that is incongruent with their preexisting beliefs. This simple mechanism generates permanent opinion polarization and cascade dynamics, and accounts for the aforementioned tradeoff between confirmation bias and social connectivity through analytic results. We investigate the model’s predictions empirically using US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming. We conclude by discussing policy implications of our model, highlighting the downsides of debunking and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation. © 2020, The Author(s).",

Risk perceptions are known to be important determinants of an individual’s willingness to adopt health-protective behaviors during pandemics similar to COVID-19, including frequent hand washing, physical distancing, avoiding public places, and wearing face masks. The chapter discusses a number of health communication theoretical frameworks that may help to shed light on social media use and risk perceptions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media has been criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic as a medium for the rapid spread of fake news. Assessing the relationship between social media use and health behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention can be challenging for a variety of reasons. The chapter concludes with a discussion of potential future directions for research in the context of COVID-19 and risk perceptions. © 2021 John Wiley and Sons Inc.",
10.3390/journalmedia1010008,media and misinformation in times of covid-19: how people informed themselves in the days following the portuguese declaration of the state of emergency,"This study takes as a starting point the importance and dependence of the media to obtain information about the pandemic. The dependency theory of the media system was developed in the 1970s when mass media were the dominant source of information. Today, at a time when media choices have become abundant, studies are needed to understand the phenomenon of media dependence in light of new dimensions made important by the transformations that have taken place in the social and media fields—where the coexistence of mass media with social media platforms stands out. As large-scale crises rarely occur and the media environment changes rapidly, it is important to analyze how media dependence relates to choose and trust in different media (traditional media vs. social media) in times of crisis. Several questions arise. What is the trust attributed by individuals to social media as sources of information about COVID-19? How well informed are the individuals who choose these sources as the main sources of information? From a questionnaire administered to 244 individuals in Portugal, during the first week of the state of emergency (March 2020), this research seeks to identify how people gained access to information about COVID-19, how they acted critically towards the various sources and how they assess the reliability of different media. Finally, it analyzes the association between the type of medium chosen and adherence to misinformation content about the virus. The results reveal the existence of a phenomenon of dependence on the media, with a strong exposure (both active and accidental) to informative content, with conventional media being privileged as the main source, and positively distinguished in terms of confidence. Finally, a statistically significant association of a positive sign was identified between the use of social media as the main source and the acceptance of misinformation. © 2020 by the authors.",
10.1037/pspa0000269,how trust and distrust shape perception and memory,"Trust is a key ingredient in decision making, as it allows us to rely on the information we receive. Although trust is usually viewed as a positive element of decision making, we suggest that its effects on memory are costly rather than beneficial. Across nine studies using three different manipulations of trust and distrust and three different memory paradigms, we find that trust reduces memory performance as compared with distrust. In Study 1, trust leads to higher acceptance rates of misinformation. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrate that participants in a distrust and a control condition perform better at a memoryrecognition task than participants in a trust condition. Studies 3a and 3b show that trust also reduces free recall of memory content. Examining the underlying mechanism, we find that reduced memory performance in a state of trust is caused by an increased perception of similarities between items that are to be memorized. Following a causal chain design, Study 4 shows that trust increases the sensitivity to similarities as compared with distrust and a control condition, and Study 5 shows that a processing focus on similarities reduces memory accuracy. Studies 6 and 7 create circumstances that either leave the proposed mediator free to vary or interrupt it via the induction of a similarity-focus (Study 6) or a difference- focus (Study 7). The disadvantage of trust is only present if the mediating processing focus can freely operate. Overall, these studies show that trust impairs memory performance due to an increased perception of similarities between memory content © 2021 American Psychological Association",
10.1177/2053168021993979,how populism and conservative media fuel conspiracy beliefs about covid-19 and what it means for covid-19 behaviors,"Research examining attitudes and behaviors of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on partisanship as a lens through which many Americans see the coronavirus. Given the importance of partisan affiliation and the degree of partisan polarization in the American society, that is certainly an important driver of public opinion, and a necessary one to understand. But an overlooked set of predispositions might also shape COVID beliefs and attitudes: populism. It is a worldview that pits average citizens against “the elites” and, importantly in the context of a pandemic, it includes anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including scientists). We find that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship. Furthermore, we find that conservative media consumption tends to be a stronger predictor of conspiracy belief among those high in populism than among those low in populism. We also show that these beliefs have consequences: those who believe the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are less likely to adapt behaviors recommended by public health officials. © The Author(s) 2021.",
10.3390/rel11110622,teaching jihad: developing religious literacy through graphic novels,"This study examined the representations of jihad in graphic novels to ascertain how its depictions may inform the development of religious literacy in secondary classrooms. Hegemonic constructions of jihad in the West are commonly reduced to false binaries that shape non-Muslims’ extant beliefs and perceptions of Islam and Muslims. This raises concerns about the ways in which societal expectations shape knowledge formation in schools. Accordingly, this critical content analysis explored the depiction of jihad in three graphic novel memoirs, an increasingly popular medium of instruction in secondary classrooms. Our analysis identified three forms of jihad conveyed through the graphic novels, specifically: jihad for education, jihad for gender justice, and jihad for identity. These representations provide robust counternarratives and suggest the value of teaching religious concepts through graphic novels as a way to develop deeper understandings and counter misinformation. The article concludes with six recommendations for educators to consider when teaching religious content through contemporary graphic novels. © 2020 by the authors.

10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104453,the rational continued influence of misinformation,"Misinformation has become an increasingly topical field of research. Studies on the ‘Continued Influence Effect’ (CIE) show that misinformation continues to influence reasoning despite subsequent retraction. Current explanatory theories of the CIE tacitly assume continued reliance on misinformation is the consequence of a biased process. In the present work, we show why this perspective may be erroneous. Using a Bayesian formalism, we conceptualize the CIE as a scenario involving contradictory testimonies and incorporate the previously overlooked factors of the temporal dependence (misinformation precedes its retraction) between, and the perceived reliability of, misinforming and retracting sources. When considering such factors, we show the CIE to have normative backing. We demonstrate that, on aggregate, lay reasoners (N = 101) intuitively endorse the necessary assumptions that demarcate CIE as a rational process, still exhibit the standard effect, and appropriately penalize the reliability of contradicting sources. Individual-level analyses revealed that although many participants endorsed assumptions for a rational CIE, very few were able to execute the complex model update that the Bayesian model entails. In sum, we provide a novel illustration of the pervasive influence of misinformation as the consequence of a rational process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
10.1080/17457289.2021.1924746,the path from distrusting western actors to conspiracy beliefs and noncompliance with public health guidance during the covid-19 crisis,"Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of disinformation and conspiracy narratives that feed on the people’s distrust of institutions. We investigate perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania during the lockdown and the state of alert (April and July 2020) using survey data. Building on measures tested in previous research, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. We test whether individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations. We find an indirect relationship between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn are associated with reduced compliance with official guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. The findings highlight potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic, especially in the young democracies of Eastern Europe. © 2021 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.",

The research conducted aims to fill the gap of literature related to social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research aims at uncovering the influences of social media use in several dimensions during lockdown(s). The study aims to answer the research question of: Are the influences of social media use different from normal times? The online questionnaire has been completed by six hundred and sixty-eight users within the period of lockdown. The author prepared the questionnaire, which is composed of 22 positive statements in order to evaluate the effects of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 5 point Likert scale was used, where reliability and validity were calculated by the Cronbach's alpha value, which was 0.751. Findings highlight that users have more information about COVID-19, and they follow recent information via social media, which shows the shift towards digital medium. Findings also indicate that users are aware of fake news, and they follow official sources. Social media is powerful to affect decision-makers, and respondents' social media use did not create any panic or anxiety amongst them. This research indicates that respondents' social media use during COVID-19 is different from normal times as a common purpose triggers this, survival. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most of social media shares were like a dream or a strong desire that may cause anxiety in others. During the pandemic, people are in lockdown and share similar feelings and follow similar behavioural patterns. As there is a common purpose and struggle via users, psychological well-being is not affected negatively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Nevertheless, the general public view of these therapies remains relatively unexplored. Our study identifies the social factors that determine a person’s trust in alternative therapies, like homeopathy or acupuncture, drawing conclusions from the results of the Spanish National Survey on the Social Perception of Science and Technology (N = 6,357). We show that trust in the effectiveness of CAM therapies is not mutually exclusive with a belief in science for the general public, pointing to a certain level of disinformation. The comparison with superstitions confirms a clear differentiation with the drivers of trust in analyzed CAM therapies. We argue that scientific appearance of these alternative therapies, in terms of prescription, communication and marketing, may play an important role in determining trust in them for a large part of the population. Furthermore, we confirm that women and those with higher socio-economic status are more likely to express trust in the effectiveness of CAM therapies. Additionally, distrust of the influence of big pharma on health policies seems to have an effect on viewing CAM therapies as more effective. Finally, we argue that media and pharmacies may have an effect on the scientific-like perception of CAM therapies, contributing to the social construction of trust in its effectiveness. Therefore, widespread confusion about the scientific validation of homeopathy may be among the main factors driving its successful extension as a practice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1038/s41598-020-67744-6,the pervasiveness and policy consequences of medical folk wisdom in the u.s.,"Medical folk wisdom (MFW) refers to widely held, but factually inaccurate, beliefs about disease, immunity, pregnancy, and other medically-relevant topics. Examples include the idea that fasting when feverish (“starving a fever”) can increase the pace of recovery, or that showering after sex can prevent pregnancy. The pervasiveness of MFW, and whether or not it—like other forms of medically-relevant misinformation—shapes Americans’ health behaviors and policy preferences is an important and under-studied question. We begin this research by proposing and validating a novel measure of MFW; including a short-form scale suitable for administration in public opinion surveys. We find that nearly all Americans—irrespective of socio-economic status, political orientation, and educational background—endorse at least some aspects of MFW. Concerningly, and consistent with the idea that folk wisdom challenges scientific expertise, we additionally find that those highest in MFW tend to place less value on medical expertise and the role experts play in shaping health policy. However, this skepticism does not appear to translate to peoples’ health actions, as MFW appears to have an inconsistent effect on public participation in healthy behaviors. © 2020, The Author(s).",
10.1371/journal.pone.0243024,"myths, beliefs, and perceptions about covid-19 in ethiopia: a need to address information gaps and enable combating efforts","Background The endeavor to tackle the spread of COVID-19 effectively remains futile without the right grasp of perceptions and beliefs presiding in the community. Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Methods An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value <0.05. Results A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include people’s perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p <0.05). Conclusions Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures. All forms of media should be properly used and regulated to disseminate credible information while filtering out myths and falsehoods. © 2020 Kebede et al.

10.1017/aju.2021.4,defending weapons inspections from the effects of disinformation,"The intentional spread of disinformation is not a new challenge for the scientific world. We have seen it perpetuate the idea of a flat earth, convince communities that vaccines are more dangerous than helpful, and even suggest a connection between the “5G” communication infrastructure and COVID-19.1 Nor is disinformation a new phenomenon in the weapons inspection arena. Weapons inspectors themselves are often forced to sift through alternative narratives of events and inconsistent reporting, and they regularly see their credibility and conclusions questioned in the face of government politics or public biases. But certain recent disinformation campaigns have become so overwhelmingly comprehensive and effective that they constitute a new kind of threat. By preventing accountability for clear violations of international law, these campaigns have created a challenge to the survival of arms control treaties themselves. If weapons inspectors cannot regain the trust of the international community in the face of this challenge, it will be increasingly difficult to ensure compliance with arms control and disarmament treaties going forward. In this essay, I will briefly discuss one of the most comprehensive disinformation efforts of the past decade: the disinformation campaign used to prevent accountability for Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons. After this discussion, I will propose one possible approach to help protect the credibility of disarmament experts and weapons inspectors in the face of pervasive disinformation. This approach will require a concerted effort to connect and support compliance experts and to understand and explain their expertise across cultural, political, national, economic, and religious divides. © Mallory Stewart 2021.

Rumor initiators seek social networks vulnerable to illimitable spread, therefore, online social media becomes their stage. Hence, this misinformation imposes colossal damage to individuals, organizations, and the government, etc. Existing work, analyzing temporal and linguistic characteristics of rumors seems to give ample time for rumor propagation. Meanwhile, with the huge outburst of data on social media, studying these characteristics for each tweet becomes spatially complex. Therefore, in this article, a two-fold supervised machine-learning framework is proposed that detects rumors by filtering and then analyzing their linguistic properties. This method attempts to automate filtering by training multiple classification algorithms with accuracy higher than 81.079%. Finally, using textual characteristics on the filtered data, rumors are detected. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is shown through extensive experiments on over 10,000 tweets. © 2021, IGI Global.",

The dangerous issue is that misinformation, fake news, and rumours spread on social media faster than reliable information, and also faster than the virus itself, damaging the health systems and affecting the mental health of social media users. Objective: The current study aims at determining how social media affects the spread of panic about COVID-19 among primary and secondary school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. Methods: The data were collected through an online questionnaire. By utilizing convenience sampling, we have reached a total of 1067 school students, aged between 6 and 18 years, from 56 schools located in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. Independent Samples T-test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests were used to compare the data. Results: The results showed that social media has a significant impact on spreading panic about COVID-19 among school students, with a potential negative impact on their mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most common social media platform among students (81.8%), where female students had a higher likelihood than male students to use it to get news about COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Health news was the most frequently topic seen, read, or heard (n = 529, 56.2%) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where males were more likely to follow health news than females (p < 0.001). The majority of the students (n = 736, 78.1%) were psychologically affected, whereas those physically affected were the lowest (n = 12, 1.3%). Female students were psychologically affected and experienced greater fear significantly more than male students (p < 0.001). The effect of social media panic depending on a student's age and gender. (p < 0.001). This study showed a significant positive correlation between social media and spreading panic about COVID-19 (R = 0.891). Conclusions: During the closure of schools, students are using social media to continue their learning as well as to know more information about the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media has a main role in rapidly spreading of panic about the COVID-19 pandemic among students in the Gaza Strip. © 2020",
10.7195/RI14.V19I1.1621,"ethical engagement, responsibility and strategic communication in the digital era: practitioners' approaches","Digital communication channels can be subject to exploitation, resulting in harming individuals or societies by promoting fake news, disinformation, radicalization, or social polarization. It is important that communicators are well prepared in identifying, preventing, and responding to such actions, in understanding the vulnerabilities of their audience, while respecting the rights and liberties of the population. Thus, ethical, and strategic communication should be of top priority for institutional communicators, academia, journalists, or stakeholders when addressing security or sensitive issues. The article presents the results of an empirical sociological study, part of an extensive exploratory research within the CRESCEnt project, aiming at identifying elements of enhancing critical thinking, responsible communication, and accountable behaviour. Three European states were targeted by the study: Romania, Spain, and Greece, while 28 practitioners in communication, intelligence and security and law enforcement contributed to the research with significant input on topics related to ethical, successful, and strategic communication characteristics. Ethical communication implies acting by ethical principles, like being truthful, accurate, and well-intentioned. Responsibility is the central element of ethical engagement when informing the public. Effective messages are characterized by clearness, validity of information, novelty and presented in real time. Different types of authorities come into action for the communicators, such as the journalism code of practice, European values, or possible negative social impact. © 2021 Scientific Association Icono14.

10.1080/10410236.2020.1838094,advancing visual health communication research to improve infodemic response,"During public health crises like the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, there is a need to amplify and improve critical health communication messages. This need is due to pandemics producing infodemic conditions, meaning the public information environment is oversaturated with information of questionable accuracy and utility. The strategic use of visuals can be leveraged to improve the quality of health communication during public health crises and lessen the unintended effects of infodemic conditions. In this essay, we review previous visual communication theorizing and research that provide insights for effective and efficient use of graphical (e.g., data visualizations) and illustrative (e.g., photos, illustrations, and content features) visuals. We also discuss and advocate for more systematic research on visual misinformation and visual narratives, as there are significant gaps in the literature about how people interpret, act on, and engage with these visual content types. More systematic research about these areas of visual health communication research will improve public communication during future public health crises. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.4018/978-1-7998-7291-7.ch031,news credibility and media literacy in the digital age,"With the hostile media phenomenon as an overarching framework, this chapter discusses how challenging it can be for media literacy education to successfully combat motivated reasoning in which individuals are likely to be hostile when exposed to news content that is incongruent with their personal point of view. Such discussion is vital in times when news audiences are cynical and skeptical towards both politicians and media agencies. Given the importance of understanding and studying individuals' perceptions of news biases and assessments of news credibility, this chapter makes a case for establishing more objective standards for journalistic work to overcome the challenges brought about by the rise of fake news in the digital era. © 2021, IGI Global.",
NA,russian disinformation threat: comparative case study of czech and slovak approaches; [ruska dezinformacijska nevarnost: primerjalna študija čeških in slovaških pristopov],"This comparative case analysis focuses on the approaches of the Czech and Slovak governments to Russian disinformation activities, with particular attention to the securitization of the threat. The paper argues that the extent of energy relations with Russia plays an important role in the securitization of the threat posed by the said state. It employs a rational model of policy-making to better understand the rationale for the decisions of the actors leading to the different approaches taken by the governments of the examined states. The analysis shows that while the Czech approach seems to be driven mostly by security interests, in Slovakia, the economic goals are of primary importance, with the primary factor being the importance of energy relations with Russia. The Czech approach is considered as an appropriate one in this paper, as it allows for more objective threat assessment and consequently better preparedness and resilience, whereas a rather pragmatic approach of Slovakia leads to increasing vulnerability of disinformation activities. ◎ 2021, University of Ljubljana.

In the current paper, we present the results of an online experiment using a sample of self-identified conservatives and liberals on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Across several statements on various political issues, participants were randomly assigned to receive a corrective message, polling information about the factual beliefs of members from the partisan out-group, or both. We find that while the corrective message improved belief accuracy, information about the out-group did not influence belief accuracy either directly or by moderating the influence of corrections–even among those with the strongest antipathy toward the out-party. We discuss the implications of the results for the role of negative partisanship for misinformation and corrective messages. ©, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Within the infodemic context, we analysed the accuracy of the information and the reliability of the websites that guided the debate. Our results show that misinformation/disinformation accounted for 13.5% of the sample and that their average engagement was greater than the one for the information that could be verified in other sources and in accordance with scientific evidence. We also found that professional websites, especially journalistic ones, predominate among sources.

This chapter conceived fake news within the milieu of influencing information spread in the society, especially on the cyberspace. Using the hierarchy of influence model trajectory with fake news, it was established that it has become almost impossible to sustain trust and credibility through individual influences on online news content. The primary reason is that journalists are constrained by professional ethics, organizational routines, and ownership influence. Rather than verify facts and offer supporting claims, online users without professional orientation engage in a reproducing information indiscreetly.

10.1371/journal.pone.0243704,cyberchondria in the age of covid-19,"The global epidemic of (mis)information, spreading rapidly via social media platforms and other outlets, can be a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders among vulnerable individuals. Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated.

10.1080/14797585.2021.1886420,"what should academics do about conspiracy theories? moving beyond debunking to better deal with conspiratorial movements, misinformation and post-truth","Many people use conspiracy theories to make sense of a changing world and its ever more complexif social structures (e.g., international financial systems, global bodies of governance), tragic events (e.g., terrorist attacks, man-made catastrophes, or natural disasters), or socio-political and economic issues (e.g., security, migration, distribution of resources, health care). The widespread flourishing of conspiracy theories in this context has prompted much interest from the academic community. There is often an expectation that it is the responsibility of researchers to engage with conspiracy beliefs by debunking them. However, like everything that relates to conspiracy theories, even the subject of debunking is not straightforward. An answer to the question as to whether researchers should debunk conspiracy theories varies across disciplines and schools, and is closely related to specific ethical codes of conduct, research methodologies, and specific approaches to conspiracy theories. While scholars who study this cultural phenomenon from a non-normative and epistemologically neutral position might wish to refrain from debunking conspiracy theories, others who see conspiracy theories as the irrational, overly suspicious and even dangerous ideas of people who don’t quite understand what is ‘really’ going on, might lean towards the debunking stance. In this special issue, we explore different approaches that academics may take in relation to conspiracy theories. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1007/s11896-019-09361-2,"intelligence, authority and blame conformity: co-witness influence is moderated by the perceived competence of the information source","Previous research suggests that co-witness influence is heavily dependent on how eyewitnesses perceive the source of information, with perceived credibility, authority and memory accuracy identified as significant predictors. However, very little research has directly investigated the effects of perceived intelligence on co-witness influence. The present study used confederates to expose participants (N = 182) to misinformation about a witnessed event, prior to collecting their statements. Participants were paired up with a confederate who was presented as either a PhD student (high intelligence), police officer (high authority), neutral (no information provided) or completed the study individually (control). Results found that participants were significantly more likely to blame the wrong person for the crime if it had been suggested to them by a police officer or PhD student.

10.1111/ajps.12535,partisan gaps in political information and information-seeking behavior: motivated reasoning or cheerleading?,"Do partisan disagreements over politically relevant facts, and preferences for the information sources from which to obtain them, represent genuine differences of opinion or insincere cheerleading? The answer to this question is crucial for understanding the scope of partisan polarization. We test between these alternatives with experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow respondents to search for information before answering each question. We find that partisan cheerleading inflates divides in factual information, but only modestly. Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in information search; these divides are no different from those that occur outside the survey context when we examine web-browsing data from the same respondents. Overall, our findings support the motivated reasoning interpretation of misinformation; partisans seek out information with congenial slant and sincerely adopt inaccurate beliefs that cast their party in a favorable light. ©2020, Midwest Political Science Association",
10.1080/10410236.2020.1847437,association of covid-19 misinformation with face mask wearing and social distancing in a nationally representative us sample,"Wide-spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for communicating public health recommendations. Should campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S. adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n = 1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n = 889; follow-up response 83%). Scales were developed and validated for COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors. Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated with both face mask wearing (B = −.27, SE =.06) and social-distancing behaviors (B = −.46, SE =.08) measured at the same time, misinformation did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both cross-sectionally (B =.43, SE =.05; B =.63, SE =.09) and lagged over time (B =.20, SE = 04; B =.30, SE =.08). In conclusion, belief in COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

In two experiments, we examined the misinformation effect for non-witnessed details (i.e., absent). Three question types introduced control, misleading, and absent details (closed, closed-detailed, and open questions) about a mock burglary video. On this misinformation test, participants' reports of absent details were less accurate than control details only when they were introduced using open questions. Misinformation effects in a subsequent recognition test were present for misleading details in both experiments, but for absent details only in Experiment 2. Experiment 2 also revealed that participants who avoided answering open questions containing misleading and absent details had more accurate memories for these details on the subsequent recognition test than participants who answered these questions. In both experiments, confidence was lowest for absent details. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

10.1371/journal.pone.0235971,"abortion attitudes, religious and moral beliefs, and pastoral care among protestant religious leaders in georgia","Objective The purpose of this study is to explore Protestant religious leaders’ attitudes towards abortion and their strategies for pastoral care in Georgia, USA. Religious leaders may play an important role in providing sexual and reproductive health pastoral care given a long history of supporting healing and health promotion. Methods We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders on their attitudes toward abortion and how they provide pastoral care for abortion. The study was conducted in a county with relatively higher rates of abortion, lower access to sexual and reproductive health services, higher religiosity, and greater denominational diversity compared to other counties in the state. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by thematic analysis. Results Religious leaders’ attitudes towards abortion fell on a spectrum from “pro-life” to “pro-choice”. However, most participants expressed attitudes in the middle of this spectrum and described more nuanced, complex, and sometimes contradictory views. Differences in abortion attitudes stemmed from varying beliefs on when life begins and circumstances in which abortion may be morally acceptable. Religious leaders described their pastoral care on abortion as “journeying with” congregants by advising them to make well-informed decisions irrespective of the religious leader’s own attitudes. However, many religious leaders described a lack of preparation and training to have these conversations. Leaders emphasized not condoning abortion, yet being willing to emotionally support women because spiritual leaders are compelled to love and provide pastoral care. Paradoxically, all leaders emphasized the importance of empathy and compassion for people who have unplanned pregnancies, yet only leaders whose attitudes were “pro-choice” or in the middle of the spectrum expressed an obligation to confront stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards people who experience abortion. Additionally, many leaders offer misinformation about abortion when offering pastoral care. Conclusion These findings contribute to limited empirical evidence on pastoral care for abortion. We found religious leaders hold diverse attitudes and beliefs about abortion, rooted in Christian scripture and doctrine that inform advice and recommendations to congregants. While religious leaders may have formal training on pastoral care in general or theological education on the ethical issues related to abortion, they struggle to integrate their knowledge and training across these two areas. Still, leaders could be potentially important resources for empathy, compassion, and affirmation of agency in abortion decision-making, particularly in the Southern United States. © 2020 Dozier et al.

10.1353/JKR.2020.0004,"text beyond context: power, discourse, and the chong kam nok in colonial korea","This article explores how the Chong Kam nok (Chong's prophecies) persisted as a subversive text that helped Koreans envision the new world order when the Japanese empire sought to regulate belief systems and dominate public discourse about religion in colonial Korea. As a collection of handwritten prognostication texts that contain sources of political disinformation against the Choson dynasty, the Chong Kam nok was widely read and transmitted by word of mouth across the country from the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. The book foretold the fall of the Yi royal house and the founding of a new regime by a ""true man"" whose surname was Chong. When Choson Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, however, that prognostic claim turned out to be false because it was the Japanese, rather than a man named Chong, who overthrew the dynasty. Although the Chong Kam nok's predictions were wildly inaccurate, many Koreans still believed its radical message and reinterpreted it for their own political ends during the colonial period. Both Japanese authorities and Korean reformers vilified the Chong Kam nok as a superstitious tradition and suppressed its oral influence through various measures. Despite state persecution, the Chong Kam nok survived and provided discontented Koreans under colonial rule with a redemptive vision of the future and an ideological basis for their struggle for national independence. While previous studies have analyzed the textual meanings of the Chong Kam nok and examined its impact on peasant uprisings in premodern Korea, this article illuminates the complicated dynamics of colonial power and discourse surrounding the Chong Kam nok, a text that remained deeply embedded in the popular beliefs of the Korean people. © 2020 University of Hawaii Press.

10.1016/j.actpsy.2019.102986,long-lasting positive effects of collaborative remembering on false assents to misleading questions,"Previous studies showed that collaborative remembering can reduce false memories through a process of mutual error checking, although conclusions were limited by the nature of the memory tasks (very few errors). The present experiments extend these findings to eyewitness memory by using a paradigm designed to increase the frequency of memory errors. Collaborative and nominal pairs viewed a video-clip illustrating a bank robbery, provided an immediate free recall, were forced to confabulate answers to false-event questions, and, after a short- (1 h: Experiment 1) or a long-term delay (1 week: Experiment 2), were administered a yes/no recognition task in which the misleading statements either matched the questions presented in the confabulation phase (answered questions) or not (control questions). Collaborative pairs recalled fewer correct details in the immediate free recall task, replicating the negative effects of collaborative inhibition. Most importantly, in the final recognition test, collaborative pairs were less likely to provide false assents to misleading statements, regardless of whether they had provided a response to the related false-event questions 1 h or 1 week earlier. Our results suggest that collaboration can increase the eyewitnesses' tendency to check the accuracy of others' responses and reject false memories through discussion. © 2019 The Authors",

Participants (n = 264) viewed a video depicting a crime and completed a memory questionnaire immediately afterwards and 1 week later. Memory specificity was measured using the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT). Higher AMT scores were associated with better memory accuracy. Performance was worse in the high load compared to the low load condition at immediate recall. However, this effect was not seen for every question and load did not influence eyewitness identifications. To test the possibility that load effects were not fully captured by the questionnaire in experiment 1, we conducted a second experiment (n = 120) where we systematically manipulated misinformation about central and peripheral details. We found no effects. Our findings suggest that high perceptual load enhances eyewitness suggestibility, while specific autobiographical memory protects against misinformation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

An acute form of this problem is that children and adolescents tend to include the use of new technologies in all the aspects of their daily life, yet most of them are unable to distinguish between fake news and trustful information in an online environment. This study is based on a Dutch empirical study and was conducted in Romania to examine whether schoolchildren and adolescents were able to identify a hoax website as fake, using a self-administrative questionnaire and open group discussions about the given online source. Similar to other studies based on the same research design, this research aims to explore the vulnerability of students to fake news and the way they experience an experimental situation in which they are exposed to online fake information. This exploratory study revealed that both children and adolescents are not preoccupied with the trustworthiness of the information they are exposed to in social media. While only 4 of the 54 students stated that they would not choose to save a fake animal (from a hoax website), all four of them had reasons that proved that they did not perceive the information as being a hoax. Thus, participants proved that they would act upon being exposed to fake information even when they do not trust the source. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113356,conspiracy theories as barriers to controlling the spread of covid-19 in the u.s.,"Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to public health. Objective: Because the novel coronavirus is highly contagious, the widespread use of preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and eventually vaccination is needed to bring it under control. We hypothesized that accepting conspiracy theories that were circulating in mainstream and social media early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US would be negatively related to the uptake of preventive behaviors and also of vaccination when a vaccine becomes available. Method: A national probability survey of US adults (N = 1050) was conducted in the latter half of March 2020 and a follow-up with 840 of the same individuals in July 2020. The surveys assessed adoption of preventive measures recommended by public health authorities, vaccination intentions, conspiracy beliefs, perceptions of threat, belief about the safety of vaccines, political ideology, and media exposure patterns. Results: Belief in three COVID-19-related conspiracy theories was highly stable across the two periods and inversely related to the (a) perceived threat of the pandemic, (b) taking of preventive actions, including wearing a face mask, (c) perceived safety of vaccination, and (d) intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conspiracy beliefs in March predicted subsequent mask-wearing and vaccination intentions in July even after controlling for action taken and intentions in March. Although adopting preventive behaviors was predicted by political ideology and conservative media reliance, vaccination intentions were less related to political ideology. Mainstream television news use predicted adopting both preventive actions and vaccination. Conclusions: Because belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the US. Reducing those barriers will require continued messaging by public health authorities on mainstream media and in particular on politically conservative outlets that have supported COVID-related conspiracy theories. © 2020 The Author(s)",

NA,the accuracy crisis of (online) journalism in turkey: unverified news reports during the 2018 presidential campaign,"With the ever-increasing Internet penetration rates in Turkey, different types of information disorder which spread through social media started to shape public and political agenda as never seen before. The number of false news stories generated with the intention of spreading either disinformation or ""malinformation"" (targeting reputation of political candidates) typically increase dramatically during election campaign periods. As such, before the 2018 presidential elections in Turkey, in which Tayyip Erdogan won by getting nearly 53% of the votes and got new executive powers, a heated debate between the two opposing camps of the election campaign not only spread to the digital platforms, but also the false news in digital platforms were used in different proportions in the political campaigns. The Turkish news verification initiative teyit.org had detected 29 major different false news claims in circulation across the social media in the two-month period before the elections. However, among 136 social media accounts, which circulate these claims that reach hundreds of thousands of people, not all are anonymous or a ""troll"" social media accounts. In fact, considerable percentage of those accounts belong to well-known news outlets, which take viral social media content as a news source without verifying. In this chapter, the aim is to demonstrate the spread of information disorder in an election period through internet news sites by analyzing the raw data gathered by teyit.org. Emphasis will also be given to the ""correction"" or removal rates of false news from these sites after verification proves them false in order to understand the spillover effect and the ""survival"" rate of disinformation against truth. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

10.37016/mr-2020-55,"right and left, partisanship predicts (asymmetric) vulnerability to misinformation","We analyze the relationship between partisanship, echo chambers, and vulnerability to online misinformation by studying news sharing behavior on Twitter. While our results confirm prior findings that online misinformation sharing is strongly correlated with right-leaning partisanship, we also uncover a similar, though weaker, trend among left-leaning users. Because of the correlation between a user’s partisanship and their position within a partisan echo chamber, these types of influence are confounded. To disentangle their effects, we performed a regression analysis and found that vulnerability to misinformation is most strongly influenced by partisanship for both left-and right-leaning users. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants’ exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information. The findings contribute to misinformation research by providing a formula for correcting the increasing spread of misinformation in times of crisis. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

10.1111/ssqu.12839,analysis of youths’ perspective in india on and during the pandemic of covid-19,"Objective: In this COVID-19 pandemic, there are not many sound studies focusing on the extensive socioeconomic impact ushered in with this disaster. This work aims to understand the thought of the youth, their opinions and understanding of various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: Using a combined qualitative–quantitative approach, Q-method, we tried to assess people's discernment from different perspectives. This was done through a questionnaire survey method during the national-level lockdown 1.0 in India. Results: We have differentiated the perceptions of youth respondents into seven factors, including six subdimensions, on COVID-19 pandemic (viz., science, society, environment, economy, politics, and religion). The choices and opinions have been segregated into two major groups: quantitative and qualitative. Conclusion: This work yielded a firsthand ground-level insight into the comprehensive yet diverse responses from youths regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in India. There are various topics that arise from this study, for example, misinformation, misinterpretation of science, dubious nature of faith in governance and policy, turbid understanding of strategy, polarization of opinion, and so forth. Following this work of identification, the next steps would be to understand how to mitigate the problems toward betterment in the COVID-19 pandemic situation or similar widespread crisis events in the foreseeable future. © 2020 by the Southwestern Social Science Association",

Therefore, social media users should not simply believe the information they received. This paper investigates the process of evaluating news on social media carried out by students in assessing the news they find on social media, and their ability to distinguish fact and false news. Purpose: It is to find out more about the process of students evaluating news on social media by assessing the news they found on social media, and how can they know which is the factual news and which is the fake news and the difference between them. Method: Qualitative research methods with a descriptive approach are used in this research. This research was conducted at Gadjah Mada University. The purposive sampling technique was chosen to be used in determining students. Findings: Overall, participants were able to identify almost all news articles. Participants are able to identify almost all factual news articles correctly and most fake news articles correctly. Only a small portion of all news articles cannot be correctly identified by participants. Participants are better to identify factual news than fake news. Conclusion: Although participants already have experienced finding fake news on social media and have self-taught knowledge about how to distinguish fake news from reliable news, there is no guarantee that they can tell the news article they got, fake or fact. The researcher wants to give advice to the academic library to provide training on the characteristics of reliable referral sources and to think critically in assessing information as part of student information literacy training. © 2020, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.

10.1027/1618-3169/a000489,anger increases susceptibility to misinformation,"The effect of anger on acceptance of false details was examined using a three-phase misinformation paradigm. Participants viewed an event, were presented with schema-consistent and schema-irrelevant misinformation about it, and were given a surprise source monitoring test to examine the acceptance of the suggested material. Between each phase of the experiment, they performed a task that either induced anger or maintained a neutral mood. Participants showed greater susceptibility to schema-consistent than schema-irrelevant misinformation. Anger did not affect either recognition or source accuracy for true details about the initial event, but suggestibility for false details increased with anger. In spite of this increase in source errors (i.e., misinformation acceptance), both confidence in the accuracy of source attributions and decision speed for incorrect judgments also increased with anger. Implications are discussed with respect to both the general effects of anger and real-world applications such as eyewitness memory. © 2020 Hogrefe Publishing.",
10.1177/1354068817749777,who do you believe? political parties and conspiracy theories in pakistan,"In authoritarian states, emerging democracies, and well-established democracies alike, alternative accounts that contest official state narratives are common. Why do people believe such accounts even in the absence of supporting evidence? While this question has been explored in the United States, relatively little research has assessed it in other contexts. Through a survey experiment carried out in Pakistan, this article tests the impact of cues by political parties on belief in such conspiracy theories. The results provide evidence in favor of partisan cueing: When alternative narratives are endorsed by political parties viewed favorably by the respondent, they are more likely to be believed. I suggest that political parties are able to capitalize on misinformation and a lack of trust in official institutions for tactical advantage. Results differ by subgroup: Higher income and urban respondents are swayed more by their own party source than are lower income and rural individuals. © The Author(s) 2018.",

Also, the received information can be distorted by psychological biases. This is problematic especially in health-related communications which can greatly affect the quality of life of individuals. We assembled and analyzed 364 texts related to nutrition and health from Finnish online sources, such as news, columns and blogs, and asked non-experts to subjectively evaluate the texts. Texts were rated for their trustworthiness, sentiment, logic, information, clarity, and neutrality properties. We then estimated individual biases and consensus ratings that were used in training regression models. Firstly, we found that trustworthiness was significantly correlated to the information, neutrality and logic of the texts. Secondly, individual ratings for information and logic were significantly biased by the age and diet of the raters. Our best regression models explained up to 70% of the total variance of consensus ratings based on the low-level properties of texts, such as semantic embeddings, presence of keyterms and part-of-speech tags, references, quotes and paragraphs. With a novel combination of crowdsourcing, behavioral analysis, natural language processing and predictive modeling, our study contributes to the automated identification of reliable and high-quality online information. While critical evaluation of truthfulness cannot be surrendered to the machine only, our findings provide new insights into automated evaluation of subjective text properties and analysis of morphologically-rich languages in regards to trustworthiness. © 2020 Kauttonen et al.

10.1016/j.jarmac.2020.04.001,correcting misinformation in news stories: an investigation of correction timing and correction durability,"Early reports of an unfolding news story sometimes contain incomplete or mistaken information that is later updated or corrected. Research shows that retracted information continues to influence beliefs and inferential reasoning in sometimes subtle ways. The present study sought to assess how the efficacy of corrections interacts with the passage of time. We assessed whether delaying a correction by 2 days, relative to providing the correction minutes after the mistaken information, influenced the efficacy of the correction. In the same experiments, we also assessed whether corrections lead to durable changes in belief, by assessing belief in the corrected information in the same individuals at several points in time. Although we found no evidence that correction timing mattered, we found clear evidence that corrected beliefs were not durable. In three experiments, belief in the mistaken information increased over the 2 days following a correction despite participants’ continued memory for the correction. © 2020 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition",
10.1002/acp.3685,reinforced self-affirmation as a method for reducing eyewitness memory conformity: an experimental examination using a modified mori technique,"The manuscript describes an experimental investigation of one possible technique that may reduce memory conformity: the reinforced self-affirmation procedure (RSA). While previous studies have already demonstrated the RSA's effectiveness in reducing other memory distortions (e.g., the misinformation effect and interrogative suggestibility), this has not been tested in the context of the co-witness memory conformity effect. To this end, we will utilize the well-known MORI technique to study co-witness memory conformity under well-controlled experimental conditions. While viewing different versions of the same movie, pairs of participants will sit beside each other, believing that they are viewing the same version. Next, they will answer questions collaboratively, which will guide them to discuss conflicting details. Finally, participants will take a recognition test individually, but in the experimental condition, this will be proceeded by the RSA procedure, which is expected to be an effective way of eliminating the effect of memory conformity. If reinforcing one's own confidence reduces the plausible memory conformity effect, it may be then argued that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is the participants' lack of confidence relating to quality of their memory. As argued in the present paper, these results will open up a set of interesting questions for future research. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
NA,online foreign news: are we capable of recognizing manipulation? the role of political competence and media literacy context,"The proliferation of new media technologies and the Internet, in particular, has contributed greatly to making various kinds of biased media information widely distributed and, seemingly, 'prevalent' in news coverage of certain topics. While purposefully developed online services for fact-checking and overall reliability of news may be helpful in some situations, personal abilities to recognize manipulation and misinformation according to its certain characteristics and owing to certain individual skills and competencies appear to be more important. This chapter introduces the concept of 'manipulated media information' and is focused on the investigation of the effects of individual levels of political competence and the media literacy context on spotting manipulated information in Internet news reports on foreign affairs issues as well as on the acceptance/rejection dichotomy of the standpoint(s) such news reports promote. The basis of the investigation is a series of experiments (N = 914) conducted in three European countries, differing in their levels of media literacy context - Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands. University students in the age category of 18-26 years old, which is usually referred to as 'heavy Internet users,' from the three countries were the target group of participants in this research. Analysis revealed that political competence appeared to have no effects at all on spotting and rejecting manipulated information both in 'traditional' and 'alternative' Internet news sources. However, participants from countries ranked with a higher media literacy context were more likely to spot manipulation and reject the promoted standpoint(s). In addition, a puzzling relationship was discovered between spotting and rejecting, as not everyone who spotted manipulation subsequently rejected the manipulated standpoint, but accepted it instead. The chapter discusses these findings as well as other factors, particularly, media trust and sources' trustworthiness, within the context of manipulated information. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

10.1371/journal.pone.0239826,comparing covariation among vaccine hesitancy and broader beliefs within twitter and survey data,"Over the past decade, the percentage of adults in the United States who use some form of social media has roughly doubled, increasing from 36 percent in early 2009 to 72 percent in 2019. There has been a corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate. Social media platforms are conduits of both information and misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a nationally representative survey of parents in the United States informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics, including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from 2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in 2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and scores of the first principal components obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs. volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as assessing belief covariation. Copyright: © 2020 Nowak et al.

Photograph courtesy of Eloisa Lopez. Duterte, Overseas Filipino Workers, and the Ethics of Representation Ethel Tungohan Although the problem persists I really do believe the photographs put a face to the numbers. They allowed more people to witness the harrowing things we saw. More organizations were spurred to action from the reporting. None of this would have come to light if not for the very first wave of local reporters saying: this really is happening. —­ Hannah Reyes Morales, “Coming Home to Cover Duterte’s Deadly Drug War” Consisting primarily of former and current migrant workers who came to Canada under the low-­ skilled Temporary Foreign Workers Program (TFWP), members of the Filipino diaspora in Edmonton, Alberta, have oftentimes expressed to me their disillusionment with the way politics was conducted back home, the economic conditions that led them to 14 Codex seek jobs abroad in the first place, and the sacrifices they underwent in Canada. Living and working in Canada did not mean that they were uninvolved with events in the Philippines. On the contrary, being migrant workers abroad with obligations to send remittances to family and other loved ones in the Philippines meant that they maintained transnational ties. I actually first heard about Rodrigo Duterte first announcing his candidacy for president from them. Despite favorable media depictions of the progress former president Benigno Aquino Jr. has made, which included “rapid economic growth of 6.9% and improved performance in global competitiveness rankings (from 86th place to 47th)” (Curato 2017, 144), many of those with whom I spoke were disillusioned. The economic benefits that purportedly accrued under Aquino seemed to them only to be felt by a few, leaving behind marginalized communities that included Filipino migrant workers. Through Duterte, many Filipinos in the diaspora felt that at long last, somebody was setting the nation on the correct path. Stories of Duterte’s reign as mayor of Davao were shared with reverence. That Duterte also made gestures toward catering to progressive causes, including his decision to offer cabinet-­level positions to progressive politicians (Bello 2017) and his condemnation of “anti–­Overseas Filipino Worker” (OFW) policies such as Philippine customs agents’ tendency to vigilantly search the luggage of returning overseas workers to search for taxable goods (Ranada 2016), seemed to show that despite his blustering persona, his politics were commendable. In addition, Duterte’s unwillingness to kowtow to U.S. imperialist policies appealed to progressive members of the diaspora (Bello 2017). Consequently, pro-­Duterte groups mushroomed across Canada, as they did in countries where there were numerous OFWs. The explicit goal was to get not just OFWs but also their families back home to support Duterte. Interestingly, within months of his election, some of the same members of the Filipino diaspora who supported him started to doubt his sincerity. There were hushed reports of extrajudicial killings, of children being the collateral damage in his “war against drugs,” of police forces acting without restraint. Then there was the jailing of political opponents, the eventual ousting of progressive cabinet members like former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary Judy Taguiwalo, and the unceasing attacks against journalists. More recently, Duterte’s statements that he was “powerless to protect OFWs” and his belief that rape and sexual violence were unfortunate yet unavoidable realities that female OFWs had to face (Aguilar 2019) caused widespread anger among the Filipino OFWs whom I knew in Canada, including former supporters. Codex 15 Still, there were those in the diaspora who doubted the veracity of the reports. The discourse of “fake news” became prominent transnationally through Duterte’s and U.S. president Donald Trump’s use of the term. Both disavowed news reports that challenged their respective actions. This meant that there was widespread confusion about what was true and what was not. Hence many Filipinos abroad were unsure of who and what to believe. The way Duterte supporters quickly mobilized against anyone who dared voice concerns about Duterte, with vitriolic and oftentimes gendered threats made frequently, lent a chilling atmosphere to political discourse online. And yet even members of the Filipino diaspora who did not know what. © 2020, Studies in Global Asias. All Rights Reserved.",
10.37016/mr-2020-026,do the right thing: tone may not affect correction of misinformation on social media,"An experiment conducted with 610 participants suggests that corrections to misinformation – pointing out information that is wrong or misleading and offering credible information in its place – on social media reduce misperceptions regardless of the correction’s tone (uncivil, affirmational, or neutral). There is also an opportunity to correct secondary but related misperceptions (dealing with the same topic but with a different specific fact) when responding to misinformation on social media. Our findings emphasize that correction on social media could operate as part of a broader strategy to reduce beliefs in misinformation, and users should be encouraged to bring additional relevant information into the conversation, using whatever tone feels most comfortable for them. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

10.1037/emo0000590,creating emotional false recollections: perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency mechanisms,"We investigated the impact of 2 hypothetical mechanisms of episodic memory reconstruction-perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency-on objectively measured recollection accuracy and false recollections of neutral and emotional stimuli. Participants encoded negative, neutral, and positive pictures depicting objects and scenes (i.e., target pictures), each accompanied with a descriptive verbal label (e.g., ""boy crying at funeral, "" ""wooden basket on floor, "" ""four chimpanzees laughing together""). Next, they encoded fragmented pictures of some of the scenes they did and did not earlier see (perceptual misinformation), or they received multiple presentations of the corresponding verbal labels (conceptual misinformation). Recollection of target pictures was then tested, using labels as retrieval cues. We had three key findings in each of two experiments. First, as in our prior work, both perceptual and conceptual misinformation significantly increased false recollection judgments of nonstudied pictures, including high-confidence errors. These effects implicate perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency mechanisms. Second, these misinformation effects generalized across all emotional categories, implicating separable roles of these two mechanisms on emotional recollections. Finally, conceptual misinformation was less likely to influence negative than neutral recollection errors, providing new evidence that emotion can improve retrieval monitoring accuracy and reduce false memories based on conceptual fluency (i.e., an emotional distinctiveness heuristic). © 2020 American Psychological Association.",

Today, as we look to journalism to protect us against misinformation and authoritarianism, the press is in a structural crisis. Journalism’s institutional support is collapsing, leaving entire regions and issues uncovered at a time when we desperately need reliable information and robust reporting. The crisis is disproportionately harming specific groups and regions, especially communities of color, rural areas, and lower socio-economic neighborhoods.

Our fears may prompt blame and its rationalization, but our fears may also motivate inquiry and learning. Compassion and collaboration hang in the balance—shaped in part, we shall argue, by political leadership, scientific expertise, and emergent social solidarity. Blaming others may side-step responsibility, but it will not encourage or target actions in response to suffering. But admitting ignorance and the need to learn, supporting widespread testing, and following best available public health advice might cultivate broader public action and confidence—as evidenced both in exemplary public leadership and in shared actions of mutual aid like social distancing. We argue that public leadership can model and encourage—or discourage!—compassionate and collaborative action, and we examine a striking natural experiment: the parallel COVID-19 briefings of the public by President Trump’s White House Task Force and New York State’s Governor Andrew Cuomo.

10.1037/xap0000265,the synchronization of collective beliefs: from dyadic interactions to network convergence,"Systems of beliefs organized around religion, politics, and health constitute the building blocks of human communities. One central feature of these collectively held beliefs is their dynamic nature. Here, we study the dynamics of belief endorsement in lab-created 12-member networks using a 2-phase communication model. Individuals first evaluate the believability of a set of beliefs, after which, in Phase 1, some networks listen to a public speaker mentioning a subset of the previously evaluated beliefs while other networks complete a distracter task. In Phase 2, all participants engage in conversations within their network to discuss the initially evaluated beliefs. Believability is then measured both post conversation and after one week. We find that the public speaker impacts the community's beliefs by altering their mnemonic accessibility. This influence is long-lasting and amplified by subsequent conversations, resulting in community-wide belief synchronization. These findings point to optimal sociocognitive strategies for combating misinformation in social networks. © 2020 American Psychological Association.",
10.37016/mr-2020-033,exposure to social engagement metrics increases vulnerability to misinformation,"News feeds in virtually all social media platforms include engagement metrics, such as the number of times each post is liked and shared.

This finding has important implications for the design of social media interactions in the post-truth age. To reduce the spread of misinformation, we call for technology platforms to rethink the display of social engagement metrics. Further research is needed to investigate how engagement metrics can be presented without amplifying the spread of low-credibility information. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School. All rights reserved.",
10.1073/pnas.2008595117,protecting memory from misinformation: warnings modulate cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval,"Exposure to even subtle forms of misleading information can significantly alter memory for past events. Memory distortion due to misinformation has been linked to faulty reconstructive processes during memory retrieval and the reactivation of brain regions involved in the initial encoding of misleading details (cortical reinstatement). The current study investigated whether warning participants about the threat of misinformation can modulate cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval and reduce misinformation errors. Participants watched a silent video depicting a crime (original event) and were given an initial test of memory for the crime details. Then, participants listened to an auditory narrative describing the crime in which some original details were altered (misinformation). Importantly, participants who received a warning about the reliability of the auditory narrative either before or after exposure to misinformation demonstrated less susceptibility to misinformation on a final test of memory compared to unwarned participants. Warned and unwarned participants also demonstrated striking differences in neural activity during the final memory test. Compared to participants who did not receive a warning, participants who received a warning (regardless of its timing) demonstrated increased activity in visual regions associated with the original source of information as well as decreased activity in auditory regions associated with the misleading source of information. Stronger visual reactivation was associated with reduced susceptibility to misinformation, whereas stronger auditory reactivation was associated with increased susceptibility to misinformation. Together, these results suggest that a simple warning can modulate reconstructive processes during memory retrieval and reduce memory errors due to misinformation. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats—or of most available policy solutions. Here we assess whether the popular press plays a role in spreading misinformation and misunderstanding about these issues via the agenda-setting, priming, and cultivation roles of the media, with the goal of better understanding the causes and consequences of public confusion. © 2020 The Authors; Environmental Policy; Nature Conservation © 2020 The Authors",

Theoretically, the article is framed through one of the important roles of journalism in a democracy: that journalists make an enormous contribution to the public by shining the spotlight on those with power. In addition, journalists are meant to serve the public by being reliable conduits of information. Yet if newsrooms are depleted of staff, especially of senior journalists, how can these functions be fulfilled? The methods of research here include a survey and interviews with journalists and unionists. This shows the traumatic transitions from full-time jobs in newsrooms to freelance or “gig” work to public relations or just being “broke” and unemployed. It also shows how journalists could hardly fulfil their roles to deepen democracy given the precarity of their job situations. © 2020 iMasa.",

With the spread of social media, the Internet has become much more user-oriented. In contrast to traditional media, social media's lack of control mechanisms makes the accuracy of spreading news questionable. This brings us to the significance of fact-checking platforms. This study investigates the antecedents of spreading false news in Turkey. The purpose of the study is to determine the features of fake news. For this purpose, teyit.org, the biggest fact-checking platform in Turkey, has been chosen for analysis. The current study shows fake news to be detectable based on four features: Propagation, User Type, Social Media Type, and Formatting. According to the logistic regression analysis, the study's model obtained 86.7% accuracy. The study demonstrates that Facebook increases the likelihood of news being fake compared to Twitter or Instagram. Emoji usage is also statistically significant in terms of increasing the probability of fake news. Unexpectedly, the impact of photos or videos was found statistically insignificant. © 2021 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",
10.15503/jecs2020.1.30.41,education as a means of affirming democracy values in john dewey’s pragmatism: modern perspective,"Aim. The aim of the research is to analyse the capabilities of Dewey’s pragmatism in the philosophy of education as a medium for affirming today’s values of democracy. Methods. The article is based on a conceptually extended literature review. Such philosophical methods as hermeneutics (to take into account the socio-cultural context in the process of investigating the content of primary sources), interpretation (to study the basic theoretical foundations of the educational process and to explain their practical value) and comparative analysis (to identify similarities or differences between different ideas and conceptions) are applied. Results. The research identified the philosophical dimension of education, making it possible to understand the nature of learning in pragmatism. An investigation is pursued into what role the activity of the subject plays in the learning process, how the importance of freedom is substantiated in communication, and what place in the face of contemporary civilisational challenges has experience as a medium of true knowledge for becoming the ideals of a democratic society. Conclusion. The methodology of pragmatism makes it possible to resolve contradictions in education. The theoretical and practical principles of pragmatism that were substantiated by John Dewey contribute to the formation of an active life position of students, the free and constructive communication between all participants in learning, and the promotion of the ideals of a democratic society. They create an environment for the formation of genuine experience and the development of critical thinking skills as reliable means of protecting against misinformation or the spread of false values and the precondition for the advancement of humanistic values. © 2020, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

Second, it identifies four strategies through which information quality may be advanced: controlling campaign finance; confronting misinformation; creating and disseminating quality information; and promoting quality discussion. Third, it examines existing knowledge on the most promising of these strategies, offering preliminary conclusions and pointers for further research. The article suggests that the optimal strategy has not yet been found, and that further research could help to develop it. © 2019 McDougall Trust, London.",

It is also a topic that has emerged at the precise time that museums are undergoing great transition, moving away from an authoritarian framework toward a democratic one that seeks to integrate diverse audiences and multiple perspectives. Climate change has manifest at a moment when the legitimacy and authority of science is being publicly questioned and debated. In the post-truth era of “fake news” and disposable facts, with the public increasingly suspicious and distrustful of media and government to provide reliable and accurate information, museums are positioned to assume an essential role in public education on climate change. Drawing upon research conducted at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science on visitors’ understanding and expectations on climate change messaging, this paper explores the critical role research and evaluation assume in the emerging discourse on climate change in science museums. © 2020, © 2020 Museum Education Roundtable.",
10.1080/15228959.2020.1737626,nonpartisan election information,"2020 is an election year in the United States. As we know from both past elections and the current election season, mudslinging, hyperbole, misinformation campaigns, and fake news proliferate the media landscape. Finding and recognizing reliable, accurate, nonpartisan election information can be challenging. Fortunately, several websites offer reliable, accurate, nonpartisan, and balanced information on the election and about voting. Some sources include information on how to register to vote, who can register to vote, and explain voting rights. Other sources provide links to or compile information on candidate voting records, where candidates get their funding, where they stand on issues, and fact check their statements. And, still others allow voters to get personalized information about what will be on their specific ballots, such as all the candidates running for local, state, and national offices, as well as bond measures, propositions, and other ballot initiatives. The reviews included in this issue’s column comprise a sampling of reliable election websites spanning the various election topics mentioned above. Librarians can feel confident recommending these sites to their patrons looking for accurate, balanced, reliable election and voting information. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

10.1177/0886260517692337,advocates’ experiences with media and the impact of media on human trafficking advocacy,"The present qualitative study explores advocates’ opinions of misinformation about human trafficking in the media and describes advocates’ strategies to counter the misinformation presented by the media. Thus, 15 advocates who work against human trafficking in Chicago-based nonprofit organizations participated in semistructured interviews about their opinions and strategies. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. The present study identifies specific misperceptions of human trafficking in the media, highlights advocates’ opinions of this misinformation, and discusses advocates’ strategies to counteract inaccurate media, adding support to the role of media advocacy. Advocates note how media images shape and perpetuate stereotypes of trafficking through glamorizing sex work and sensationalizing stories that are most often international depictions of trafficking. Advocates report media generally shares only a piece of the story, simplifying the stories of survivors and the issue of human trafficking. Advocates critique media perpetuating these misperceptions for how they may contribute to policies and programs which fail to address structural factors that create vulnerabilities to be trafficked and the multisystem needs of survivors. However, advocates also note misperceptions can be counteracted by producing sensitive, informed media through social platforms. Advocates share their strategies counteracting misinformation through engaging in informative conversations, utilizing social media to educate, and promoting media messages of survivor agency. Research, clinical, and policy implications are also discussed. The present study emphasizes the importance of decision makers and service providers being critical consumers of media and to assess how media portrayals may (or may not) inform their understanding and response to the issue. © The Author(s) 2017.",
NA,"fakes, forgery, and facebook: an examination of visual literacy in the era of manipulated images, fake news, and alternative facts","With concern over fake news, foreign meddling in national elections, and with the ubiquity of online photo sharing, this chapter outlines a methodological approach of studying visual literacy in online contexts. This approach is important in an era where 350 million new photos are added to Facebook every day, containing visual narratives, including those contained in manipulated images. Using quali-tative content analysis, this study investigated whether Facebook users' comments contain manifest statements of one's ability to critically read manipulated images. The results of this study found comments related to the photograph fell into six categories of discourse: (1) elitism, (2) humor, (3) unconditional support, (4) civil-ity and truth, (5) concern, and (6) miscellaneous rants. Evidence of the user ability to critically view the photograph and express their understanding of its falseness was found across all categories but especially in the humor, concern, civility and truth, and elitism categories. Regardless of the intent of the group responsible for posting the image on Facebook, we found evidence that the image was re- appropriated by both pro- and anti-Trump Facebook users as an evidentiary ex-hibit reinforcing their beliefs, though the beliefs the image serves to reinforce are vastly different between the two groups. © 2020, Sheree Josephson, James D.

10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.19,communication’s rough navigations: ‘fake’ news in a time of a global crisis,"The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 has created an environment of diverse challenges facing humanity, including ‘Stay at Home’ global strategies, isolation, social distancing, school and border closures, and widespread travel bans. The risk of this biological threat, its multiple unknown health aspects, social and economic impacts, and the inability of humanity to control it at present makes it difficult to predict how this situation will evolve. Unfortunately, such a global crisis gives rise to the manipulation of people by opportunistic groups through the falsification of information and news reporting. Loosely moderated social media platforms have largely contributed to an explosion of news referred to as ‘fake’. Global occurrences like the current COVID-19 pandemic reinforce the importance of developing critical thinking skills in undergraduate students as a fact-finding strategy to address the rising popularity of misinformation and disinformation found on social media sites. Consequently, this paper aims to highlight the importance of building a capacity to recognise fake news while seeking out reliable and valid information sources. Strategies to address fake news by international and local organisations will be explored using examples from Greece and Australia, as both of these countries demonstrated strong government leadership in the swift containment of the virus. Greece was quick to impose lockdowns that were respected and dutifully exercised by the Greek people. Similarly, Australia also imposed strict lockdowns strategies in the initial stages of their first reported COVID-19 cases and were also dutifully enacted by Australian citizens. Greece and Australia have been proactive in addressing disinformation and misinformation through comprehensive data analytics and fact-checking strategies, which are reported on through official platforms. Specifically, the authors aim to: a) Discuss the severe and even fatal problems that misinformation can cause, especially in the case of a global pandemic, like COVID-19, b) provide an audit and access to reliable sites, c) provide an outline of simple strategies that all individuals (including undergraduate students) can implement to source valid and reliable information surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. © Kaplan Singapore.

10.1080/13504622.2020.1737647,"personal, professional, political: an exploration of science teacher identity development for teaching climate change","Climate change presents societal and environmental challenges, as well as educational ones. Obstacles abound within teaching and learning climate change, related to its complex nature, the proliferation of misinformation, and its absence from many science curricula. Efforts have previously been made to study teacher content knowledge and beliefs on climate change with varying results. This study employed identity as a theoretical framework to examine aspects of climate change teaching. This study followed a reflexively iterative process that enabled the construction of a conceptual model for identity development. This model demonstrates multifaceted influences including personal, professional, and political elements, and the dynamism these elements exhibit over time. This conceptual model is best described via five trends: Personal Valuation of Nature; Experiences in Science Teaching and Learning; Teacher Instructional Support and Agency; Epistemic Evidence-based Instruction; and Civic and Social Awareness via Socioscientific Literacy. The presence and strength of enactment of each trend led to the development of four possible constructions of identity: Passionate Environmentalist, Student Interest Engager, Content First Educator, and Civic and Epistemic Skills Promoter. Most frequently teachers exhibited combinations of identities and often created a unique amalgam of multiple dimensions of identities in action. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

We explored rural women's perceptions and beliefs regarding barriers to vasectomy use in the low resource setting of Pwani, Tanzania. The qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to obtain data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 married/cohabiting women with two or more children. Thematic analysis guided the data analysis, with qualitative data reporting informed by COREQ guidelines. Most participants were Muslim and had between two and six children. Most had completed primary-level education and were engaged in small-scale farming. We extracted three main themes with associated sub-themes:1) lack of education, which included men's education levels and inadequate knowledge and misinformation 2) religious beliefs, social pressure and stigma, which included community stigma and the belief that vasectomy was not good for men with multiple wives; and 3) promoting men's involvement in family planning which included educating men and the women's perceived role in promoting vasectomy. Participating women perceived vasectomy uptake to be affected by a lack of low knowledge (among men, women, and the community), misinformation, and various sociocultural barriers. Efforts to promote vasectomy and male involvement in reproductive health services should be directed to addressing deeply-rooted sociocultural barriers. Women may have an essential role in encouraging their partners' vasectomy uptake. In addition, engaging couples in family planning education is critical to enhance knowledge. Ideally, such community based education should be conducted in partnership with communities and healthcare providers. Copyright: © 2020 Pallangyo et al.

While professional journalism standards have been used for long, both within and outside the industry, to assess the accuracy of news content and adjudicate on media conduct, the platforms are now resolving to different fact-checking routines to moderate and curate their content. The article will demonstrate how fact-checking organisations have different working methods than news operators and ultimately understand and assess ‘accuracy’ in different ways. As a result, this new and enhanced role for platforms and fact-checkers as curators of content impacts on how content is distributed to the audience and, thus, on media freedom. Depending on how the fact-checking standards and working routines will consolidate in the near future, however, this trend offers an actual opportunity to improve the quality of news and the right to receive information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.4324/9780429470509-7,commanding the trend: social media as information warfare,"“Commanding the trend” represents a relatively novel and increasingly dangerous means of persuasion within social media. A trending topic transcends networks and becomes the mechanism for the spread of information across social clusters. A trend can spread a message to a wide group outside of a person’s typical social network. Moreover, malicious actors can use trends to spread a message using multiple forms of media on multiple platforms, with the ultimate goal of garnering coverage in the mainstream media. Command of the trend enables the contemporary propaganda model, to create a “firehose of information” that permits the insertion of false narratives over time and at all times. The trend became so sensational that traditional media outlets chose to cover the Podesta email story, which gave credibility to the fake news and the associated online conspiracy theories promulgated by the Deplorable Network. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Christopher Whyte, A.

Specifically, “fake news” depicts the media as being intentionally deceptive, as opposed to merely incompetent. In this sense, a worldview that sees the news media as being deceptive provides more structure and predictability than one that views the news media as being sloppy or error prone. As a result, the belief that the news media is intentionally deceiving others may be especially appealing to individuals with a greater need for personal structure, and we review initial studies investigating this question. Such work may clarify an important contributor to rising distrust in the news media, and may in turn provide insight into why claims of fake news are effective and how belief in fake news can be reduced. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Rainer Greifeneder, Mariela E.

10.1080/07036337.2020.1853122,discursive continuity and change in the time of covid-19: the case of eu cybersecurity policy,"This article explores the extent to which Covid-19 has impacted the trajectory of EU Cybersecurity Policy. The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU’s response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s. © 2020 The Author(s).

Disinformation campaigns targeting health crisis communication during this pandemic seek to cripple the medical response to the novel coronavirus and instrumentalize the pandemic for political purposes. Propaganda from Russia and other factions is increasingly infiltrating public and social media in Ukraine. Still, scientific literature has only a limited amount of evidence of hybrid attacks and disinformation campaigns focusing on COVID-19 in Ukraine. We conducted a review to retrospectively examine reports of disinformation surrounding health crisis communication in Ukraine during the COVID-19 response. Based on the themes that emerged in the literature, our recommendations are twofold: 1) increase transparency with verified health crisis messaging and, 2) address the leadership gap in reliable regional information about COVID-19 resources and support in Ukraine. © 2020",
10.11645/14.1.2708,the amazing library race: developing students’ media and information literacy skills through games,"In this time of disinformation and misinformation, libraries remain a reliable source of truthful and factual information. As they fervently support the agenda of lifelong learning, libraries recognise that there are various influences that redefine the process of student learning. Admittedly, librarians need to be more creative in motivating post-millennial students to help them fully develop their Media and Information Literacy (MIL) skills. This paper explores how games are adopted and utilised by academic libraries as an interactive approach to entice students to learn essential MIL competencies. It shows how games can be a viable tool not only to deliver information literacy (IL) instruction in a collaborative learning environment but to also effectively engage and attract students to use the library resources and services. While the use of games is not novel, the way it is delivered and re-purposed to meet MIL competencies is vital for today’s young generation of learners. This report demonstrates how two academic libraries in the Philippines and Kazakhstan were able to embed MIL skills through a library race challenge. Furthermore, this paper discusses the practical steps undertaken in the preparation of the game as well as the observations made during and after the activity was conducted. From this, other libraries may gain insights and best practices on how to leverage this method to further champion MIL in their own communities. © 2020, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

From Welsh sheep using rounda-bouts to dolphins swimming in the Venice canals, the real from the fake becomes difficult to discern through technological advances but also in the belief in the underlying ideological environmental message it enables. In this article, I examine how these viral videos are not only being faked for the social validation of likes and retweets but have also become a tool for ecofascism: a far-right ideology that marries environmentalism with white supremacist ethnonationalism. I examine how social media is used to implicitly spread ecofascist ideas through an environmentalism fakery such as the urban Venetian dolphin that shows how humans, not COVID-19, are the virus and how these human-less vignettes are ultimately used by ecofascists to argue against immigration in order to ‘bring nature back to the natural order of things’. In conclusion, I look at what the initial implications are for communication and environmentalism and the potential these human-less lockdowns have for making convincing arguments for even the smallest of societal changes to mitigate climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).",

It considers the ways social media can be both an asset and a hindrance to the spread of true, verifiable information. The article delves into the many ways that social media is utilized by society, from situations in which it is used to spread useful information during public emergencies to the unfortunate reality of the spread of misinformation.

Despite economic downturn, one major impact of global pandemic is the rise of ‘infodemic’ and ‘disinfodemic’, which actually creates challenge for the public to access reliable information when they require it. News media plays a crucial role in such stressful situations by providing timely and accurate information about the pandemic. Nevertheless, when the news verification and gatekeeping is weak, dissemination of false information within the infodemic can result in the toxic disinfodemic of disinformation and misinformation. It is imperative to recognize that journalists, especially in restrained environments (like Pakistan), can combat infodemic and disinfodemic about the pandemic when their safety and accessibility to needed information are guaranteed, and when they are not prone to diverse challenges. Therefore, drawing on Reese’s hierarchy of influences model, this study seeks to explore the various levels of influences that impact on the Pakistani journalists’ reporting and their ability to deal with the challenges of infodemic and disinfodemic amid COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this study uses qualitative method of in-depth interviews (online) and employs thematic analysis to address the study’s findings. © 2020 Asian Media Information and Communication Centre.",

This research explored how social media facilitates information seeking, interpretation, and dissemination during extreme weather. Using Twitter data collected during a tornado-warned storm, this study explored the activity of different actor groups.

10.1002/acp.3577,deceiving suspects about their alibi is equally harmful to the innocent and guilty,"A common belief in police officers is that guilty suspects' statements are less consistent than innocent suspects'. This could leave guilty suspects more vulnerable to missing inconsistencies externally induced into their alibis. Source monitoring and cognitive load approaches suggest that untruthfulness rather than guilt should predict proneness to such deception. Manipulating both guilt and truthfulness, we tested these opposing hypotheses. One hundred twenty-six participants were accused of stealing gift vouchers after wandering about a building. When interviewed several days later, participants rarely detected alterations in their alibi (23–29%). Unexpectedly, for one of three detection measures, untruthful participants detected more manipulations than did truthful participants. Guilt did not moderate detection rates. Manipulations were equally harmful for guilty and innocent suspects, and blindness to the alibi manipulations was not useful for discriminating innocent from guilty suspects. Because blindness effects are easy to elicit in the legal context, techniques that externally induce inconsistencies should be avoided. © 2019 The Authors Applied Cognitive Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

Citizens are influenced by public figures, and some tend to believe that this is a myth. They are then far less inclined to adopt eco-friendly behaviors, consequently increasing their carbon footprint. The alarming issue of global warming is becoming irreparable with increase commute by car (Steg 2003). For the individuals to adopt “good” behaviors, it is not appropriate only to debilitate their beliefs but also to help them change their habits by a little help; that said, by a nudge. Previous research has shown the effectiveness of nudges on behaviors (Thaler and Sunstein 2008), this research proposes to use digital nudge as there is a growth in the relevance of nudging in the digital sphere as individuals are taking decisions on the influence of mobile applications or websites (Mirsch et al. 2017). This research examines two choice architectures. First, the feedback nudge – to put the targets in a favorable context so that they incline towards the right decision; it will also assist in knowing the adoption of public transport and more generally modes of public transport. Second, the planning prompts nudge to push them to act (i.e., go beyond the intention of change). The presentation of the social proof in the form of the story without contradicting the worldview of the recipient, the fake news could be debunked. These messages will be broadcasted on a mobile application, allowing personalized content delivered at a convenient time chosen. Other features of the messages like the social norm, will also be studied. A qualitative study and then experiments will make it possible to highlight the effects of a variety of characteristics of digital nudges on the debunking of beliefs, the intention of behavior, and actual behavior. The mediating role of processing fluency will be shown as well as the moderating role of online social support and credibility of the source. We point out three main contributions. First, this research addresses the question of the mechanism of a digital nudge. Second, we signify the combination of social influence and feedback nudge choice architecture for behavior change and debunking. The presentation of the social proof in the form of the story without contradicting the worldview of the recipient, the fake news can be debunked.

While such approaches see the problem of misinformation in terms of a contest between truth and falsehood, history suggests that people believe falsehoods, because they need to for a variety of psychological or socio-cultural reasons. While understanding what “needs” falsehoods meet may not provide an immediate solution to the problem of misinformation, it does open a different perspective on the question. In the end, the essay suggests that the current trend towards STEM education, to the growing exclusion of the humanities, may be slowly undermining the very analytical skills the public needs to be able to counter the tides of misinformation. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

Here we present newly identified manipulation techniques designed to maximize the value, longevity, and spread of harmful and non-factual content across social media using provenance information from web archives and social media analytics. After identifying conspiracy content that has been archived by human actors with the Wayback Machine, we report on user patterns of “screensampling,” where images of archived misinformation are spread via social platforms. We argue that archived web resources from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and subsequent screenshots contribute to the COVID-19 “misinfodemic” in platforms. Understanding these manipulation tactics that use sources from web archives reveals something vexing about information practices during pandemics—the desire to access reliable information even after it has been moderated and fact-checked, for some individuals, will give health misinformation and conspiracy theories more traction because it has been labeled as specious content by platforms. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

The contradictory views of the pro- and anti-GMO camps expressed in media debates, as well as deliberate anti-GM actions driven by nongovernmental organizations, have contributed to general misinformation and confusion as regards GM foods. Taken altogether this has resulted in political decisions taken on the regulations concerning GM foods, which vary significantly in different geographical regions. A number of factors can shape consumer’s attitudes toward GM foods, including level of understanding of science, religious and ethical beliefs, cultural aspects as well as openness to novelty. Therefore, consumer’s attitudes toward GM foods, their safety and potential risks may significantly diverge across different human populations. In this chapter, a comprehensive review of the public perception of GM foods in the last two decades in various European, North and South American and Asian countries is presented. The factors that potentially influence the observed differences in consumer’s attitudes are also discussed. As highlighted, there is an urgent need to implement evidence-based educational programs or continue to support the existing ones to raise public awareness of the current possibilities and limitations of GM foods. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

10.1371/journal.pone.0221319,unexpected sawtooth artifact in beat-to-beat pulse transit time measured from patient monitor data,"Object It is increasingly popular to collect as much data as possible in the hospital setting from clinical monitors for research purposes. However, in this setup the data calibration issue is often not discussed and, rather, implicitly assumed, while the clinical monitors might not be designed for the data analysis purpose. We hypothesize that this calibration issue for a secondary analysis may become an important source of artifacts in patient monitor data. We test an off-the-shelf integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device for its ability to yield a reliable pulse transit time (PTT) signal. Approach This is a retrospective clinical study using two databases: one containing 35 subjects who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, another containing 22 subjects who underwent spontaneous breathing test in the intensive care unit. All data sets include recordings of PPG and ECG using a commonly deployed patient monitor. We calculated the PTT signal offline. Main results We report a novel constant oscillatory pattern in the PTT signal and identify this pattern as a sawtooth artifact. We apply an approach based on the de-shape method to visualize, quantify and validate this sawtooth artifact. Significance The PPG and ECG signals not designed for the PTT evaluation may contain unwanted artifacts. The PTT signal should be calibrated before analysis to avoid erroneous interpretation of its physiological meaning. © 2019 Lin et al.

The evidence reviewed here explains that conspiratorial arguments and related misinformation appear plausible and unfalsifiable because people have high needs of knowledge, ego defense, and social integration. All in all, however, the effects of chronic motives are only moderate in size and fail to explain the social influence processes underlying conspiracy theories and fake news.

10.1038/s41558-019-0563-0,the accuracy of german citizens’ confidence in their climate change knowledge,"Accurate confidence—confidence that reflects the accuracy of knowledge—can be relevant for decision-making in areas of high uncertainty. Accuracy of confidence is of particular importance in the area of climate change where scientifically correct information exists alongside misinformation in the public discourse and media. Here we assess the accuracy of confidence in climate change knowledge in a national German sample (n = 509). The accuracy of the confidence of the citizens in their climate change knowledge was only around half of what it could be based on the accuracy of their knowledge. Moreover, the accuracy of confidence controlling for knowledge accuracy was lower for climate change than for two benchmark comparisons: general science knowledge in another national German sample (n = 588), and climate change knowledge in a scientist sample (n = 207). Although these results cannot necessarily be generalized to the population of all indicators of climate change knowledge, the results suggest that the confidence of citizens in their climate change knowledge is unnecessarily fuzzy given their actual knowledge. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",
10.1007/978-3-030-39165-2_190,"fake news and the top high-tech brands: a delphi study of familiarity, vulnerability and effectiveness: an abstract","Fake news is one of the most discussed phenomena in politics, social life and the world of business. Recent literature has indicated that it can be a serious threat to brands and their management. Brands can be both victims of, and either unwitting or deliberate agents of fake news. This paper presents the results of a three-round Delphi study of a panel of brand marketing scholars in which they indicated their familiarity with ten major high-tech brands, and estimated the vulnerability of these to fake news, and how effectively these brands would deal with fake news. The levels of familiarity with the brands vary considerably, and it also appears that lower familiarity with the brand (with one notable exception) is associated with higher estimates of vulnerability, and lower estimates of the management’s ability to deal effectively with fake news. The researchers considered a large number of commercial media brand ratings with titles such as, “World’s Best Hi-tech Brands”, “100 Most Valuable Brands”, “25 Best Technology Brands” and the like. Not surprisingly all these lists are marked by their differences rather than their similarities. A handful of brands such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft feature in all these rankings, but behind them, there tend to be differences. For purposes of this study, the researchers then settled on and included the following ten high-tech brands: Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, eBay, Facebook and Dell. The fake news phenomenon is unlikely to dissipate in the future, especially as social media technologies continue to make its spread so much easier. The risk to brands will be ever-present and will almost certainly increase. Hi-tech brand custodians do and will need to be vigilant of how they might be vulnerable and to have contingency plans in place for that day in the future when their brand becomes a target. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.",
10.21638/spbu22.2020.203,april fools’ day news — still funny?,"The long tradition of joking connected with the first day of April seems to be dying out in the era of fake news and scary headlines published every day. The aim of the article is to show the status of April Fools’ Day jokes in the Polish and English language context on the example of the material published on a single topic — swallowing inedible objects. In order to develop the methodology of analysis of humour in the news, it is useful to take into account the notion of incongruity, whether it is appropriate incongruity, background and foreground incongruities or various levels of meta-scripts. In order to discuss the collected material, it seems necessary to specify what kind of incongruities are involved as well as analyse the style of the stories in order to identify the intended message. The irrational behaviour of the stories’ protagonists seems to point the readers in the direction of a comic reading, but the stories are accompanied by pictures and even videos which aim at proving their credibility. The analysis of the selected examples points to the presence of incongruities, which are enhanced by colloquialisms as well as quasi-punch lines. Some news published on the first day of April look like jokes, but do not end with the traditional April Fool punch line, while some others are similarly strange, although they are published on different occasions. Thus it is not easy to differentiate serious from non-serious news. The appearance of daily news with incongruous content could also be seen in a broader context as one of the elements of the trend towards “weirdization” of public discourse. © 2020 Saint Petersburg State University",
10.4337/9781789900408.00013,sources and amplifiers of climate change denial,"Starting in 1989, corporations with strong ties to the production and use of fossil fuels, in coordination with allied trade associations, conservative think tanks, philanthropic foundations, and public relations firms, mounted campaigns opposed to action to mitigate carbon emissions. A crucial strategy of this climate change counter-movement (CCCM) was the implementation of well-organized efforts to undermine public understanding of human-caused climate change by promoting uncertainty over mainstream climate science. These long-term efforts, often led by front groups to hide corporate responsibility, enlisted contrarian scientists for credibility and public relations firms for expertise in messaging. The misinformation developed by the CCCM has been greatly amplified by conservative media (especially Fox News, WSJ and talk radio), bloggers, and social media - as well as the Republican Party in the US, which has institutionalized climate change denial.

10.1515/mopp-2018-0034,deliberating about climate change: the case for 'thinking and nudging',"Proponents of deliberative democracy believe deliberation provides the best chance of finding effective and legitimate climate policies. However, in many societies there is substantial evidence of biased cognition and polarisation about climate change. Further, many appear unable to distinguish reliable scientific information from false claims or misinformation. While deliberation significantly reduces polarisation about climate change, and can even increase the provision of reliable beliefs, these benefits are difficult to scale up, and are slow to affect whole societies. In response, I propose a combined strategy of 'thinking and nudging'. While deliberative theorists tend to view nudging askance, combining deliberation with nudges promises to be a timelier and more effective response to climate change than deliberation alone. I outline several proposals to improve societal deliberative capacity while reducing climate risks, including media reform, strategic communication and framing of debates, incentivising pro-climate behaviour change, and better education about science. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",
10.1016/j.learninstruc.2019.101215,judging scientific information: does source evaluation prevent the seductive effect of text easiness?,"Although nonexperts usually lack sufficient topic knowledge and experience, they can be “seduced” into relying on their direct evaluation of scientific content, particularly when encountering information that is relatively easy to comprehend. Two experimental studies tested whether this easiness effect can be prevented if readers can lean on evaluations of source credibility instead. In both studies, medical nonexperts read Internet texts about different health topics and evaluated the contained claims. The texts were either more comprehensible or less comprehensible, and they were supposedly authored by either a more credible or a less credible source. Experiment 1 demonstrated that nonexperts (i.e., 48 undergraduate students) agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from a more credible compared to a less credible source. However, the influence of source credibility did not prevent the easiness effect: Participants also agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from more comprehensible texts compared to less comprehensible texts. The same pattern of results emerged in Experiment 2 (with 53 undergraduate students), where source credibility was manipulated more strongly. Although source credibility had a greater effect on nonexperts’ claim judgment than in Experiment 1, readers still agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from more comprehensible than less comprehensible texts. Results of both studies suggest that nonexperts are not sufficiently aware of the relative importance of source evaluation, which may increase their susceptibility to misinformation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
10.3758/s13421-019-00948-y,science by social media: attitudes towards climate change are mediated by perceived social consensus,"Internet blogs have become an important platform for the discussion of many scientific issues, including climate change. Blogs, and in particular the comment sections of blogs, also play a major role in the dissemination of contrarian positions that question mainstream climate science. The effect of this content on people’s attitudes is not fully understood. In particular, it is unknown how the interaction between the content of blog posts and blog comments affects readers’ attitudes. We report an experiment that orthogonally varied those two variables using blog posts and comments that either did, or did not, support the scientific consensus on climate change. We find that beliefs are partially shaped by readers’ perception of how widely an opinion expressed in a blog post appears to be shared by other readers. The perceived social consensus among readers, in turn, is determined by whether blog comments endorse or reject the contents of a post. When comments reject the content, perceived reader consensus is lower than when comments endorse the content. The results underscore the importance of perceived social consensus on opinion formation. © 2019, The Author(s).",
NA,counteracting misleading protobacco youtube videos: the effects of text-based and narrative correction interventions and the role of identification,"YouTube's propagation of misleading protobacco content to youth has the potential to increase their protobacco beliefs, attitudes, and smoking behavior. We assessed the effects of potential interventions aimed at ameliorating the effect of misleading protobacco videos. An online experiment randomly exposed past and current young tobacco users (N = 716) between the ages of 15 and 19 years to real protobacco, pipe-focused YouTube content that was either shown in its original uncorrected form or edited to include either a propositional voiced and text-based rebuttal that warned about the health effects of smoking or a counternarrative that showed that a person who promoted protobacco messages was diagnosed with and eventually died from esophageal cancer. On average, the two interventions were equally effective at reducing the effects of protobacco messages on beliefs and attitudes. However, the narrative correction was more effective for participants who strongly identified with the character. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2020 (Yotam Ophir.

In the current study, we attempted to determine whether biology and environmental science students at a small college are able to transfer their critical thinking skills to the assessment of online information. Students were presented with examples of internet-based information sources and asked to rate their reliability. Regardless of major, class standing, or experience with primary literature, students accurately rated the internet sources. Students also provided written rationales for their ratings. Although freshmen and sophomores had unsophisticated rationales, juniors and seniors were likely to base their rationales on the presence or absence of evidence, peer review, and publication in a scientific journal.

10.17645/pag.v8i1.2560,populism and political knowledge: the united states in comparative perspective,"This article addresses the link between political knowledge and populist attitudes in the United States (US) in comparative perspective. At the beginning of the new decade, populism in the US is associated with support for the Republican party and Donald Trump in particular, and that is how I address it here. Using secondary data from a number of related studies, we find that, overall, support for Trump is not only negatively related to political knowledge, but also to other factors that make his supporters unaware of their being misinformed. This is because, more than for others, partisan cues serve them as a basis for their factual beliefs about political actors and events and assessments of the beliefs of others. While political knowledge has long been comparatively low in the US, as I show in the early part of the article, the relationship between misinformation and populism (i.e., support for Trump) is seen as a new and especially worrisome element. In the concluding section I address what, if anything, could be done to address this situation. © 2020 by the author.",
NA,“never let a good crisis go to waste”: strengthening eu actorness amid increased competition of external actors in the western balkans,"In this article, we argue that while examin-ing the Western Balkans’ integration process during the Covid-19 crisis we must take into consideration not only the EU’s influence but that of other powerful external actors as well. Based on the external incentives model, Russia, China and Turkey are thus analysed as competing external actors to the EU’s enlargement policy in the WB. We establish that during the Covid-19 crisis these actors have been increasingly competing with the EU especially with respect to the determinacy of conditions via state propaganda and by attacking the EU’s credibility with disinformation campaigns. Nevertheless, their influence in terms of the size of the rewards and domestic adoption costs has dropped in comparison to the EU as the latter has increased its rewards, strength-ened conditionality and regained some of its lost credibility capabilities. The most significant change visible during the Covid-19 crisis is a further fragmentation in addressing individual WB states by Russia, China and Turkey, whereas the EU remains the only external actor capable and willing to addresses the entire WB region. © 2020, Ljubljana University.

10.24917/20841043.10.1.7,a war in the head. the new model of russian propaganda as a hobbesian time of the disposition of war,"A major part of research into cyber-propaganda discusses the following components it uses: disinformation, creating fake news and employing so-called farm trolls. Actions of this kind do not correspond with the classic division of soft and hard power, since neither can their goals nor the means they utilise be unambiguously defined as coercion, payment, or attraction (Nye, 2009; Mazur. Bubak, 2020). In my article, I describe the hidden means of propaganda employed by the Russian Federation that are additionally supported by a process of armament which cannot be classified as an act of disinformation. These actions aim at achieving a specific type of psychological vantage which stems from an atmosphere of fear, lack of trust, and enmity created within European societies as a result of the incoming information about Russia's increasing military potential as well as new, dangerous means and resources that could be utilised in combat. Such an atmosphere is referred to as a ""war in the head"", and it pertains to the personal belief that a military conflict is imminent, expressed by individual citizens including those in key public offices. This phenomenon, while bringing to mind Hobbes' state of nature which encompasses the distinct readiness to fight, directly afflicts the internal and international security of European states. Such a situation directly afflicts the internal and international security of European states, for the state of fear and distrust leads to the dismantlement of public democratic institutions, and it does not help in the search for effective methods of solving either internal or global problems (Nussbaum, 2018). © 2020 by the Author(s).",

We contrast humor versus non-humor correction strategies that point out rhetorical flaws in misinformation regarding the HPV vaccine, which was selected for its relevance and impact on public health. We randomly assigned participants to one of two experimental conditions: humor correction versus non-humor correction. Our analyses revealed that the humor correction increased attention to the image portion of the correction tweet, and this attention indirectly lowered HPV misperceptions by reducing the credibility of the misinformation tweet. The study also found that the non-humor correction outperformed the humor correction in reducing misperceptions via its higher credibility ratings. Practical implications for correcting misinformation on social media are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.101316,cognitive complexity increases climate change belief,"The present research bridged the relationship between cognitive complexity and belief in anthropogenic climate change and tested the differential effectiveness of two argument types. In the first two studies (with 817 and 226 participants, respectively) we found that participants with lower levels of cognitive complexity were less likely to believe in anthropogenic climate change than those with higher levels. In Study 3 we used an experimental design with 304 participants to examine the reactions to different types of arguments across people with differing cognitive complexity. We compared the two most common types of arguments in discussions of climate change: 1) Presenting facts about climate change on their own (one-sided); 2) Presenting opposing arguments (i.e., misinformation) together with the correct climate change facts (two-sided). Participants with lower cognitive complexity were more likely to believe in climate change when exposed to facts of climate change on their own compared to the two-sided, refutational combination of misinformation and facts; but those with higher cognitive complexity were more likely to believe in climate change when exposed to the refutational combination rather than facts alone.

Past research indicates that not only do young adults rely heavily on information obtained from the web and social networks, but also that they may not be able to judge the authenticity, validity, and reliability of digital information, and may share misinformation among themselves. This can be particularly problematic in the context of health information. Two complementary research studies investigated young adults’ information needs and information seeking in support of their personal well-being, and in comparison to academic and other everyday-life information domains. Results show that young adults consider a range of factors as part of their well-being; these include physical and mental health, spirituality, social connections, and financial stability. They engage in information seeking (active and passive) in support of all of these factors. While they were able to identify information resources as more or less credible, they did not necessarily choose highly credible resources most frequently. Interestingly, they did not use social media sources frequently in the context of health information, choosing to deliberately maintain a degree of privacy with respect to health. While there is evidence of some information literacy skills, there remains a need for further and more extensive information literacy education. This should be addressed by librarians from academic, consumer health, public, and school libraries. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",

In addition, a memory of being represented by a woman in the past tends to inflate overestimates further.

We assessed content from the most active vaccine accounts on Twitter to understand how existing online communities contributed to the ‘infodemic’ during the early stages of the pandemic. While we expected vaccine opponents to share misleading information about COVID-19, we also found vaccine proponents were not immune to spreading less reliable claims. In both groups, the single largest topic of discussion consisted of narratives comparing COVID-19 to other diseases like seasonal influenza, often downplaying the severity of the novel coronavirus. When considering the scope of the ‘infodemic,’ researchers and health communicators must move beyond focusing on known bad actors and the most egregious types of misinformation to scrutinize the full spectrum of information--from both reliable and unreliable sources--that the public is likely to encounter online. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

10.11621/PIR.2020.0401,covid-19: belief in conspiracy theories and the need for quarantine,"Background. Situations that are characterized by unexpected scenarios, unpredictable developments, and risks to life and health facilitate beliefs in conspiracy theories. These beliefs — together with reliable information, intentional and unintentional misinformation and rumors — determine attitudes toward the situations and ways to overcome them. Objective. To examine the effect of belief in conspiracy theories on the recognition of the need for quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic; the effect of personality traits on belief in conspiracy theories and on the recognition of the need for quarantine; the relationship of belief in conspiracy theories with assessment of the dangers of COVID-19 and with feelings of hopelessness. Design. The study was conducted over a period when the number of coronavirus cases was growing, during the first three weeks of the lockdown in Russia. The sample included 667 undergraduate and graduate students aged 16-31 (M = 20.44, SD = 2.38); 74.2% of the participants were women. Respondents filled out two online questionnaires. The first related to perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic; the second was a brief HEXACO inventory. Results. Belief in Conspiracy Theories accounts for 13% of variance in Recognition of the Need for Quarantine; together with Dangers of COV-ID-19 and Hopelessness, conspiracy beliefs account for more than a quarter of the variance. Personality traits defined in the context of the 6-factor personality model have a small effect on conspiracy beliefs about the coronavirus and on perception of the need for quarantine. Conclusion. Belief in conspiracy theories is associated not only with irrational views of reality, but also with the adoption of ineffective behaviors. © 2020. Lomonosov Moscow State University.

10.1108/978-1-83982-400-520201034,journalistic professionalism in greece: between chronic and acute crises,"Crisis in journalism is a widely discussed and controversial topic in Greece since 2009 when economic recession afflicted the Greek society. However, the last decade of financial hardships and ownership changes in the Greek media sector (2009-2019) gave rise to a widening of perception on the part of journalists of what really crisis stands for when it comes to their profession. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with Greek leading news media professionals from all types of media outlets (press, television, radio and news websites), the present research describes how journalists perceive, assess and manage the crisis of their profession in today’s networked media landscape, characterised by unprecedented phenomena such as the rise of churnalism, post truth journalism and fake news in the context of new trends with regard to how the Greek audience is seeking information and consuming news. While existing research on journalism profession has tended to emphasise the conversion of journalist into a multitasked employee towards audience members who treat journalism with suspicion, this chapter focusses on to what extent journalists by themselves are critical of their profession’s vulnerabilities such as the lack of genuine investigative journalism, alienation from the actual reporting based on primary material and manipulation of media professionals within an unstable market. The research gives insights into journalists’ opinions and attitudes with regard to the symptoms indicating that journalism in Greece is suffering from chronic and acute crises related to the extraction and dissemination of news, the relationship of journalists with media owners as well as the operation of the media market. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.",
10.37016/mr-2020-48,the different forms of covid-19 misinformation and their consequences,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, an understanding of the structure and organization of beliefs in pandemic conspiracy theories and misinformation becomes increasingly critical for addressing the threat posed by these dubious ideas. In polling Americans about beliefs in 11 such ideas, we observed clear groupings of beliefs that correspond with different individual-level characteristics (e.g., support for Trump, distrust of scientists) and behavioral intentions (e.g., to take a vaccine, to engage in social activities). Moreover, we found that conspiracy theories enjoy more support, on average, than misinformation about dangerous health practices. Our findings suggest several paths for policymakers, communicators, and scientists to minimize the spread and impact of COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

Still, no experimental research examines how these ideas about mindfulness and mindfulness meditation influence responses to state mindfulness instruments designed to measure related outcomes. Methods: The current study implemented an experimental-experiential design to examine how the presentation of mindfulness via mindfulness theory-consistent(TC) and theory-inconsistent(TI) treatment rationales and subsequent mindfulness meditation practices (consistent with respective rationales) affected participants’ (n = 114) state mindfulness scores and perceptions of mindfulness. Self-reported trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS), state mindfulness (Toronto Mindfulness Scale, TMS; State Mindfulness Scale, SMS), and qualitative measurements (participant open entry) were utilized. Results: Despite vastly different presentations of mindfulness being utilized by participants (successful experimental manipulation; significant between-group differences in number of qualitative mindfulness misconceptions coded [TI > TC]), there were no significant differences between the two experimental groups on state mindfulness measures directly following TC and TI rationales and practices. No significant differences were observed between the TC and TI conditions for usability or perceived accuracy of the rationales and practices, and self-reported previous mindfulness experience did not predict one’s likelihood of providing qualitative misconceptions. Conclusions: When taught TI mindfulness meditation material, participants were more likely to respond with TI information even though state mindfulness measures after practice did not differ from the TC condition. Results and limitations are discussed, along with suggestions for future research directions and practice implications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

10.4337/9781789900408.00015,responding to climate science denial,"Although effectively responding to misinformation is notoriously difficult, research has identified best practices that can be employed. Drawing from literature in psychology, sociology, communication, and political science we identify and review four potential strategies to respond to climate denial. First, prebunking or inoculation may preemptively confer cognitive resistance and limit audience receptiveness to misinformation by teaching individuals how to identify and deconstruct flawed arguments, mitigating their persuasive appeal. Second, communicating the scientific consensus on climate change may provide a gateway to more accurate climate beliefs. Third, directly correcting misinformation can be effective, especially when using best practices that include simple rebuttals, replacement with correct facts, and reliance on expert sources. Fourth, technocognition solutions are particularly important online to facilitate identification and correction of misinformation as it emerges. Based on these strategies, we propose an agenda to help scientists, educators, and practitioners engage more effectively with climate change denial. © David C Holmes and Lucy M Richardson 2020.

10.1007/978-981-15-5876-4_5,building digital resilience ahead of elections and beyond,"Donara Barojan explores the impact of emerging soft threats, such as disinformation and digital manipulation, on election vulnerability. She argues that researchers, policymakers, and journalists reporting on elections tend to focusing solely on technological vulnerabilities, while overlooking individuals’ cognitive shortcomings and societal vulnerabilities. Barojan examines these vulnerabilities in great detail by describing the “toxic information environment” created when they interact, which in turn facilitates the spread of disinformation and fake news. Barojan also describes some of the tactics that the DFR Lab has observed while monitoring elections around the world “to make sure that disinformation and nefarious influence campaigns did not have an effect on the outcome of these elections or the post-electoral discourse”. Case studies from elections in Moldova, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States illustrate the use of doctored videos, commercial and political bots (automated social media), and sock puppet (inauthentic social media) accounts. Barojan then lists a number of approaches to counter online hostile actors, which include participating in open source and digital forensic training events, following the research published by the DFR Lab to “inform the public of the challenge of disinformation”, maintaining transparent communication with the public, and harnessing the “power of technology” to track disinformation campaigns and digital manipulation in multiple languages. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",
10.17645/mac.v8i2.3219,spreading (dis)trust: covid-19 misinformation and government intervention in italy,"The commentary focuses on the spread of Covid-19 misinformation in Italy, highlighting the dynamics that have impacted on its pandemic communication. Italy has recently been affected by a progressive erosion of trust in public institutions and a general state of information crisis regarding matters of health and science. In this context, the politicization of health issues and a growing use of social media to confront the Coronavirus “infodemic” have led the Italian Ministry of Health to play a strategic role in using its official Facebook page to mitigate the spread of misinformation and to offer updates to online publics. Despite this prompt intervention, which increased the visibility and reliability of public health communication, coordinated efforts involving different institutions, media and digital platform companies still seem necessary to reduce the impact of misinformation, as using a multichannel strategy helps avoid increasing social and technological disparities at a time of crisis. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",
10.1007/978-981-15-5876-4_3,tools of disinformation: how fake news gets to deceive,"In this chapter, Edson C. Tandoc Jr. Assesses why people believe in and propagate false information found online. He does so through four components of communication—namely Sender, Message, Channel and Receiver—and examines the different factors that affect each one. Tandoc’s research reveals that an increasing number of people get their news from social media instead of local news websites, which leads to various consequences on all four components of communication. He explains that individuals judge a news story’s credibility not only on who shared it on social media, but also on the number of likes, comments, and shares. Fake news producers therefore often “produce clickbait content to get more people to like, share, or comment on their fake stories, often playing into readers’ biases or interests”. Tandoc proposes that although the majority of disinformation research has focused on Facebook and Twitter, “fake news now increasingly moves through closed social media applications, such as the messaging app WhatsApp”. He also delineates how fake news and disinformation thrives in times of uncertainty and in situations of information overload—combatting this issue will require a “multi-pronged approach involving technological, economic, legal, and social interventions”. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",
10.1037/ppm0000229,how audience involvement and social norms foster vulnerability to celebrity-based dietary misinformation.,"Entertainment media often connect celebrities to potentially dangerous dietary advice that is explicitly at odds with medical opinions about achieving a healthy weight. Despite concern from federal officials about the amount of misleading dietary claims in popular media, many individuals believe and even take up this celebrity-based bad advice. A survey with manipulated stimuli (N = 466) builds upon social–cognitive theory and the appraisal theory of emotions to test a proposed conceptual model whereby audience involvement processes (i.e., identification, parasocial relationships, and liking) and social norm perceptions shape subsequent emotional and social–cognitive reactions, which in turn influence openness to celebrity-based nutrition misinformation. The results partially support the proposed model, indicating that pop culture media can influence audience vulnerability to diet-related misinformation. The findings presented here also offer guidance on ways to potentially mitigate celebrity-based misinformation by utilizing other relatable celebrities to deliver inspiring and accurate messages.

Technology has enabled more organisations to gain access to effective mass media to disseminate both accurate information and disinformation. As information sources have proliferated, information users are confronted by a plethora of superficially credible, contradictory ‘facts’ and opinions. A curriculum redesign project at an Australian university provided an opportunity to embed information discernment into a first-year unit, and to strengthen students’ capacity to engage critically with contradictory sources and competing worldviews. The review found that: (1) it was necessary to explain the importance of information discernment, (2) a restriction of information sources was helpful to the initial development of discernment, (3) the purposes of (university) education required explicit discussion, (4) it was useful to discuss the relationship between research and personal experience, and (5) later modules must consolidate and extend information literacy learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1177/1052562919826613,the menace of misinformation: faculty misstatements in management education and their consequences,"In this essay, we explore the misinformation that management professors give to students in the classroom. Although faculty do not intend to deceive students with this misinformation, nevertheless, it can have damaging consequences, including undermining students’ well-being and limiting their aspirations. We discuss two general types of misleading statements: misinformation about the economic model (e.g., that money and material possessions lead to happiness) and misinformation about what matters in life (e.g., that career success is the most important component in the fabric of life). Most of this misinformation is deeply rooted in our materialistic culture and economic system, and a belief in profit maximization as a predominant goal. Last, we discuss ways in which faculty can escape from providing this misinformation and help students find fulfilling paths in life. © The Author(s) 2019.",
10.28945/4407,the impact on public trust of image manipulation in science,"Aim/Purpose In this paper, we address the theoretical challenges today's scientific community faces to precisely draw lines between true and false pictures. In particular, we focus on problems related to the hidden wonders of science and the shiny images produced for scientific papers or to appeal to wider audiences. Background As rumors (hoaxes) and false news (fake news) explode across society and the current network, several initiatives using current technology have been launched to study this phenomena and limit the social impact. Over the last two decades, inappropriate scientific behavior has raised more questions about whether some scientific images are valid. Methodology This work is not about analyzing whether today's images are objective. Instead, we advocate for a general approach that makes it easier to truly believe in all kinds of knowledge, scientific or otherwise (Goldman, 1967; Goldman, & Olson, 2009). This need to believe is closely related to social order (Shapin, 1994). Contribution We conclude that we must ultimately move away from older ideas about truth and objectivity in research to broadly approach how science and knowledge are represented and move forward with this theoretical approach when communicating science to the public. Findings Contemporary visual culture suggests that our world is expressed through images, which are all around us. Therefore, we need to promote the reliability of scientific pictures, which visually represent knowledge, to add meaning in a world of complex high-tech science (Allamel-Raffin, 2011; Greenberg, 2004; Rosenberger, 2009). Since the time of Galileo, and today more than ever, scientific activity should be understood as knowledge produced to reveal, and therefore inform us of, (Wise, 2006) all that remains unexplained in our world, as well as everything beyond our senses. Recommendations for Practitioners In journalism, published scientific images must be properly explained. Journalists should tell people the truth, not fake objectivity. Recommendations for Researchers Today we must understand that scientific knowledge is mapped, simulated, and accessed through interfaces, and is uncertain. The scientific community needs to approach and explain how knowledge is represented, while paying attention to detail. Impact on Society It is sometimes hard to build data that represents scientific truth. More so, data could also be designed to intentionally fake knowledge. This leads to huge consequences when it comes to how the public understands science. Future Research In today's expanding world, scientific research takes a more visual approach. It is important for both the scientific community and the public to understand how the technologies used to visually represent knowledge can account for why, for example, we know more about electrons than we did a century ago (Arabatzis, 1996), or why we are beginning to carefully understand the complexities and ethical problems related to images used to promote knowledge through the media (see, i.e., López-Cantos, 2017). © 2019, Informing Science: the International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline.",
NA,effects of dress and speech style on credibility of co-witness and misinformation acceptance,"Many variables can potentially impact eyewitness testimony. In this study, we looked at effects of dress and speech style of a co-witness had on the credibility of that witness and the amount of misinformation that was accepted from the witness. The co-witness was a confederate that provided 5 pieces of misinformation in his video recorded testimony. Each participant viewed a video of the co-witness wearing either a dress shirt and tie or a plain sweatshirt, while talking either powerlessly (includes pauses, hesitations, and filler words) or powerfully (does not include pauses, hesitations, and filler words). The results indicated that the participants accepted more of the misinformation when the co-witness was dressed professionally rather than when he was dressed casually. The results also showed that the overall credibility, confidence, trustworthiness, and knowledgeability of the co-witness were rated significantly higher in the powerful group than in the powerless group. A significant interaction between dress and speech style for overall credibility was found such that in the casual dress condition, the powerful speech condition produced higher credibility ratings than did the powerless speech condition, but in the professional dress condition speech style did not affect credibility. A significant interaction between dress and speech style on knowledgeability showed the same pattern. Our results were consistent with previous research and helped support the attribution and implicit personality theories. © NAJP.",

In this situation, there is a temptation to see public service media, and the BBC in particular, as beacons of light in an otherwise gloomy picture. This article attempts to provide a note of caution to those who see the public service model as the most effective means of holding power to account and as the most desirable alternative to the flawed news cultures of both commercial and authoritarian landscapes.

The factual basis of (political) information may be challenged by opposed partisans or issue publics, and misinformation may impact decision-making as confirmation biases may outweigh accuracy motivations. In this setting, fact-checkers that refute the false claims of misinformation may be regarded as an important tool to combat misinformation. Yet, the effectiveness of corrective information may be contingent upon partisan lenses, or the framing used in misinformation. In this study, the effectiveness of fact-checkers that refute different forms of misinformation on the polarizing issue of crime rates related to anti-immigration framing was assessed in the US and Netherlands. The main findings indicate that exposure to fact-checkers can correct misperceptions on immigration, and lowers the credibility of misinformation. Fact-checkers are more effective in the Netherlands than the US. These findings have important ramifications for understanding citizens' susceptibility to (partisan) misinformation and rebuttals. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language. All Rights Reserved.",

In this part I will discuss the social feature of ignorance, arguing that it is not solely a property of individuals, but it can be shared and rethought in a social dimension. In particular, I will argue that ignorance, like knowledge, is situated in the eco-cognitive environment of the epistemic agents and it can also be distributed among them by exploiting the functionality of context-based information-sharing mechanisms. Thus, by understanding how information and knowledge are distributed in specialized environments, we should be able to get a picture of how ignorance is equally shared in the same contexts. Therefore, to study ignorance distribution in epistemically rich contexts, I will employ cognitive niche theories, which deal with how knowledge and information are actively and passively shared among group of people. Finally, without bringing about some differentiations of forms of ignorance, I will describe some ways it can be socially distributed, as misinformation, covering beliefs, and taboos. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

The article argues that faculty communicate misinformation about the economic model and what matters in life. This rejoinder addresses the notion that social class plays a significant role in what students value and what matters to them in life. Social class refers to the division of individuals or groups of culture based on wealth, income, education, type of occupation, and social network. Social class matters because it shapes individuals’ experience of themselves in the world. I argue that socioeconomic factors matter when you discuss beliefs, values, and norms. Student demographics are changing in higher education. Working-class students are gaining access to higher education, which means that the classrooms in business schools are becoming more diverse. Ultimately, social class plays a role in how students view life and how they treat other people. The article concludes with a call to faculty to understand and explore differences in our classroom. © The Author(s) 2019.",

Building on the framework of how audiences act to authenticate information, this study provides a user perspective on which strategies people use in evaluating information in OSN. In 15 qualitative interviews, participants were asked to think aloud while evaluating whether the content of posts from their own newsfeeds and of interviewer-supplied posts was true or false. Their answers were analyzed to determine which evaluation strategies they used. Analyzing participants' thoughts as they evaluate information is more reliable than directly asking participants which strategies they think they use. Results show that users' strategies in information evaluation are searching for more information, knowledge of account or content carries the most weight, and every detail needs to fit. A comparison of strategy usage for posts from befriended versus unknown personal accounts as well as for posts from followed news outlets versus not followed news outlets shows that for posts from followed news outlets, knowledge of the account was the most-used strategy followed by knowledge of the content. For other types of posts, strategy usage varied more widely and depended on each post. This highlights the importance and possible higher ecological validity of research on posts from news outlets that users actually follow, as users' experiences with previous posts seem to play a major role in how they go about evaluating information in new posts. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language.

The misinformation often leads to decreased memory accuracy and incorporation of the misinformation into the original event memory. The present study sought to determine whether high-NFC individuals would be more likely to detect discrepancies between the original event and the misinformation, making them less susceptible to the influence of misinformation. This was hypothesised because high-NFC individuals should be more likely to engage in effortful processing that could be used to carefully monitor the source of misinformation and detect discrepancies in order to avoid false memories. Further, when presented with misinformation, high-NFC individuals had more accurate memories and accepted less misinformation than low-NFC individuals. The results suggest that high-NFC individuals are less susceptible to misinformation suggesting they might be more likely to engage in discrepancy detection. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1007/s11229-017-1536-3,toward a formal analysis of deceptive signaling,"Deception has long been an important topic in philosophy (see Augustine in Treatises on various subjects, New York, Fathers of the Church, 1952; Kant in Practical philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996; Chisholm and Feehan in J Philos 74: 143–159, 1977; Mahon in Int J Appl Philos 21: 181–194, 2007; Carson in Lying and deception, Oxford University Press, New York, 2010). However, the traditional analysis of the concept, which requires that a deceiver intentionally cause her victim to have a false belief, rules out the possibility of much deception in the animal kingdom. Cognitively unsophisticated species, such as fireflies and butterflies, have simply evolved to mislead potential predators and/or prey. To capture such cases of “functional deception,” several researchers (e.g., Sober, From a biological point of view, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994; Hauser in: Whiten, Byrne (eds) Machiavellian intelligence II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 112–143, 1997; Searcy and Nowicki, The evolution of animal communication, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2005; Skyrms, Signals, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2010) have endorsed the broader view that deception only requires that a deceiver benefit from sending a misleading signal. Moreover, in order to facilitate game-theoretic study of deception in the context of Lewisian sender-receiver games, Brian Skyrms has proposed an influential formal analysis of this view. Such formal analyses have the potential to enhance our philosophical understanding of deception in humans as well as animals. However, as we argue in this paper, Skyrms’s analysis, as well as two recently proposed alternative analyses (viz., Godfrey-Smith in Review of signals: evolution, learning, and information by Brian Skyrms, Mind, 120: 1288–1297, 2001; McWhirter in Brit J Philos Sci 67: 757–780, 2016), are seriously flawed and can lead us to draw unwarranted conclusions about deception. © 2017, Springer Nature B.V.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0207383,"information-theoretic models of deception: modelling cooperation and diffusion in populations exposed to ""fake news""","The modelling of deceptions in game theory and decision theory has not been well studied, despite the increasing importance of this problem in social media, public discourse, and organisational management. This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in “fake news” attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to “fake news” attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis. © 2018 Kopp et al.

In the face of this, the popularity and relevance of fact-checking services have increased in recent years. Nevertheless, not much is known about the effectiveness of these journalistic entities. This study proposes a theoretical framework that systemizes possible influencing factors. An online survey of 607 German media users was conducted, measuring the effectiveness of several clarifications in adjusting recipients' misperceptions about six current controversial issues in Germany. The results indicate that journalistic clarifications are in fact capable of causing an adjustment process. Regression analyses show that, contrary to expectations, the users' attitudes that go against the message of the clarification had only a small effect on the adjustment process. Media reliance had positive effects on only one issue, as well, and cognitive mobilization on two issues. A positive evaluation of the quality of the clarification showed effects in four cases, but not always as expected. Evaluations of the credibility of the communicator delivered no effects. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language. All Rights Reserved.",
10.1007/s11229-017-1532-7,conspiracy theories on the basis of the evidence,"Conspiracy theories are often portrayed as unwarranted beliefs, typically supported by suspicious kinds of evidence. Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories is—at the very—least understandable (because conspiracies occur) and if we take an evidential approach—judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits—belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases. Drawing on this work, I examine the kinds of evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the evidential problems typically associated with conspiracy theories are not unique to such theories. As such, if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error? I argue that whatever we might think about conspiracy theories generally, there is no prima facie case for a scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use of evidence. © 2017, Springer Nature B.V.",

Journalistic fact-checking assesses the accuracy of individual public statements by public officials, but less is known about whether this process effectively imposes reputational costs on misinformation-prone politicians who repeatedly make false claims. This study therefore explores the effects of exposure to summaries of fact-check ratings, a new format that presents a more comprehensive assessment of politician statement accuracy over time. Across three survey experiments, we compared the effects of negative individual statement ratings and summary fact-checking data on favorability and perceived statement accuracy of two prominent elected officials. As predicted, summary fact-checking had a greater effect on politician perceptions than individual fact-checking. Notably, we did not observe the expected pattern of motivated reasoning: co-partisans were not consistently more resistant than supporters of the opposition party. Our findings suggest that summary fact-checking is particularly effective at holding politicians accountable for misstatements. © The Author(s) 2019.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.10.006,beyond fatalism: information overload as a mechanism to understand health disparities,"Background: Fatalism – beliefs about the causes and controllability of disease – has been negatively associated with prevention behaviors. Fatalism has been suggested as a mechanism for health disparities because ethnic minorities are especially likely to hold fatalistic beliefs. However, the construct has been criticized: Fatalism fails to account for structural barriers to health faced by vulnerable populations that also score highly on measures of fatalism. Another critique suggests that operationalizations of fatalism expose communication failures: “Fatalism” rather reflects information overload from an environment riddled with misinformation and contradictions. This study aimed to expand understanding of one mechanism through which communication may contribute to disparities by considering the context of nutrition among bicultural Latinas, who face increased risk from dietary acculturation. Method: Mixed-methods (semi-structured in-depth interview, survey) with Mexican-American women ages 18–29 (n = 24) in rural California. Results: Contrary to previous studies, the majority of this sample of Mexican-American women did not endorse fatalistic beliefs; most demonstrated clear understanding of the link between diet and risk of diseases: Diabetes and heart disease were understood to result from behaviors within one's control. Yet despite articulating links between diet and disease, participants felt overloaded and confused about conflicting information from public and interpersonal sources. Moreover, despite reporting feeling inundated with information, participants noted critical information gaps, distinguishing between information available and information needed. Conclusions: We found minimal support for fatalistic beliefs among a sample of Mexican-American women, but considerable information overload and confusion, together with a desire for specific knowledge and skills. Results extend understanding of how communication may influence disparities: Information overload may be conflated with fatalism, challenging the notion that fatalism is a cultural belief. Moreover, inequalities in access to and ability to process information compound overload effects. We discuss opportunities to improve the clarity of communication about nutrition science and dietary recommendations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

10.1016/j.cognition.2018.07.015,mnemonic accessibility affects statement believability: the effect of listening to others selectively practicing beliefs,"Belief endorsement is rarely a fully deliberative process. Oftentimes, one's beliefs are influenced by superficial characteristics of the belief evaluation experience. Here, we show that by manipulating the mnemonic accessibility of particular beliefs we can alter their believability. We use a well-established socio-cognitive paradigm (i.e., the social version of the selective practice paradigm) to increase the mnemonic accessibility of some beliefs and induce forgetting in others. We find that listening to a speaker selectively practicing beliefs results in changes in believability. Beliefs that are mentioned become mnemonically accessible and exhibit an increase in believability, while beliefs that are related to those mentioned exrience mnemonic suppression, which results in decreased believability. Importantly, the latter effect occurs regardless of whether the belief is scientifically accurate or inaccurate. Furthermore, beliefs that are endorsed with moderate-strength are particularly susceptible to mnemonically-induced believability changes. These findings, we argue, have the potential to guide interventions aimed at correcting misinformation in vulnerable communities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

This belief, popular in the late nineteenth century, maintained that cultivation of arid lands in the United States beyond the 100th meridian west would boost precipitation, creating a climate more favourable for farming. Encouraged by this narrative, homesteaders cultivated arid lands west of the meridian. Rain did not follow the plough and many farms in the Great Plains failed. RFTP was also invoked in South Australia in support of agricultural settlement north of Goyder's Line, a geographical boundary delineating the limits of reliable rainfall in the colony. This article revisits the origins of the doctrine and places RFTP messaging in its historical context by examining articles and poetry published in American and Australian settlement-era newspapers. The results of two newspaper database surveys reveal that a number of historical RFTP stories and an environmental poem with religious overtones appeared first in US newspapers and were later republished in newspapers throughout Australia. One of the surveys also reveals that, from 1876 to 1898, reports of parliamentary discussions or debates referencing the slogan were published in South Australia. The dissemination of inaccurate climate information in settlement-era America and Australia is discussed in relation to a proposed conceptual framework based upon contemporary theories of science communication that might provide a basis for the analysis of historical science messaging. © 2019 ANU Press.

10.1007/s12115-019-00357-6,"islamophobia, science and the advocacy concept","This article fully recognises the reality and detrimental impact of anti-Muslim sentiment and consequently that 'Islamophobia' describes an important social reality, especially in contexts where Muslims are a minority. However it is critical of ‘Islamophobia’ as a valid concept in the social science. In the sociology of Islam, it actually distorts research by concentrating on Muslims as invariably victims of social forces. This article is a modest proposal to reconsider differences between science and advocacy concepts, thereby recognising their different and distinctive roles in social movements and academic institutions. It is important that those undertaking any scholarly study of detrimental social behaviour motivated by hatred possess valid theoretical and empirical tools to counter false information or distorted views of minorities. To this extent, Islamophobia is a valuable advocacy concept in the public sphere and scholars should aim to keep it there. However, the article explores the history and deployment of Islamophobia as an advocacy concept and exposes its limitations as scientific description of social reality. There are two contrasted conclusions to this critique. The pessimistic view is that all human societies are constructed around social groups that have exclusionary boundaries. Although boundaries are always changing, the inclusion/exclusion dynamic never wholly disappears. Policy efforts enhance cosmopolitan virtues. The optimistic conclusion is that advocacy concepts and scientific practices, while not entirely compatible, are not systematically opposed. Advocacy may have greater effect when it is grounded in reliable facts and tested assumptions. Defending science and critical debate are important in a political climate of ‘fake news’ feeding off negative stereotypes, hate speech and incivility. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.07.005,refutations of equivocal claims: no evidence for an ironic effect of counterargument number,"This study investigated the refutation of equivocal claims using counterarguments. Common sense suggests that more counterarguments should be more effective at inducing belief change. However, some researchers have argued that in persuasive reasoning, using too many arguments might lead to counterproductive skepticism and reactance. Thus, there have been calls to actively curtail the number of counterarguments used in refutations to avoid risking an “overkill backfire effect”—an ironic strengthening of beliefs from too many counterarguments. In three experiments, we tested whether calls to limit the number of counterarguments are justified. We found that a larger number of counterarguments (between four and six) led to as much or more belief reduction compared to a smaller number of (two) counterarguments. This was not merely an effect arising from a simple numerosity heuristic, as counterarguments had to be relevant to affect beliefs: irrelevant counterarguments failed to reduce beliefs even though perceived as moderately persuasive. © 2018 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition",

Users themselves may have the potential to diminish the impact of misleading information. In an online experiment with a 3 x 3 between-subjects design (credibility evaluation in user comments: positive vs. negative vs. none) x (numerical credibility rating: positive vs. negative vs. none), we tested the influence of bandwagon cues on the impact of a false news post on Facebook (N = 240). Contrary to prevalent assumptions regarding heuristic information processing, numerical credibility ratings had no influence on participants' credibility appraisals and intended sharing behavior. However, negative user comments diminished the believability of false news. Moreover, participants' willingness to share the news post publicly and privately was indirectly reduced by the effect of negative user comments on perceived news credibility. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language.

10.1016/j.acalib.2018.09.020,the “collage effect” – against filter bubbles: interdisciplinary approaches to combating the pitfalls of information technology,"The rapid development of information technology has partially been reversed, and may become a tool for manipulation, which is incompatible with librarians' social mission. Making information available, connecting databases, and making them accessible result in people becoming more and more exposed. Customisation and effectively filtered information sources create filter bubbles. Although new systems of collaboration would be suitable for sharing reliable knowledge, they often lead to the spread of fake news. Despite worrying trends, we seek an encouraging future. Therefore, in this paper we analyse the relationship between information technology, market economy, and the librarian profession from the perspective of Hungarian LIS education, and emphasise the importance of active and creative information provision based on interdisciplinarity. Based on our experiences we believe that current and future readers can be reached through intriguing collages of credible information. The use of collages can compensate for the effects of filter bubbles, and librarians may become the masters of creating digital information collages. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",
10.1002/acp.3531,an experimental examination of the effects of alcohol consumption and exposure to misleading postevent information on remembering a hypothetical rape scenario,"We experimentally examined the effects of alcohol consumption and exposure to misleading postevent information on memory for a hypothetical interactive rape scenario. We used a 2 beverage (alcohol vs. tonic water) × 2 expectancy (told alcohol vs. told tonic) factorial design. Participants (N = 80) were randomly assigned to conditions. They consumed alcohol (mean blood alcohol content = 0.06%) or tonic water before engaging in the scenario. Alcohol expectancy was controlled by telling participants they were consuming alcohol or tonic water alone, irrespective of the actual beverage they were consuming. Approximately a week later, participants were exposed to a misleading postevent narrative and then recalled the scenario and took a recognition test. Participants who were told that they had consumed alcohol rather than tonic reported fewer correct details, but they were no more likely to report incorrect or misleading information. The confidence–accuracy relationship for control and misled items was similar across groups, and there was some evidence that metacognitive discrimination was better for participants who were told that they had consumed alcohol compared with those told they had tonic water. Implications for interviewing rape victims are discussed. © 2019 The Authors. Applied Cognitive Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

10.4324/9780429244469-14,towards a new literacy concept1,"This chapter argues the need for a new definition of literacy that fits the current practices of consuming and producing information among teenagers. While their informational diets come almost exclusively from social media – where real and fake news are disseminated with much greater speed and credibility – most adolescents admit to having serious trouble differentiating the relevance of content and identifying the reliability of a source. In this scenario, the absence of media education that enables a critical attitude and provides reflective skills may have a negative impact on their decisions. At a higher level, it may put the foundations of democracy at risk. Therefore, based on recent research, this chapter defends the urgency of promoting informational literacy as a priority for public policies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",

Many of these obligations are frequently violated, and this doesn’t look like changing any time soon. Scholars can divide consumer-focused questions, very roughly, into three stages. At the first stage, there are questions about what media to consume: which newspapers to read, which television programmes to watch, who to follow on social media. At the second stage, there are questions about how to respond to the media that one does consume in belief-formation-whether to trust it at its word, dismiss it as “fake news”, or something intermediate. And at the third stage, there are questions about how to act on the basis of the beliefs one has arrived at. This chapter focuses most directly on the first stage: people’s obligations as consumers in deciding what media to consume. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",
10.1017/9781108594196.013,darwin or design?: examining sayyid ahmad khan’s views on human evolution,"In an 1896 article in the Urdu journal Tahzib-ul Akhlaq, titled ‘Adna Halat se Aala Halat par Insaan ki Taraqqi’ (The Stages of Human Development from an Inferior to Superior State), Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-1898) wrote, ‘The monkeys that exist today, orangutans and apes, are quite similar to humans in many ways. Darwin claims that middle chains are missing or extinct, but even if we found them, they would only prove similarities among kinds.' Here, Sir Sayyid’s reference to the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was not to discredit or defend Darwin’s theory of evolution, but to support his own position on the topic, outlined in ‘Adna Halat’. In the article, Sir Sayyid argued that humans evolved overtime from a common animal ancestor and this process is guided by a divine creator. He also believed that this process was not antagonistic towards Islamic beliefs and the Qur’an. Overall, this position tied in with his general approach to the relationship between science and Islam, one where science was a part of Islam; the other part being the Qur’an. Although most of Sir Sayyid’s views on evolution have appeared in various articles he wrote over the course of his life, ‘Adna Halat’ presents a detailed summary of his perspective regarding the origin and development of living things, including humans, from a common animal ancestor. Today, the theory of evolution by natural selection is officially accepted by scientific establishments worldwide, including countries with a Muslim majority, but many people remain unconvinced or apprehensive about this theory. While the scientific community continues to discuss and debate issues in the field of evolutionary biology, such as the role of genetics in the evolutionary process, some individuals are attempting to disprove the evolutionary thought all together. Some of these individuals go back to Darwin and point out flaws in his theory of natural selection, like the lack of adequate understanding of inheritance, while others claim that life is too complicated to have developed by chance and to support various views of divine creation. Providing evidence against a scientific theory backed with empirical observation and evidence is one thing, but discrediting it based on misinformation may lead to greater issues in the public sphere, including how evolution is taught in schools. Currently, this issue is even more apparent. © Cambridge University Press 2019.",
10.1098/rsos.180593,does truth matter to voters? the effects of correcting political misinformation in an australian sample,"In the 'post-truth era', political fact-checking has become an issue of considerable significance. A recent study in the context of the 2016 US election found that fact-checks of statements by Donald Trump changed participants' beliefs about those statements-regardless of whether participants supported Trump-but not their feelings towards Trump or voting intentions. However, the study balanced corrections of inaccurate statements with an equal number of affirmations of accurate statements. Therefore, the null effect of fact-checks on participants' voting intentions and feelings may have arisen because of this artificially created balance. Moreover, Trump's statements were not contrasted with statements from an opposing politician, and Trump's perceived veracity was not measured. The present study (N = 370) examined the issue further, manipulating the ratio of corrections to affirmations, and using Australian politicians (and Australian participants) from both sides of the political spectrum. We hypothesized that fact-checks would correct beliefs and that fact-checks would affect voters' support (i.e. voting intentions, feelings and perceptions of veracity), but only when corrections outnumbered affirmations. Both hypotheses were supported, suggesting that a politician's veracity does sometimes matter to voters. The effects of fact-checking were similar on both sides of the political spectrum, suggesting little motivated reasoning in the processing of fact-checks. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.",
10.31620/JCCC.12.19/07,a critical education for 21st century: a study on youth and media literacy,"Youth being exuberant, coruscating, inventive and spirited is the most critical element of the population. Youth are the powerful agents of social change. The study adopts UN stated citizenry between the age of 15-34 years as a youth. Youth presently comprises a significant part of the Indian population. India is anticipated to have a 34.33% share of youth in the total population by 2020. Social media is capturing plenty of popularity, study divulges that the average person spends additional time each day on their smartphone and PCs than they do sleeping. The youth expends more than 27 hours a week on social media platforms. Social media enables them to communicate and stay in touch with their social peers 24 x 7. Youth is plugged with the internet and aware of the constant updates. Media literacy becomes imperative for the youth as they are the social agents, if social agents are not media literate then the development of the country will hamper. Mis informed youth can create confusion and will be misled. Media literacy is to educate and make aware to the youth about the different media sources, content and how to read the content. The focus of the study is to promote media literacy among Indian Youth. This study intends to make Indian youth an expository thinker of the media content so that they can develop critical thinking, become analytical choosers, and inculcate critical reading skills. The study tries to probe the sagacity of Medial literacy amid Indian Youth through online surveys. The study is done on social media users who devour the internet more than two hours per day. The sample consumes information mainly political followed by entrainment and then International and sports. The survey reveals that the Indian youth face disinformation on social media routinely and sometimes they can unearth fake news and sometimes take it as truth. They find it hard to identify reliable and unreliable sources. The findings reveal that the Indian youth is somewhat aware of the media literacy but feel that media literacy should be enforced powerfully among the Indian citizens. The youth believes that thinking critically should be the main motive of media literacy followed by understanding the authors goal, creating media responsibly and become a smart consumer. The study concludes that social media platforms along with the government bear a responsibility to make Indian youth acquainted with the media literacy campaigns. Media literacy among youth can be imposed by organizing training programs, workshops by colleges and other educational institutions, incorporate in school and college curriculum. © 2019 Amity University.",
10.1016/j.jarmac.2019.06.001,does retrieval enhance suggestibility because it increases perceived credibility of the postevent information?,"Despite the robust memory-enhancing benefits of retrieval practice, an initial test can sometimes exacerbate eyewitness’ susceptibility to subsequent misinformation—a phenomenon known as retrieval-enhanced suggestibility. One explanation for this finding is that after taking a memory test, participant witnesses are more likely to treat the subsequently presented misinformation narrative as being credible (the misinformation acceptance account; e.g., Chan, Manley, & Lang, 2017). Another explanation suggests that prior testing enhances participants’ ability to learn the post-event misinformation (the test-potentiated learning account; Chan et al., 2017). In two experiments, we provided a direct test of these alternative hypotheses and showed that testing did not make participants believe the content of the narrative to be more accurate, and the perceived accuracy of the narrative was not associated with the likelihood of misinformation recall. These results are inconsistent with the misinformation acceptance account. © 2019 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition",
10.1093/joc/jqz014,the potential for narrative correctives to combat misinformation,"Misinformation can influence personal and societal decisions in detrimental ways. Not only is misinformation challenging to correct, but even when individuals accept corrective information, misinformation can continue to influence attitudes: a phenomenon known as belief echoes, affective perseverance, or the continued influence effect. Two controlled experiments tested the efficacy of narrative-based correctives to reduce this affective residual in the context of misinformation about organic tobacco. Study 1 (N = 385) tested within-narrative corrective endings, embedded in four discrete emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear). Study 2 (N = 586) tested the utility of a narrative with a negative, emotional corrective ending (fear and anger). Results provide some evidence that narrative correctives, with or without emotional endings, can be effective at reducing misinformed beliefs and intentions, but narratives consisting of emotional corrective endings are better at correcting attitudes than a simple corrective. Implications for misinformation scholarship and corrective message design are discussed. © The Author 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Communication Association.

Undergraduates (N = 206) watched a video of a car crash, after which they recalled the video with or without simultaneously making eye movements. Next, participants received misinformation about the video. Finally, during the critical test, they were questioned about video details. The results showed that making eye movements did not increase endorsement of misinformation (i.e., false memory), nor did it reduce (correct) memory details or memory vividness and emotionality. Random variation in sampling or measurement, low reliability of the test instrument, and observer-expectancy effects may explain discrepancies between study effects. Only multiple direct replications by different (independent) laboratories with standardized instruments will allow for assessing whether the effect is robust and largely independent of random variation and moderators. © The Author(s) 2019.",

In Study 1 (N = 86), one researcher presented bar tenants with (misleading) questions regarding a preceding interaction with another researcher. One week later, participants' memory was tested again. Study 2 (N = 189) added a delayed-testing only condition. We hypothesized intoxication to impair memory and enhance suggestibility and explored whether time of testing affected the outcome on these variables. In Study 1, intoxication reduced completeness and increased suggestibility. In Study 2, intoxication reduced completeness and increased suggestibility in delayed-only and repeated testing, compared with immediate testing. Sober participants benefited from repeated testing in Study 2, but not Study 1. Findings lend support for consolidation and decay theory and suggest that immediate (intoxicated) testing is preferable over delayed-only testing. Findings provide little support for alcohol myopia theory. © 2019 The Authors Applied Cognitive Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

The principal aim of this study was to develop a framework to ensure efficient utilisation of social media in the healthcare sector, considering available channels, usage preferences, privacy, reliability, barriers, and various cultural and behavioural aspects. A survey conducted with 254 participants depicts that Facebook (55.10%), YouTube (46.90%), Wikipedia (38.60%), and Google Plus (30.30%) constitute the channels that are primarily used to increase healthcare awareness. However, lack of privacy and propagation of misinformation served as the barriers inhibiting the usage of such social media platforms.

10.1163/9789004397965_009,sociology of religion in contexts: institutional constraints and personal beliefs,"In this article I will reflect about how the sociologist of religion's context may influence the research, both as a process and a product. I have no aim to give a full systematic treatment of the topic. Rather, I will bring forward some remarks, partly inspired by personal experience. I think turning 70 and retiring, at least formally, brings me into a situation where a kind of retrospective narcissism may be legitimate. During the almost 50 years in which I have been engaged in sociology of religion, important - some would say paradigmatic - changes have taken place in the field of social science. The old and strict positivism has been criticized through and through for many years now. Very few sociologists today believe that they can approach an objective reality in an objective way. Although finding social patterns is still an important aim for sociologists, they rarely conceive of the world as completely governed by objective social laws, paralleling the laws of nature. They do not believe that they can uncover these absolute laws through the help of exact methods and sufficient funding. Today, looking for contextual constraints is an integral part of the social-scientific project, and most sociologists acknowledge that there is an unpredictable element both in agency and society, since human beings have intentions and are able to go in many directions, except in situations of extreme control. Furthermore, the confidence in social science has become more modest and realistic since August Comte, the French philosopher who coined the term sociology, first named his new science social physics almost 200 years ago. Positivism is sometimes presented as a caricature. The young Peter Berger, interested as always in theology, once wrote: ""In a world full of Nazis, one can be forgiven for being a Barthian"" (Berger, 1990/1967, p. 21). A more current version might be: ""In a world of fake news, one may be forgiven for being a Positivist"". We should not forget that Positivism emerged partly as a scientific antidote to Fascist ideologies of man in society. However, mainstream sociology today seems to find a way and at least muddle through between the old naïve positivism and a radical postmodernism, usually a bit closer to positivism than to postmodernism. My impression is that most sociologists today, including ociologists of religion, in their empirical research are some kinds of moderate constructionists or critical realists, although skipping the somewhat overformalized apparatus of critical realism in a narrow sense. In other words, most sociologists acknowledge that there is a reality out there, independent of their language and methodology, but also that this reality must be interpreted. Important for us here is that such interpretations are influenced by the researchers' background and horizon, hopefully also by empirical findings. But such findings must be made sense of, they must be interpreted. The background and horizon of the researcher consist of many elements, varying from paradigmatic frames in one's discipline, via institutional settings and funding possibilities, over to personal convictions, religious, political or others. My overview of such contexts here is highly incomplete, but I will touch upon a few examples. © 2019 Brill Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.",

Secular common knowledge, including science, is used to adjudicate neutrally in disputes across all faiths. Some politicized religious groups have now begun to question the possibility of neutral arbitration, by denying any common knowledge. Secularism instead seems to be a rival to their faith. The belief in viable knowledge fracture, however, relies on a mistaken philosophy of science which allows that any general result in science is only a matter of opinion because theory is ever empirically underdetermined. True, but it may not be experimentally underdetermined.

10.1353/isl.2016.0024,the mad muslim mob: de/mythologising shi'i iran in v. s. naipaul's 'islamic' travelogues,"The advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution made Iran and Islam dominant representational motifs in western media and literature. The preponderance of such representations revolved around the Iranian nation's identification as a Shi'i Muslim-majority polity. As such, the Revolution's trajectory and its landmark events - such as the 1979 hostage crisis -were often construed in light of this fact. Prominent among literary representations of post-revolutionary Iran in western literature are V. S. Naipaul's 'Islamic' travelogues, Among the Believers (1981) and Beyond Belief (1998). This paper critiques Naipaul's representations of Iran and Shi'i Islam in the two travel narratives, highlighting some of the most popular instances of myth and disinformation that the texts propagate. Thematic critique of the narratives is intended to shed light on the author's Orientalist approach and his engagement in ahistoncal histoncism, which - coupled with a conspicuous ignorance of Iran, Islam, and Shi'ism - has resulted in two of the most notorious literary tirades on Islam and the Muslim World. © 2016 The Islamic College.

10.1080/09658211.2015.1102287,cortisol response and psychological distress predict susceptibility to false memories for a trauma film,"For eyewitness testimony to be considered reliable, it is important to ensure memory remains accurate following the event. As many testimonies involve traumatic, as opposed to neutral, events, it is important to consider the role of distress in susceptibility to false memories. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cortisol response following a stressor would be associated with susceptibility to false memories. Psychological distress responses were also investigated, specifically, dissociation, intrusions, and avoidance. Participants were allocated to one of three conditions: those who viewed a neutral film (N = 35), those who viewed a real trauma film (N = 35), and a trauma “reappraisal” group where participants were told the film was not real (N = 35). All received misinformation about the film in the form of a narrative. Participants provided saliva samples (to assess cortisol) and completed distress and memory questionnaires. Cortisol response was a significant predictor of the misinformation effect. Dissociation and avoidance were related to confabulations. In conclusion, following a stressor an individual may differ with regard to their psychological response to the event, and also whether they experience a cortisol increase. This may affect whether they are more distressed later on, and also whether they remember the event accurately. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",

Because misinformation can lead to poor decisions about consequential matters and is persistent and difficult to correct, debunking it is an important scientific and public-policy goal. This meta-analysis (k = 52, N = 6,878) revealed large effects for presenting misinformation (ds = 2.41–3.08), debunking (ds = 1.14–1.33), and the persistence of misinformation in the face of debunking (ds = 0.75–1.06). Persistence was stronger and the debunking effect was weaker when audiences generated reasons in support of the initial misinformation. A detailed debunking message correlated positively with the debunking effect. Surprisingly, however, a detailed debunking message also correlated positively with the misinformation-persistence effect. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",

Refuting rumors with statements from unlikely sources can, under certain circumstances, increase the willingness of citizens to reject rumors regardless of their own political predilections. Such source credibility effects, while well known in the political persuasion literature, have not been applied to the study of rumor. Though source credibility appears to be an effective tool for debunking political rumors, risks remain. Drawing upon research from psychology on 'fluency' - the ease of information recall - this article argues that rumors acquire power through familiarity. Attempting to quash rumors through direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency.

In what some analysts have called the “war on science”, it is important for sociologists to reflect on how we produce claims to truth and identify new strategies for connecting our propositions with analytic techniques adept at withstanding attacks from the outside. In this chapter, I present a series of responses to the political system’s ostensible aversion to empirical claims of the social sciences by explicating a theoretical perspective capable of producing reliable and valid knowledge, as well as illuminating strategies for advancing empirical nuance and methodological precision. With analyses of modern mass media as a backdrop, I propose a return to the foundational work of Michel Foucault on the (re)configuration of processes of knowledge production and governmentality to explore ways in which sociologists may deduce new claims from an increasingly diverse and complex public sphere. I argue that sociologists have novel tools at their disposal to enable the production of systematic knowledge and to combat growing trepidation to “truth” claims currently proliferating governmental and media discourse. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one’s prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education. We found that political knowledge did not improve judgments of accuracy but that media literacy education did. © 2016, © 2016 AERA.",

10.1111/pops.12394,the nature and origins of misperceptions: understanding false and unsupported beliefs about politics,"Political misperceptions can distort public debate and undermine people's ability to form meaningful opinions. Why do people often hold these false or unsupported beliefs, and why is it sometimes so difficult to convince them otherwise? We argue that political misperceptions are typically rooted in directionally motivated reasoning, which limits the effectiveness of corrective information about controversial issues and political figures. We discuss factors known to affect the prevalence of directionally motivated reasoning and assess strategies for accurately measuring misperceptions in surveys. Finally, we address the normative implications of misperceptions for democracy and suggest important topics for future research. © 2017 International Society of Political Psychology",

10.1111/fare.12235,confronting myths about sexual assault: a feminist analysis of the false report literature,"Inaccurate beliefs that women commonly lie about sexual assault and target innocent men are pervasive in the United States, particularly on college and university campuses. Research consistently demonstrates that false reports of sexual assault account for less than 10% of reported cases and that individuals are unlikely to be wrongly accused of sexual assault. Thus, to pursue justice on campuses and beyond, family scholars must challenge misinformation about false reports in their teaching and scholarship to shift the narrative away from these prevalent and harmful rape myths. Doing so will allow for a more comprehensive and informed dialogue about how to address sexual assault on university campuses. This article offers a feminist analysis of the issue, clearly delineates the definition of a false report, critically reviews the false report literature, and presents suggestions for educational efforts by family professionals. © 2017 National Council on Family Relations",
10.1016/j.futures.2016.03.002,genetically modified organisms and the age of (un) reason? a critical examination of the rhetoric in the gmo public policy debates in ghana,"Using narrative policy analysis we examined the adversarial rhetoric of claims-makers in their bid to undermine alternative and conflicting accounts of GMOs as environmental and human health risk and to forestall any challenges to the scientific authority of the technological deterministic account of the GMO policy debates in Ghana. The study shows that the GMO discourse was built with the rhetorical frames of smallholder farmer vulnerability and entitlement used in the account it contradicts, thereby legitimating its own appeal for responsive remedies. Civil society claims attacked GMOs as discriminatory and as an environmental and human health risk. Government and scientists engaged in unsympathetic counter rhetorical strategies in hopes of debunking or neutralizing the claim made by civil society. In other words, Government and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory and posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of insincerity, claiming that scientists had some kind of “hidden agenda” behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from their patents on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs includes the underlying assumptions, the uncertainties and the probabilities associated with both best and worst case scenarios. This is a necessary condition to minimise misinformation on GMOs but may be insufficient to completely erase conspiracy theories from the minds of the public especially when scientists and government are perceived to be biased towards multinational corporations that are ostensibly preoccupied with making profits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",

10.1037/cns0000137,the effects of exposure to differing amounts of misinformation and source credibility perception on source monitoring and memory accuracy,"Although it is well known that exposure to misinformation after an event can alter memory, less known are the effects of being presented with different amounts of misinformation. The present study examined (a) how exposure to different amounts of misinformation affects memory, (b) how sensitively individuals monitor the accuracy of a (mis)information source, (c) whether perceived credibility of the misinformation source mediates the relations between misinformation exposure and memory accuracy, (d) whether perceived source credibility is associated with improved source monitoring, and (e) how exposure to different amounts of misinformation affects the ability to accurately assess one's own memory performance. Participants watched a mock crime video, were exposed to a misleading narrative about the video containing 20%, 50%, or 80% misinformation, completed a memory test, and rated the credibility of the misinformation source and their own memory performance. Receiving more misinformation decreased memory accuracy. Interestingly, receiving more misinformation also led subjects to become more skeptical of the credibility of the narrative, dampening the negative effect of misinformation on memory accuracy. In addition, individuals' perceptions of the source's credibility and source monitoring accuracy were negatively associated. Lastly, participants' performance estimates and confidence were well calibrated to their actual performance, except when they were misled, supporting the idea that misinformed responses are more difficult to monitor. Participants also tended to overestimate their accuracy, particularly when they performed poorly. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",

Unbalanced English–Spanish bilinguals (N = 81) listened to a lecture in English (L1) or Spanish (L2), read notes in L1 or L2, and completed a forced-choice recognition test in the lecture language. Unlike prior studies with proficient bilinguals, unbalanced English-dominant participants showed greater recognition memory accuracy for material presented in English only than did material presented in Spanish only. English misinformation had a greater impact on memory for the Spanish lecture than vice versa. Most importantly, the modified misinformation paradigm is an effective tool to investigate academic misinformation effects and could be used in bilingual and monolingual research.

10.1111/pops.12449,"fighting the past: perceptions of control, historical misperceptions, and corrective information in the israeli-palestinian conflict","What makes people deny wrongdoing that their group has inflicted on others? Prior research argues that refusing to acknowledge past misbehavior contributes to intergroup conflict, making historical misinformation important to understand and address. In particular, feeling a lack of control may make people more vulnerable to these misperceptions—a claim we test in a preregistered survey experiment examining beliefs about the Palestinian exodus during the creation of the state of Israel. Consistent with expectations, Jewish Israelis who were asked to recall an event in which they lacked control were more vulnerable to arguments (incorrectly) denying any Jewish responsibility for the exodus. By contrast, corrective information successfully reduced misperceptions regardless of feelings of control. However, corrections had no effect on attitudes toward the outgroup or support for the peace process, which suggests that historical misperceptions may be more of a symptom of intergroup conflict than a cause of its persistence. © 2017 International Society of Political Psychology",

HPV vaccination paired with adequate knowledge about HPV infection provides the best protection against cervical cancer. To identify the level of knowledge and the health beliefs towards HPV and the HPV vaccine among HPV-vaccinated female students in Malaysia. A nationwide cross-sectional survey among 14 years old female students who had received three doses of the HPV vaccine was conducted in 32 randomly selected schools from 13 states and 3 federal territories in Malaysia between February 2013 and April 2013. Among 2482 respondents, knowledge about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score was only 3.56 (SD ± 1.76), out of a possible score of 10. The majority of respondents were unaware that vaccinating boys with HPV can help protect girls against HPV infection (91.6%), HPV cannot be cured(81.6%) and that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (70.3%). Most of the respondents had the misconception that only females get HPV (95.1%), and that the HPV vaccine eliminates the need for Pap smear tests (68.3%). Most respondents (91.6%) believed that they would not get an HPV infection. Almost half of the respondents (42.9%) held the misconception that HPV infection could not lead to serious illness. Findings revealed poor knowledge about both HPV and the HPV vaccine, low perceived susceptibility to HPV infection and misinformation about HPV infection among HPV-vaccinated girls. Therefore, it is essential to increase the knowledge and awareness of health risks regarding HPV infection among teenaged girls who have received the HPV vaccine. © 2016 Wong et al.

The fact-finding practices form in their turn a subcategory of rational discourse, a wider category that also encompasses argumentation on non-empirical issues. Based on these categories, it is easy to see the relationship between on the one hand pseudoscience, and on the other hand fact resistance, disinformation, and fallacies of reasoning. The flaws in argumentation are similar, and the main difference is whether or not the subject matter falls within or without the realm of science. © 2018, Universitat de Valencia.

10.1007/978-3-658-19925-8_7,critical thinking in higher education: how to foster it using digital media,"Critical thinking (CT) is an integral part of education, notably in higher education. In times of misinformation, oversimplified answers to complex problems and populist agitators, critical thinking remains a vital skill, necessary to differentiate accurate information from manipulation. Although students should learn how to use digital media critically to not fall prey to false information, hasty actions or to the dominance of the smart devices, digital technologies can also be very supportive to foster critical thinking. Therefore, they must be imbedded discreetly in teaching and learning environments in a way that they become supportive for the different activities of the critical thinking process. In this paper, we would like to unroll some ideas indicating how this could be done in higher education contexts. Fostering critical thinking demands quite a lot from teachers and students. Students, for example, must conceptualize and exercise different thinking modes, jettison dear beliefs and create new and substantial ways of thinking and acting. Teachers however need to get a very clear idea of what critical thinking means in their field. They must be able to model critical thinking, its criteria or strategies. Furthermore, they need to know and apply different instructional strategies that are helpful to bring students into the different activities of critical thinking. To broaden the perspective on concepts, we will discuss different definitions and traditions of critical thinking and offer a synthesis. In the next step, we will examine process-models of critical thinking and introduce educational strategies and design-principles. A further chapter is dedicated to digital media and critical thinking. We will have a focus on why students should critically think about media. From there, we will go back to general strategies and design principles for fostering CT and show how digital media could be practically used in accordance with these principles. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2018.",

That the media actively shaped the beliefs of its audience, regarding EU immigration, and that it did so through the propagation of misinformation and in the biasing and concealment of accurate information is also, I argue, overwhelmingly plausible. As such, the media handling of information concerning EU immigration during pre-Brexit campaigning provides a compelling illustration of the systematic violation of epistemic rights. In this paper, I outline the nature of epistemic rights and epistemic rights violations and demonstrate the widespread perpetration of such violations in pre-Brexit media coverage.

10.1371/journal.pone.0173606,self-delivered misinformation - merging the choice blindness and misinformation effect paradigms,"Choice blindness is the failure to detect a discrepancy between a choice and its outcome. The misinformation effect occurs when the recollection of an event changes because new, misleading information about the event is received. The purpose of this study was to merge the choice blindness and misinformation effect paradigms, and thus examine whether choice blindness can be created for individuals' recollections of a witnessed event, and whether this will affect their later recollections of the event. Thus, as a way of delivering misinformation the participants ostensibly became their own source of the misleading information. The participants watched a short film and filled out a questionnaire about events shown in the film. Some of their answers were then manipulated using reattachable stickers, which allowed alteration of their original answers. The participants gave justifications for their manipulated choices, and later their recollection of the original event was tested through another questionnaire. Choice blindness was created for a majority of the participants. A majority of the choice blind participants later changed their reported recollection of the event in line with the manipulations, whereas only a small minority of the participants in the control condition changed their recollection. This study provides new information about the misinformation effect, suggesting that this effect also can occur when misinformation is given immediately following presentation of the original stimuli, and about choice blindness and its effects on the recollections of events. The results suggest that memory blindness can be created when people inadvertently supply themselves with misleading information about an event, causing a change in their recollection. © 2017 Stille et al.

10.1002/acp.3309,developmental reversals in report conformity: psycho-legal implications,"Young children, young adults, and older adults witnessed a scene in groups of four same-aged acquaintances. Unbeknownst to the group, a technology allowed the scene to appear differently to one member (minority) than to the others (majority), which obviated the need to rehearse confederates or to artificially provide misinformation for the report conformity effect. After viewing, participants had public recollections, and 3 days later, their cued memory and confidence (for adults) were tested privately. Majority members' reports influenced the minority members' but only for adults, not for children (17% conformity compared with 35% for adults), thus providing evidence of developmental reversals in memory reports of verbatim details. Answer changes between the sessions were dramatically higher for minority participants at all three ages (6.7 vs. 66.7% for children, 10 vs. 50% for younger adults, and 26.7 vs. 63.3% for older adults).

10.1017/XPS.2015.21,classified or coverup? the effect of redactions on conspiracy theory beliefs,"Conspiracy theories are prevalent among the public. Governments frequently release official documents attempting to explain events that inspire these beliefs. However, these documents are often heavily redacted, a practice that lay epistemic theory suggests might be interpreted as evidence for a conspiracy. To investigate this possibility, we tested the effect of redactions on beliefs in a well-known conspiracy theory. Results from two preregistered experiments indicate that conspiracy beliefs were higher when people were exposed to seemingly redacted documents compared to when they were exposed to unredacted documents that were otherwise identical. In addition, unredacted documents consistently lowered conspiracy beliefs relative to controls while redacted documents had reduced or null effects, suggesting that lay epistemic interpretations of the redactions undermined the effect of information in the documents. Our findings, which do not vary by conspiracy predispositions, suggest policymakers should be more transparent when releasing documents to refute misinformation. © The Experimental Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2016.",

In the present study, we compare three potentially effective strategies in vaccine promotion: one contrasting myths vs. facts, one employing fact and icon boxes, and one showing images of non-vaccinated sick children. Beliefs in the autism/vaccines link and in vaccines side effects, along with intention to vaccinate a future child, were evaluated both immediately after the correction intervention and after a 7-day delay to reveal possible backfire effects. Results show that existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate. The implications for research on vaccines misinformation and recommendations for progress are discussed. © 2017 Pluviano et al.

Carvin was chosen as the subject for study as he is perhaps the most prominent example of the practice of journalism based on emerging techniques of collaborative verification, transparency and co-creation. A textual analysis of 3188 tweets published by the journalist between 11 November 2014 and 21 January 2015 was conducted to investigate his techniques, particularly in terms of verification and crowdsourcing. The elements of journalism in Carvin’s discourse and practice are discussed following Kovach and Rosenstiel’s work on the essential principles for journalism practice. Findings suggest that a social media journalist can integrate both collaborative reporting and established journalistic values of accuracy, trust and verification, with the community acting as a distributed and networked newsroom. Results show the use of specific and effective techniques to overcome misinformation and serve as a trusted node in the network.

Climate change can be expected to catalyse the susceptibility to flooding through extreme weather events, sea level rise (SLR) and other climate related pressures. Further, population growth in coastal proximity can exacerbate vulnerabilities by degrading ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs that island communities tend to rely on for protection. The net effect: More and more people are congregating in a high-risk zone for floods and storms, but are less and less protected from them. Conventional adaptation wisdom suggests three responses: (1) plan a managed retreat (e.g., move inland); (2) accommodate the changes (e.g., build stilt houses); (3) resist the intrusion (e.g., build sea walls). On the Carteret Islands of Bougainville/Papua New Guinea (PNG), also known as the Tulun or Kilinailau Atoll, none of these adaptation measures have so far enabled the islanders to adapt in situ to mounting people and sea level pressures, resulting in both ad hoc and planned out-migration responses. Drawing on pilot research conducted on the Tulun and Nissan Atolls of Bougainville/PNG, this paper examines the linkages between climate change and human movement. It extends previous research by expressly inviting the grassroots perspectives of atoll communities of origin and mainland communities of destination in Tinputz and Buka. The research develops recommendations in areas of education, livelihood security, government planning and countering misinformation. Experiences and lessons gathered in this paper will be useful for both policy and practice serving the cause of climate change adaptation in Pacific island communities. Working towards a better understanding of climate change related vulnerabilities in coastal areas will also enable better adaptation responses. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",
NA,danse macabre spinning faster,"This second paper on the theme of Danse Macabre Spinning Faster examines global dynamics using a framework constructed from the two axes: Power and Vulnerability crossed with Eros and Thanatos. The resulting four cells matrix offers an opportunity to examine afresh the world's political and social processes, particularly over the last two years. The paper develops the matrix using current events, identifies prevailing societal themes and generates hypotheses about global dynamics. Themes include examining increases in splitting, migration and tribalism, loss of trust in parliamentary democracy and the growth of presidential power, the maternal and paternal political environments, free speech, virtual reality, fake news and political correctness and the more negative impact of the internet. Three hypotheses are offered to try and understand current events: a) pressure on national and other boundaries; b) escaping from not knowing; and c) escaping from honest conversations because of the impact of guilt and shame. A Three Arches Model of development is offered to explain contemporary daily reality in the context of past, present, and future. A number of predictions are made.

10.11645/11.1.2188,information literacy is a subversive activity: developing a research-based theory of information discernment,"The theory of information discernment discussed here is firmly based on models, research and scholarship of information literacy coupled with theory and research in information behaviour. This paper will explore original research conducted by Walton and Hepworth and how it has developed over the last 10 years – the pilot study was reported in the very first edition of this journal in 2007. It will show that it has led to the emergence of the concept of information discernment and how Foucault’s discourse analysis theory has been used to further critically analyse its application. This paper will show how the research has been applied in a range of contexts, from enabling students in their first year of A-level study in the UK to carry out better research for their extended project qualification (EPQ), to teaching information literacy to undergraduates in various disciplines. This research will then be synthesised to create a new theory of information discernment summarised as: the ways in which social, psychological, behavioural and information source factors influence peoples’ judgements about information. I argue that information discernment should be included in future notions of information literacy and, in particular, informs the ACRL (2016) key threshold concept that authority is constructed and contextual. Attendant psychological notions of worldview, misinformation, confirmation bias, motivated reasoning and epistemic beliefs will be explored to determine how these articulate and enrich this new theory. The paper explores how this theory can be applied in practice beyond the learning environment, and argues that, ultimately, information literacy is a subversive activity which challenges received notions of the construction, communication and exchange of information and knowledge. © 2017, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

10.1080/1461670X.2016.1196602,boundaries not drawn: mapping the institutional roots of the global fact-checking movement,"The last five years have seen a global surge in political fact-checking, reporting that specializes in debunking political misinformation. A growing occupational movement, originating in the United States but increasingly international in scope, has sought to legitimize fact-checking as unbiased journalism, to establish common standards and practices, and to secure reliable funding for this emerging genre. As a genuinely transnational professional movement which includes practitioners from multiple journalistic cultures as well as other fields, fact-checking offers a new site to consider whether and how professional journalism is meaningfully becoming globalized. This paper models a novel approach to mapping a diverse organizational landscape in terms of institutional ties to the fields of journalism, academia, and politics. Drawing on fieldwork from two international gatherings of fact-checkers, I array fact-checking outlets on a ternary graph and review their competing understandings of the mission, the target, and the practices of fact-checking. I highlight areas of convergence as well as divergence in this organizational milieu, focusing particular attention on boundaries not drawn—the willingness of professional journalists in this global movement to share jurisdictional authority with non-journalists. I conclude with suggestions for a comparative research agenda focused on this emergent area of practice. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
NA,the hole in the sheet and other myths about sexuality and judaism,"For more than two millennia, Jewish communities around the world have found themselves the focus of speculation, misinformation, fear, derision and, at times, envy regarding the sexual beliefs and practices of its members. Over the centuries, some of these perceptions have become powerful enough to reciprocally influence how Jews perceive themselves. This paper seeks to shed light on some of the better and lesser well-known myths which surround sexuality and Judaism. The initial concentration is on a representative view of sexuality, intimacy and related gender expectations as discussed in traditional Jewish sources such as the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash. We then examine a number of myths which have become part of the legends surrounding Jewish sexuality, and look at the origins, where available, of this ""common wisdom"" and provide source material supporting more accurate information. While this paper focuses on the stigma and preconceived notions regarding Jewish sexuality, our point has application whenever we as sexual health professionals are called upon to educate or practice in the value-laden realm of human intimacy. © Stephen Hunt 2010.

10.1002/acp.3291,the use of recollection rejection in the misinformation paradigm,"The purpose of this research was to determine the role of recollection rejection in the rejection of misinformation. In Experiment 1, we examined the use of recollection rejection to reject contradictory and additive misinformation. We measured recollection rejection by comparing misinformation acceptance rates, graphing confidence-accuracy data using phantom receiver operating characteristic curves, examining high confidence rejections of misinformation, and examining self-report responses. These measures converged on the finding that participants used recollection rejection to reject both types of misinformation but used recollection rejection more on contradictory misinformation. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the delay between the event and misinformation and between misinformation and test. The length of both of these delays affected misinformation acceptance. Participants were more likely to use recollection rejection to reject contradictory misinformation after a short delay before encountering misinformation. Overall these findings indicate that people can spontaneously induce recollection rejection to reject misinformation and prevent false memories. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

10.3758/s13421-016-0597-8,how social interactions affect emotional memory accuracy: evidence from collaborative retrieval and social contagion paradigms,"In daily life, emotional events are often discussed with others. The influence of these social interactions on the veracity of emotional memories has rarely been investigated. The authors (Choi, Kensinger, & Rajaram Memory and Cognition, 41, 403–415, 2013) previously demonstrated that when the categorical relatedness of information is controlled, emotional items are more accurately remembered than neutral items. The present study examined whether emotion would continue to improve the accuracy of memory when individuals discussed the emotional and neutral events with others. Two different paradigms involving social influences were used to investigate this question and compare evidence. In both paradigms, participants studied stimuli that were grouped into conceptual categories of positive (e.g., celebration), negative (e.g., funeral), or neutral (e.g., astronomy) valence. After a 48-hour delay, recognition memory was tested for studied items and categorically related lures. In the first paradigm, recognition accuracy was compared when memory was tested individually or in a collaborative triad. In the second paradigm, recognition accuracy was compared when a prior retrieval session had occurred individually or with a confederate who supplied categorically related lures. In both of these paradigms, emotional stimuli were remembered more accurately than were neutral stimuli, and this pattern was preserved when social interaction occurred. In fact, in the first paradigm, there was a trend for collaboration to increase the beneficial effect of emotion on memory accuracy, and in the second paradigm, emotional lures were significantly less susceptible to the “social contagion” effect. Together, these results demonstrate that emotional memories can be more accurate than nonemotional ones even when events are discussed with others (Experiment 1) and even when that discussion introduces misinformation (Experiment 2). © 2016, The Author(s).",
10.1037/cns0000148,"""false memory"" is a linguistic convenience","The term false memory describes outcomes to various procedures and techniques, such as coming to believe that suggested false events occurred, acceptance of postevent misinformation, and recognition of critical lures in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) procedure. The literature to date has indicated that these memory errors intercorrelate poorly, if at all. However, issues with sample size and measurement reliability may have affected prior estimates. This study examined links among these 3 techniques in a sizable sample (N = 360), with attention to the reliability of procedures and measures. Weak but statistically reliable correlations emerged between false-event suggestion and postevent misinformation, and between postevent misinformation and DRM intrusions; correlations between false-event suggestion and DRM were weak and inconsistent. These effects were influenced by largely independent underlying mechanisms. The term false memory lacks precision and requires qualification. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",
10.1111/jsr.12436,sleep deprivation increases formation of false memory,"Retrieving false information can have serious consequences. Sleep is important for memory, but voluntary sleep curtailment is becoming more rampant. Here, the misinformation paradigm was used to investigate false memory formation after 1 night of total sleep deprivation in healthy young adults (N = 58, mean age ± SD = 22.10 ± 1.60 years; 29 males), and 7 nights of partial sleep deprivation (5 h sleep opportunity) in these young adults and healthy adolescents (N = 54, mean age ± SD = 16.67 ± 1.03 years; 25 males). In both age groups, sleep-deprived individuals were more likely than well-rested persons to incorporate misleading post-event information into their responses during memory retrieval (P < 0.050). These findings reiterate the importance of adequate sleep in optimal cognitive functioning, reveal the vulnerability of adolescents' memory during sleep curtailment, and suggest the need to assess eyewitnesses' sleep history after encountering misleading information. © 2016 The Authors.

10.1002/acp.3183,the persistence of erroneous information in memory: the effect of valence on the acceptance of corrected information,"People often have difficulty changing previously held, but erroneous, beliefs. This finding is particularly worrisome in politics where misinformation is regularly distributed about political candidates. We examined whether initial inferences about a fictional political candidate could be corrected, and whether people's willingness to accept a correction was influenced by the valence of the information being corrected. Participants read a list of statements describing a politician running for re-election in which a negative, positive or neutral piece of information about the politician was later corrected. Results showed that receiving a correction reduced reliance on the original information for all types of information: positive, negative and neutral. Results also showed that participants tended to rely on negative information the most when answering inference questions, regardless of whether it was corrected or not. Results have implications for decision-making in politics and other applied areas. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Unfortunately, online communities often become vehicles for promotion of pernicious misinformation, in particular, that HIV virus is a myth (AIDS denialism). This study seeks to explore online users’ behavior and interactions within AIDS-denialist community to identify and estimate the number of those, who potentially are most susceptible to AIDS-denialist arguments—“the risk group” in terms of becoming AIDS denialists. Social network analysis was used for examining the most numerous AIDS-denialist community (over 15,000 members) in the most popular Russian SNS “VK.com.” In addition, content analysis was used for collecting data on attitudes toward AIDS-denialist arguments and participants’ self-disclosed HIV status. Two data sets were collected to analyze friendship ties and communication interactions among community members. We have identified the core of online community—cohesive and dedicated AIDS denialists, and the risk group: users who communicate with core members, and, thus, can be more susceptible to the AIDS-denialist propaganda and their health behaviors (e.g., refusing treatment). Analysis allowed to significantly reduce the target audience for possible intervention campaigns and simultaneously increase the accuracy of determining the risk group composition. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.",
10.15244/pjoes/77049,logistics of the electronic waste sampling procedure: the influence of granularity on determination of copper content in pcbs,"Analytical data on material waste are usually obtained through analysis of samples that represent an insignificant portion of the investigated material mass. Therefore, for the obtained measurement data to be a reliable source of information, and not only analytical disinformation, the collected samples must be representative of the investigated waste material. Waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) is considerably heterogeneous material with a high content of copper. The test sample designated for the chemical analysis must truly represent the WEEE from which it was collected. The aim of this study was to develop an acceptable sampling procedure to investigate the composition of heterogeneous printed circuit boards; where the influence of grain size on the precision of chemical analysis of printed circuit boards waste (PCBs) stemming from mobile phones (MPs) has been investigated. Based on the chemical analysis of copper content in the sample (the highest metal content in PCBs) with grain size (d≤200 μm), copper content was 15.5% and dispersion was 1.62, which showed the highest accuracy of chemical analysis. © 2018, HARD Publishing Company.

Participants viewed a robbery video and discussed the event with a co-witness who was scripted to provide accurate or misleading details and to exhibit either high or low memory confidence. In a demonstration of memory conformity in co-witness discussions, highly confident co-witnesses who provided misleading or correct details led participants to report more misleading or correct information in both collaborative and individual reports. Furthermore, participants exhibited a confidence conformity effect, in which participants' confidence in their own memories mimicked the confidence of their co-witnesses.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

NA,fake news or disinformation 2.0? some insights into romanians' digital behaviour,"This paper focuses on digital behaviour, self-assessment of vulnerabilities to digital disinformation, and patterns of trust as exposed by Romanian citizens. By corroborating the data of the first national public opinion survey on fake news and disinformation (implemented between February and March 2018) with the Special Eurobarometer no. 464 - Fake News and Disinformation Online - implemented in the same time frame (February 2018), we capture the perceptions and attitudes of Romanian citizens over the use of new media and news trustworthiness, and we also compare the Romanians' online behaviour with the average European's. As similar research reveals, digital disinformation affects resilience of citizens in Member States and in the European Union overall, it ""threatens the democratic political processes and values"" (European Commission, 2018: 12), the integrity of elections and political processes, and should therefore, be approached as a legitimate public concern.

NA,the role of the public library in rebuilding the truth; [o papel da biblioteca pública na reconstrução da verdade]; [el papel de la biblioteca pública en la reconstrucción de la verdad],"Since the early twentieth century, the public library has been much contested. Initially the major criticism was centered on how these libraries, which looked more like book storage, could collaborate for the development of industrial society and later post-industrial society. With the advent of the information society, new challenges have arisen, such as print-to-digital issues and the growing collection of readership. Since the last century, the belief was that its fundamental purpose was the validation of truth, however political, economic and ideological interests foster the crisis of truth. Recently the charge is on the development of misinformation, manipulation and fake news. This work aims, based on ethnographic methodology, review of literature and comparative studies, to demonstrate how this new public library model can be. © 2018, Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

10.1016/j.concog.2017.02.017,social influence and mental routes to the production of authentic false memories and inauthentic false memories,"Two studies assessed the extent to which people incorporated false facts provided by bogus others into their own recognition memory reports, and how these false memory reports were affected by: (a) truth of the information in others’ summaries supporting the false facts, (b) motivation to process stories and summaries, (c) source credibility, and (d) ease of remembering original facts. False memory report frequency increased when false facts in a summary were supported by true information and varied inversely with the ease with which original facts could be remembered. Results from a measure probing participants’ memory perceptions suggest that some false memories are authentic: People sometimes lack awareness of both the incorporation of false facts into their memory reports and where the false facts came from. However, many false memories are inauthentic: Despite reporting a false memory, people sometimes retain knowledge of the original stimulus and/or the origin of false facts. © 2017",
10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01496,"exposing an ""intangible"" cognitive skill among collegiate football players: ii. enhanced response impulse control","American football is played in a dynamic environment that places considerable demands on a player's ability to make fast, precise reactions while controlling premature, impulsive reactions to spatial misinformation. We investigated the hypothesis that collegiate football players are more proficient than their non-athlete counterparts at controlling impulsive motor actions. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I football players (n = 280) and non-athlete controls (n = 32) completed a variant of the Simon conflict task, which quantifies choice reaction speed and the proficiency of controlling spatially driven response impulses. Overall, the choice reaction times (RTs) and accuracy rates of football players and controls were equivalent. Similarly, football players and controls were equally susceptible to producing incorrect impulsive motor responses. However, the slowing of RT attributed to the activation and successful inhibition of these impulses (i.e., the Simon effect) was reduced significantly among football players compared to controls. Moreover, differences in impulse control varied by position among the players, with the reduction being greater for offensive than for defensive players. Among offensive players, running backs, wide receivers, and offensive linemen had greater impulse control than did controls, whereas among defensive players only linebackers had greater control. Notably, the Simon effect was reduced by 60% in running backs compared to controls. These results contribute to emerging evidence that elite football players possess more proficient executive control over their motor systems than their age counterparts and suggest that the speed of controlling impulsive motor reactions may represent an enhanced cognitive ""intangible"" among football players. © 2018 Bashore, Ally, van Wouwe, Neimat, van den Wildenberg and Wylie.",
10.4324/9781315142326,the origins of trump’s “alternative reality”: a brief history of the breitbart effect,"“Fake news,” “alternative facts,” and American conservatives’ hostility to the mainstream media have a long history, one that dates to the rejection of science by the Right at the end of the First World War in favor of its own, traditional beliefs. By focusing on the uses of historically non-mainstream media by the Right in their reaction against science-based professional journalism at the time, this essay assesses the lasting effects of that monumental fight for the control of American culture. In brief, the denial of science by Biblical fundamentalists and, more generally, by cultural conservatives a hundred years ago established a practice of belief-driven counter-factuality that prefigured Andrew Breitbart’s attacks on the straight press in the early 2000s, as well as setting the stage for the “alternative reality” claimed by the Trump regime. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",

Although both sides of the debate in the focal article make some strong arguments both for and against utilizing performance ratings in organizations, we believe there continue to be misunderstandings, mischaracterizations, and misinformation with respect to some of the measurement issues in PM. We offer the following commentary not to persuade readers to adopt one particular side over another but as a call to critically reconsider and reevaluate some of the assumptions underlying measurement issues in PM and to dispel some of the pervasive beliefs throughout the performance rating literature.",
10.1080/21689725.2017.1349618,the new voice of america: countering foreign propaganda and disinformation act,"Just before the 2016 Christmas holiday weekend, President Barack Obama quietly signed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. Deep within the act is a controversial provision called the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (CFPDA), which establishes a Global Engagement Center under the State Department and consolidates the power of several federal broadcasting entities under one authority. This center will coordinate efforts to counter foreign propaganda, mainly from Russia and China, that is aimed at undermining the United States’ national security interests. The consolidation of power creates some concerns regarding journalistic independence and credibility for media outlets such as the Voice of America. The new Trump administration’s perceived amicable relationship with Russia also generates uncertainty around the commitment to fight Russian disinformation and propaganda. This essay argues that the US does in fact need some kind of governmental entity devoted to the creation of counter-propaganda, and then concludes there are deficiencies and vulnerabilities with the CFPDA, especially a lack of adequate administrative oversight. Based on this conclusion, as well as on lessons gleaned from how other nations have dealt with Russian disinformation campaigns, the essay offers tentative recommendations as to what an effective governing structure would look like. © 2017 National Communication Association.",
10.1017/S0007123415000253,a war of (mis)information: the political effects of rumors and rumor rebuttals in an authoritarian country,"Despite the prevalence of anti-government rumors in authoritarian countries, little is currently known about their effects on citizens' attitudes toward the government, and whether the authorities can effectively combat rumors. With an experimental procedure embedded in two surveys about Chinese internet users' information exposure, this study finds that rumors decrease citizens' trust in the government and support of the regime. Moreover, individuals from diverse socio-economic and political backgrounds are similarly susceptible to thinly evidenced rumors. Rebuttals generally reduce people's belief in the specific content of rumors, but often do not recover political trust unless the government brings forth solid and vivid evidence to back its refutation or win the endorsement of public figures broadly perceived to be independent. But because such high-quality and strong rebuttals are hard to come by, rumors will Erode political support in an authoritarian state. These findings have rich implications for studies of rumors and misinformation in general, and authoritarian information politics in particular. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.",

However, misconceptions abound, symptoms are often overlooked, and diagnosis frequently occurs in advanced stages. As one step to addressing these issues, this research explores the social construction of ovarian cancer in women’s magazines to identify the ideas and discourses surrounding this illness and interpret their explicit and implicit meanings. A constructivist discourse analytic approach guided analysis of 62 print and online articles from 8 women’s magazines available in Canada over a 20-year period. Analysis resulted in identification of three discourses pertaining to: self-responsibility for health, ovarian cancer as uncertain and inevitably fatal, and ovarian cancer as a heroic endeavour. Critical interpretation highlights misinformation, contradictory beliefs, and unrealistic expectations surrounding this illness, which have implications for healthy and affected women. The findings emphasise the importance of identifying and challenging these discursive constructions to expose inconsistencies, minimise harm to women’s well-being, and promote authentic portrayals of ovarian cancer. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",
10.1098/rsos.160802,processing political misinformation: comprehending the trump phenomenon,"This study investigated the cognitive processing of true and false political information. Specifically, it examined the impact of source credibility on the assessment of veracity when information comes from a polarizing source (Experiment 1), and effectiveness of explanations when they come from one’s own political party or an opposition party (Experiment 2). These experiments were conducted prior to the 2016 Presidential election. Participants rated their belief in factual and incorrect statements that President Trump made on the campaign trail; facts were subsequently affirmed and misinformation retracted. Participants then re-rated their belief immediately or after a delay. Experiment 1 found that (i) if information was attributed to Trump, Republican supporters of Trump believed it more than if it was presented without attribution, whereas the opposite was true for Democrats and (ii) although Trump supporters reduced their belief in misinformation items following a correction, they did not change their voting preferences. Experiment 2 revealed that the explanation’s source had relatively little impact, and belief updating was more influenced by perceived credibility of the individual initially purporting the information. These findings suggest that people use political figures as a heuristic to guide evaluation of what is true or false, yet do not necessarily insist on veracity as a prerequisite for supporting political candidates. © 2017 The Authors.",

In our experiments (N = 429), which follow Loftus's paradigm, we tried to disentangle the reasons for reporting a central and a peripheral piece of misinformation in a recognition task by examining (a) the impact a warning about possible misinformation has on the error rate, and (b) whether once reported misinformation was actually attributed to the witnessed event in a later source-monitoring (SM) task. Overall, a misinformation effect was found for both items. The warning strongly reduced the misinformation effect, but only for the central item. In contrast, reports of the peripheral misinformation were correctly attributed to the misinformation source or, at least, ascribed to guesswork much more often than the central ones. As a consequence, after the SM task, the initially higher error rate for the peripheral item was even lower than that of the central item. Results convincingly show that the reasons for reporting misinformation, and correspondingly also the potential to avoid them in legal settings, depend on the centrality of the misinformation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The aim of the present study was to determine how both the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) procedure and the Misinformation Effect Paradigm tasks were related to each other using distressing and neutral stimuli. Participants completed the DRM (with negative and neutral word lists) and viewed a distressing or neutral film. Misinformation for the film was introduced and memory was assessed. Film accuracy and misinformation susceptibility were found to be greater for those who viewed the distressing film relative to the neutral film. Accuracy responses on both tasks were related, however, susceptibility to the DRM illusion and Misinformation Effect were not. The misinformation findings support the Paradoxical Negative Emotion (PNE) hypothesis that negative stimuli will lead to remembering more accurate details but also greater likelihood of memory distortion. However, the PNE hypothesis was not supported for the DRM results. The findings also suggest that the DRM and Misinformation tasks are not equivalent and may have differences in underlying mechanisms. Future research should focus on more ecologically valid methods of assessing false memory. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",

The majority of the Latvian population also condemns the physical abuse of women; however, the Istanbul Convention which deals with this matter was not ratified here. A number of factors were at play, the most significant of which was pressure exerted through the direct influence of a campaign that had been organised by opponents of the broadest understanding of human rights. Such pressure was exerted on decision makers (MPs and political parties), with indirect impact on the population via social media and the news media outlets. Campaigns by interest groups which spread opposing views are not unusual in a democratic society; however, in this case there was no discussion between the opposing parties. The public domain was not open to an interaction of views and beliefs based on arguments and critical thinking, as the argument of the opponents rested entirely upon their beliefs, whereas the supporters of the convention relied upon valid proof. This article looks at the reasons behind the failure in terms of group communication to establish a constructive discussion on a topic that was so essential to Latvian society: one which served to combat and eradicate violence against women. It also seeks to establish whether the use of an irrational form of convincing technique contradicts the logic of critical thinking, and whether the emergence of unfamiliar and/or incomprehensible concepts on the agenda of a public discussion may serve to put the brakes on the constructive discussion of women’s rights issues which is so essential today to Latvian society as a whole. © ESSACHESS.",
10.1007/978-3-319-24148-7_56,baby and me: single mothers by choice and the artificial reproductive technology marketplace,"This study adopts an interpretive research approach to explore the consumer experiences of a self-identified group, “Single Mothers by Choice” (SMCs). These women are either in the process of becoming mothers, or have attained motherhood, with the help of the assisted reproductive technologies (ART) industry. In the mid-nineties, the fledgling ART industry sought to serve heterosexual couples in (preferably) long-term committed relationships that faced problems in conceiving naturally (Houston, 2004). A decade later, the profit seeking industry’s rapid embrace of “other mothers,” (single and lesbian women) is indicative of an evolving marketplace that is largely unregulated and may be selective of who it serves (Houston, 2004). The potential vulnerabilities of such a marketplace invite further exploration by consumer researchers. Research on motherhood indicates that this life-stage experience involves extensive transitional consumption as women undergo the physical and socio-cultural transformation into becoming mothers. Recent research on new mothers’ consumer experiences (Jennings and O’Malley, 2003; Prothero, 2002; Carrigan and Sczmigin, 2004; Thomsen and Sorensen, 2006; Banister and Hogg, 2006; Voice Group, 2010) challenge dominant theoretical assumptions that consumers are automatically motivated to make informed decisions to consume through transitory life-roles (Voice Group, 2010). In this research we seek to understand the lived experiences of SMCs as they attain motherhood through ART. The first phase of our study consisted of netnographic discourse analysis (Kozinets, 2010) of posts and blogs from select online communities of self-identified SMCs to understand and contextualize their consumption experiences in the ART marketplace. In the second phase of the study we recruited eighteen informants to participate in e-mail and Skype interviews (Ballantine and Creery, 2010). Since we aimed to understand overall consumer experiences in the ART marketplace, we included SMCs who traversed the entire gamut of the motherhood experience. We invited our participants to narrate their life-stories of how they initially decided to become a parent. Interview topics ranged from their reproductive background, romantic relationships, kin and social networks, careers and finances, and ideas about motherhood and family. SMCs exchanged surprisingly candid technical, financial, and medical information in their online discourses. Preliminary findings from data analysis through iterative readings conducted independently by the two authors revealed that many SMCs described receiving positive reception as prospective customers at the ART clinics. However, social exclusion and fear of disapproval from social and kin networks were prominent in these discussions as were signs of defiance and celebration of independent decisions within virtual SMC communities. Womens’ consumption experiences in the ART industry, which due to its position as unregulated and largely unaccountable to customers, has been known to differentially treat single women (straight or lesbian) and heterosexual, married couples (Houston, 2004). In addition, our data analysis include accounts of treatment misinformation, inadequate screening processes of sperm donors, and deliberate withholding of financial obligations indicate a discernible lack of consumer control in a life event fraught with emotional investment in the consumption process. Our findings show that conceiving through ART is the least desirable choice for all women irrespective of their single or married status. ‘Trying to make a baby’ through the conventional route of love, marriage and sex, is portrayed as a positive experience of welcoming a child into the world to a two parent loving family. It is a powerful narrative that is ingrained in the cultural fabric of most societies. ART is often the last, desperate effort to experience pregnancy and biological motherhood for many women (Hertz, 2006). Previous research has indicated that heterosexual couples who resort to ART due to infertility problems draw strength and support from each other as they experience the emotionally and physically strenuous journey to parenthood (Fischer, Otnes and Tuncay, 2007). SMCs on the other hand report loneliness as they contemplate becoming single mothers through ART with the added burden of secrecy for fear of disapproval and exclusion from social networks (Hertz, 2006). In conclusion, our research extends previous research on motherhood related consumer experiences (Fisher, Tuncay and Otnes, 2007; Houston, 2004) by developing a conceptual model that describes the transitional life-stage of SMCs and their interactions with the ART marketplace. The model outlines individual and collective resources of SMCs and other influences that contest and shape their experiences as ART consumers. The model illustrates how the advent of scientific technology, combined with fading boundaries of the digital and physical world of human social networks, influence evolving consumer experiences of women who choose to become mothers without the direct help of Mother Nature. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science.",
10.22055/rals.2017.12610,orientalism beyond belief: critiquing the problematics of v. s. naipaul's islamic excursion,"This study aims to offer a critical analysis of V. S. Naipaul's second Islamic travelogue Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples (1998), which chronicles the author's excursions to the 4 non-Arab Muslim countries of Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, and Malaysia. This critique is presented, firstly, through problematizing the author's theorization on the theme of Muslim conversion- which, according to Naipaul, has bred nothing but neurosis and nihilism in Muslim societies-and then through analyzing representations of the post-Revolutionary Iran of the late 90s. We argue that Naipaul's representations fall within an Orientalist frame of reference in which Iran and its people are portrayed through various tropes of Othering in a narrative fraught with disinformation, exaggerations, and reductive treatment of complex sociopolitical phenomena. Finally, Naipaul's reasoning in formulating conversion coupled with his myopic approach undermine the authenticity of his representations, resulting in what Said (1998) has dubbed ""an intellectual catastrophe of the first order"" (p. 42). © 2017 Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.",

In an experiment, viewers (N = 89) were randomly assigned to watch the episode either with or without an epilogue. Exposure to the epilogue increased recognition of the subtext. It also increased counterarguing against the subtext, but only among viewers less involved with the episode’s story. The epilogue decreased social distance for people with bipolar disorder and decreased their belief that bipolar disorder is not treatable. These findings speak to the utility of epilogues as a tool to both reinforce intended entertainment–education messages and to combat misinformation. This function is particularly useful for entertainment portrayals of stigmatized conditions, which are at greater risk of being misunderstood.

In fact, when an age brings to the foreground the tensions of truthfulness and falsehood, correct information and fake news, reality and fiction, genuineness and delusion, this testifies to the unpredictability and inscrutable nature of the confusion into which public communication has been entrained. The rapid development of new media and digital technologies is causing a far-reaching process of change, especially in the field of politics. In his book on “the post-truth era”, Ralph J. Keyes announced the advent of a “fib-friendly times”, in which “more lies than ever are being told” (Keyes 2004, 4). However, the considerations in this paper rest on a more cautious and critical approach. They support a viewpoint of pluriperspectivism. The new media have surely raised a challenge to contemporary communications. Political affairs are always about certain perspectives and contributions in the constant agon or contest of truth. There is no completely neutral and non-partisan claim to truth, as some philosophers and scientists aspired to represent. Because of its particular nature, the truth can be revealed only with controversy and effort, never without participation and beyond any perspectives. Nevertheless, neither does the truth decline nor do we enter an age of post-truth. Moreover, we can argue about the question which age tends more towards the lie and fake news. Politics is not in a more difficult state today than it has ever been, nor is it in a much simpler position in terms of truth. The truth remains for politics a supporting ground and a permanent benchmark for assessment. It can be discovered only in its pluri-perspective appearance. © 2018 Hratsko Filozofsko Drustvo (Croatian Philosophical Society). All rights reserved.",
10.1093/poq/nfw043,misinformation and motivated reasoning: responses to economic news in a politicized environment,"Public opinion scholars have recently focused on understanding why surveys report such high levels of misinformation among otherwise knowledgeable and engaged partisans. In this paper, we take advantage of a natural experiment involving the October 2012 jobs report announcement to gain a more complete understanding of how individuals' beliefs are influenced by new salient information in a politicized environment. We examine reactions by Republicans and Democrats on a factual question about the unemployment rate immediately before and after the announcement that unemployment had fallen below 8 percent for the first time during the Obama presidency. Using a variety of techniques, including response latency measures, we conclude that partisans did react to the jobs report by engaging in motivated reasoning, providing a clearer understanding of why individuals respond to factual questions in vastly different ways. © The Author 2016.",
10.31620/JCCC.12.18/06,"social media, dietetic practice and misinformation: a triangulation research","Understanding the credibility of social media to produce reliable and factual content is crucial especially in the field of health communication. Social media carries information in multiple layers which is often supported with photographs, images, audio video clips of health experts/trainers, which is further not backed by any sort of certification. Blogs, twitter, Instagram and Facebook are few tools which keep regularly update and track the followers, members as peers on social media. Facebook attracts the maximum and could be considered as power house of such information. It is assumed that some of the groups loading daily dose of fitness might not exist without Facebook. In the present study triangulation method of research is applied to evaluate the awareness and application of information related to diet for health, fitness and reduce body weight. To study interdependencies the research focused on content floated on social media and dietetic practice adopted by the respondents. The research had quantitative and qualitative approach. A survey was conducted by developing a questionnaire. The primary data was collected from 200 respondents of Jalandhar district.

10.1007/s11896-015-9178-1,"misremembering events: emotional valence, psychopathic traits, and the misinformation effect","Past research has demonstrated increased susceptibility to misinformation under varying conditions, including negative emotional scenes. In addition, psychopathic traits have been associated with emotional deficits which may lead to differences in memory processing. The present study examined emotional valence and psychopathic traits in relation to the misinformation effect. Participants (n = 334) were exposed to emotional scenes (positive, neutral, negative), completed a measure of psychopathic traits (PPI-R), and were asked either misleading or nonleading questions. Accuracy and susceptibility to misinformation were assessed through a series of open-ended questions and accuracy scoring. Accuracy was highest for both emotional (60%) relative to neutral (53.9%) images. Memory differences in recall of negative versus positive scenes was evidenced dependent on attentional focus. Participants in the misled condition were less accurate in their recall overall, and recalled more misleading information (41.18% relative to 14.16%). In addition, individuals who received misleading suggestions were more likely to incorporate the major misleading detail into their memory for the negative scene. Psychopathic traits were not related to accuracy; however, those high in psychopathic traits tended to incorporate more misinformation into memory. Our results have important implications concerning how individuals remember emotional events, including people high in psychopathic traits, and follow up studies considering attention/motivation and misinformation are required. © 2015, Society for Police and Criminal Psychology.",
10.1080/07393148.2015.1125119,manipulating citizens: how political campaigns’ use of behavioral social science harms democracy,"Critical theorists in the mid-twentieth century argued that behavioral social science by its nature conceptualizes knowledge as the power to predict and control. As such, rather than serving as a source of enlightenment or emancipation, social science risked functioning as a tool for dominating and manipulating the public. The power of this criticism, however, was undermined by the behavioral revolution’s initial failure to produce theories that offered much prognostic power. Recent methodological and technological developments in the social sciences have begun to generate an impressive ability to predict human behavior, especially when combined with new innovations in marketing and computer science. Disturbingly, political campaigns and interest groups, especially in the US, appropriate this new knowledge to try to alter the beliefs and behaviors of voters. This development bodes ill for US democracy and other liberal democracies where the use of these techniques is likely to increase. It turns citizens into objects of manipulation and undermines the public sphere by thwarting public deliberation, aggravating political polarization, and facilitating the spread of misinformation. © 2016 Caucus for a New Political Science.",
10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4720-13.2014,brain substrates of recovery from misleading influence,"Humans are strongly influenced by their environment, a dependence that can lead to errors in judgment. Although a rich literature describes how people are influenced by others, little is known regarding the factors that predict subsequent rectification of misleading influence. Using a mediation model in combination with brain imaging, we propose a model for the correction of misinformation. Specifically, our data suggest that amygdala modulation of hippocampal mnemonic representations, during the time of misleading social influence, is associated with reduced subsequent anterior-lateral prefrontal cortex activity that reflects correction. These findings illuminate the process by which erroneous beliefs are, or fail to be, rectified and highlight how past influence constrains subsequent correction. © 2014 Edelson et al.",
10.1108/JME-05-2015-0014,the perils of arab american adolescents post 9/11,"Purpose: This paper aims to describe patterns of experiences and perceptions of inclusion and accuracy of Arab American culture in the multicultural paradigm in schools through the voices of Arab American youth. Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out using a survey research design. Qualitative reports of experiences in school were obtained using open-ended questionnaires. Findings: The reports were examined for themes regarding specific types of experiences and for types of inaccuracies taught about Arab culture in schools. Categories that arose for experiences included bullying/harassment, racial stereotyping and religious stereotyping of Arabs. Half of the sample reported that the culture is not represented in the multicultural paradigm in their school. Themes arising from curricular inaccuracies include misinformation involving stereotypes and biases. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include generalizability due to research design and sampling methods. Future research may use multiple methods of collecting this type of information, such as focus groups, observations and face-to-face interviews with participants. Practical implications: These experiences may affect students’ sense of belonging and inclusion in their schools, which may affect academic and social growth. Strategies for school staff to implement in their schools are provided. Results may be used to inform environmental, policy and curricular reform in schools. Originality/value: This study is one of the few to provide qualitative descriptions of Arab American’s experiences in the schools. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",
10.1007/s11077-013-9187-9,scientific opinion in policymaking: the case of climate change adaptation,"The urgent need for policy decisions often outpaces scientific discovery. At such times, policymakers must rely on scientific opinion. This is the case with many aspects of current climate policy, especially those involving untested but potentially necessary adaptations to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Unfortunately, scientific opinion is not currently defined, measured, or used in a standardized way, which often allows for the accidental or intentional dissemination of misinformation and the marginalization of science where science could be most beneficial. In this article, we argue that scientific opinion can be usefully measured by systematic surveys of scientists that employ standards similar to those that govern public opinion surveys, including systematic decisions about target populations, sampling frames, and sampling techniques. We demonstrate this approach with the methodology for a study of scientific opinion on a potential adaptation to climate change, the managed relocation of species. We show that survey results may be used to corroborate other types of information, refine or contradict other information, and offer novel insights into emerging issues, such as adaptations to climate change, that are currently not addressed with any other type of available information. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",
NA,individual differences associated with the repeated endorsement of post-event misinformation,"The current study used a multi-event design to evaluate the misinformation effect and to assess the role of previously unexplored individual difference factors in repeated misinformation responding. Eighty-six participants observed four obscure film clips and received misleading information after viewing some of them. The results indicated similar accuracy, proportions of misinformation endorsement and repeated susceptibility classification as shown in other multiple event misinformation studies. Eight items reliably produced the misinformation effect. Misinformation susceptible individuals had a lack of calibration between confidence and accuracy for misinformation items, a greater desire to please, greater externally oriented thinking, and a stronger belief in a just world, when compared with individuals who did not repeatedly demonstrate susceptibility. Each of these factors, except belief in a just world, significantly predicted misinformation susceptibility. Although hypothesized based on previous studies, dissociation and memory accuracy were not related to misinformation susceptibility. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",
10.1007/s11213-009-9146-8,"migration, ethnicity and privilege: an exploration of representation and accountability","Representation assumes that those who govern have knowledge of those for whom they govern. It is easy to presume knowledge of the ""other"", but as we know this can be based in prejudice, cultural difference, or simply misinformation or simplification. Usually our explorations of this process have focused on populations identified as disadvantaged, disempowered or somehow ""non-privileged"". However, the research process outlined here has revealed previously unexplored diversity within a population commonly described as privileged suggesting that good governance requires alertness to presuming to know both the unprivileged and the privileged. The research approach outlined in this paper has used a blend of historical reappraisal and qualitative techniques focusing on a population who have been conceptualized as doubly privileged. This population focus is that of older British; post World War II male migrants in South Australia. These people have been conceptualized as privileged because they are male, and they were part of the preferred ethnic group that Australian politicians and policy makers favoured post WW2. However, review of the historical data and qualitative interviews with some of these men show that the accepted narrative of a homogenous pre-WW2 British origin population is over simplistic. The historical research suggests that the presumption that post WW2 British migrant men were coming into an homogenous, privileging environment in migrating to SA is both ahistorical and crude. Furthermore the belief that post WW2 British migrant men were ethnically homogenous is undermined by the qualitative research, that reveals that their presumed homogeneity is much more fluid and nuanced than dominant conceptualisations have allowed. The impact of core ethnicities that continue to exist and compete in Britain, the social class focus and economic commodification of migrants in the machinations of powerful players in the state of South Australia all confound homogenizing, simplistic knowing of British migrant men in this state. Generically these findings caution social researchers with regard to presuming to know so called ""privileged"" populations as well as presumed non-privileged groups. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",
10.5964/ejop.v7i3.147,role of arousal states in susceptibility to accept misinformation,"The fragile nature of eyewitness memory makes the witnesses susceptible to various sources of post event information. Many factors of individual differences further moderate the impact of misinformation. The experiment reported here attempts to explore the effects of post event information on recognition accuracy of witnessed events, as moderated by the arousal states of energetic arousal, tense arousal, hedonic tone and anger/frustration. Experiment used those participants who scored high on four arousal states and average on rest of the three arousal states. Participants viewed a video clip, depicting a murder, followed by presentation of one week delayed post event information and recognition test for details of the event. Results indicated that participants who were misled retained less number of details of the event than did the participants who were given either consistent or no post event information. High scorer energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants retained more details of the event than did the high scorer tense arousal and anger/frustration participants under all the three post event information conditions. However, high tense arousal and anger/frustration participants' eyewitness retention dropped more sharply when they were given misleading post event information in comparison to the high energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants. Thus, results of the study indicated a moderating effect of post event information by the arousal states. © 2005-2011 Europe's Journal of Psychology.",

They make up a module that checks the reliability and believability of informers and information. Vigilance mechanisms may also comprise a sub-set of specialised mechanisms safeguarding hearers from interpretative mistakes conducive to misunderstanding by triggering an attitude of hermeneutical vigilance (Padilla Cruz 2014). This causes individuals to check the plausibility and acceptability of interpretative hypotheses appearing optimally relevant.

10.3758/CABN.10.3.339,"comparison of neural activity that leads to true memories, false memories, and forgetting: an fmri study of the misinformation effect","False memories can occur when people are exposed to misinformation about a past event. Of interest here are the neural mechanisms of this type of memory failure. In the present study, participants viewed photographic vignettes of common activities during an original event phase (OEP), while we monitored their brain activity using fMRI. Later, in a misinformation phase, participants viewed sentences describing the studied photographs, some of which contained information conflicting with that depicted in the photographs. One day later, participants returned for a surprise item memory recognition test for the content of the photographs. Results showed reliable creation of false memories, in that participants reported information that had been presented in the verbal misinformation but not in the photographs. Several regions were more active during the OEP for later accurate memory than for forgetting, but they were also more active for later false memories, indicating that false memories in this paradigm are not simply caused by failure to encode the original event. There was greater activation in the ventral visual stream for subsequent true memories than for subsequent false memories, however, suggesting that differences in encoding may contribute to later susceptibility to misinformation. © 2010 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1002/acp.1694,trace-strength and source-monitoring accounts of accuracy and metacognitive resolution in the misinformation paradigm,"Two experiments are reported that investigate the impact of misinformation on memory accuracy and metacognitive resolution. In Experiment 1, participants viewed a series of photographs depicting a crime scene, were exposed to misinformation that contradicted details in the slides, and later took a recognition memory test. For each answer, participants were required to indicate whether they were willing to testify (report) their answer to the Court and to rate confidence. Misinformation impaired memory accuracy but it had no effect on resolution, regardless of whether resolution was indexed with confidence-rating measures (γ correlation and mean confidence) or a report-option measure (type-2 discrimination: d'). In Experiment 2, a similar accuracy-confidence dissociation was found, and the misinformation effect occurred mostly with fine-grained responses, suggesting that responding was based on recollected details. We argue that the results support source-monitoring (SM) accounts of accuracy and resolution rather than accounts based on trace strength. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Current epidemiology indicates that among Pacific Islanders in the United States, young adults are at highest risk of HIV and HPV. In our inductive community based participatory research study, we used focus groups and key informant interviews (March-August 2010) with young adults, parents, community leaders, and providers (n = 95) to identify and contextualize factors that shape HIV and HPV risk and prevention among young adults in Chamorro and Tongan communities in Southern California. We identified nine themes that incorporated the following principal factors: misinformation and otherization; dominant concerns regarding premarital pregnancy; restricted intergenerational communication; family shame and privacy; gendered manifestations of religio-cultural norms; barriers impeding access to sexual health resources; parents' role in prevention; community vs. individual responsibility; and family and ethnic pride. Our thematic findings fit well with Rhodes' ""risk and enabling environment"" heuristic (2009), which we used to contextualize risk and prevention at micro and macro levels of physical, social, economic, and policy environments. We propose the addition of a separate cultural environment to the heuristic and conclude that a focus on applying individual and community agency at the micro-level would be an approachable starting point for intervention for our local Pacific Islander communities and groups in similar ecological contexts globally. Enhanced community-led education programs and engagement of religious and other community leaders to facilitate intergenerational communication could counteract taboos that obstruct prevention. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Findings indicated misinformation on HIV/AIDS, distrust for service providers among the participants, stigma impacts health-seeking behavior, and a need for providing culturally informed services. To ensure that Haitian Americans living with HIV/AIDS access appropriate services, health care providers need to ensure their programs and staff address cultural attitudes, beliefs, and expectations.

In an experiment (N = 371), we identified journalistic balance as a source of misperception about this issue and examined ways to attenuate misperceptions. In particular, by including weight-of-evidence information (i.e., stating that only one view is supported by evidence and a scientific consensus), we explored whether an article can present conflicting views without causing misperceptions. Including weight-of-evidence information fostered more accurate beliefs about an autism-vaccine link, but only for people with favorable pre-existing scientific views. However, this conditional effect disappeared when visual exemplars accompanied weight-of-evidence information. The findings of this study have both theoretical and practical implications for science communication. © 2015 International Communication Association.",
NA,positive pychology: zeigeist (or spirit of the times) or ignorance (or disinformation) of history?,"This paper provides a critical review of Positive Psychology as a paradigm. From its origins in the late 1990s, Positive Psychology has acquired great popularity without any critical thinking. The dissemination of its un-innovative discourse in the mass media and specialized journals is an example of the popularity it has gained. This unquestioned acceptance of the discourse of Positive Psychology has taken place all over the world, including Spain and Latin America. After reviewing the general characteristics of Positive Psychology, the article discusses the shortcomings that this paradigm should overcome to be considered reliable and valid. Succinctly, the review concludes that the theoretical approach of Positive Psychology is not novel. The discourse that supports positive psychology as a new and original approach is in fact an exhibition of disinformation and ignorance of Philosophy, cultural Anthropology and the history of Psychology. In conclusion, the future of Positive Psychology requires overcoming the serious theoretical and practical problems that prevent it from being considered a new paradigm. © International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology.",

Discussion can change memory, especially when the source of new information is highly credible. But we do not know whether the effects of credibility are based on absolute judgments - judging a source's credibility independently from our own credibility - or relative judgments - judging a source's credibility only in relation to our own credibility. We addressed this question by manipulating subjects' expectations, leading them to believe that they either had the same, higher or lower ""visual acuity"" than their partner while they watched a movie together. To create ample opportunities for the pairs to mention misleading details to one another, each member unknowingly saw a different version of the movie. The pairs then discussed some of the critical differences, but not others. Later, everyone took an independent recognition test. Subjects' susceptibility to misinformation depended on their own credibility relative to their partner's, supporting the idea that susceptibility to misinformation depends on relative differences in credibility. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

The present study examined changes in linguistic markers present in verbal reports in the context of a repeated-retrieval misinformation study. After witnessing an event, an immediate retrieval group engaged in a free-recall test associated with the event. The delayed retrieval group completed a filler task. Following, all participants were presented with a post-event narrative that included neutral, consistent, and misleading details. Both groups then took two free-recall tests. We found that hesitations were more likely to accompany correctly remembered details if those details were altered in the narrative, than if there was consistency between the original event and narrative. We also found that retrieval prior to misinformation positively influenced the inclusion of hesitations in free-recall reports that immediately followed the narrative. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
10.1007/s11229-011-9992-7,"the information effect: constructive memory, testimony, and epistemic luck","The incorporation of post-event testimonial information into an agent's memory representation of the event via constructive memory processes gives rise to the misinformation effect, in which the incorporation of inaccurate testimonial information results in the formation of a false memory belief. While psychological research has focussed primarily on the incorporation of inaccurate information, the incorporation of accurate information raises a particularly interesting epistemological question: do the resulting memory beliefs qualify as knowledge? It is intuitively plausible that they do not, for they appear to be only luckily true. I argue, however, that, despite its intuitive plausibility, this view is mistaken: once we adopt an adequate (modal) conception of epistemic luck and an adequate (adaptive) general approach to memory, it becomes clear that memory beliefs resulting from the incorporation of accurate testimonial information are not in general luckily true. I conclude by sketching some implications of this argument for the psychology of memory, suggesting that the misinformation effect would better be investigated in the context of a broader ""information effect"". © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",

Loftus (2003) reveals that misleading information presented to participants after watching a short film clip often results in participants subsequently adopting the misled information as a true memory. The current study employs the misinformation paradigm to investigate the effect of immediate forced false responses on delayed recognition memory accuracy and confidence for a simulated crime scene. It was predicted that forcing participants to make false responses on a multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after viewing the video would decrease delayed memory accuracy in a week-later testing, especially for peripheral compared to central details. Additionally, experimenters predicted for low levels of confidence to be correlated with the forced false responses in the initial testing phase and an increase in confidence responses in a week-later testing. The results were highly significant. The implications of these findings for future research on the misinformation effect are discussed in light of the source attribution error hypothesis. © Common Ground, Katherine Du Toit, Lindsey Smith, Ira Konstantinou.",

Although a few recent studies support the benefits of rapport building on adult witness recall, no study has examined whether the timing of rapport in relation to post-event misinformation affects recall accuracy, and whether these effects are related to witness anxiety levels throughout the interview. The present study provided two hundred and thirty-three undergraduates with a videotaped mock crime followed by building high or low rapport either before or after they received post-event misinformation. All witnesses were then interviewed about the mock crime. Results indicated that high rapport before misinformation increased the amount of accurate information reported in a subsequent witness interview compared to low rapport. However, these recall benefits were not due to a reduction in anxiety. Theoretical implications and practical recommendations for police interviewing practices are discussed. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",
10.1080/00918360903005295,the last book-burning trial of the twentieth century: the såtlström dissertation and the challenge of homophobic authority,"Anti-homosexual (also known as homophobic) values, attitudes, and beliefs thrive, in part, on misinformation and by restricting discussion that might challenge such views. While this was more typical of academic environments in the 1950s, partly because the study of homosexuality was largely based on clinical or correctional populations, academic environments have usually been in the forefront of empirical and social discussion of sexuality. Preventing such discussion (which maintains outdated pathological or criminal theories of homosexuality), thus becomes a significant agenda of those attempting to maintain anti-homosexual attitudes. Further, when anti-homosexual attitudes have characterized a particular professional group, prevention of any discussion that may reveal that the position of that group was without empirical foundation also serves the function of maintaining their authority as experts and allows restrictions on the human rights of homosexual or bisexual individuals to go unchallenged. Rarely, however, has this resulted in a direct attempt to silence academic discussion, through the invocation of legal sanctions. This article looks at the history of such an attempt in Finland, where an adherent of classical psychoanalysis fought to challenge progress and reverse the tide of scientific and clinical evidence that judged homosexuality to be non-pathological.",

Enormous misinformation arising from the global hegemony of Western languages conceals important complexities of African life from view to planners of mission and development. Particularly in focus is the centrality of feast and celebration in Africa's economic and social life.

We found significant lagged associations between health (mis)information exposure and beliefs for three topics; beliefs predicted subsequent intentions for 2 topics; and intentions predicted subsequent behaviors for 4 topics. The hypothesized pathway of effects was supported for 2 topics.

10.1111/ajps.12162,the effect of fact-checking on elites: a field experiment on u.s. state legislators,"Does external monitoring improve democratic performance? Fact-checking has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat. © 2014, Midwest Political Science Association.",
10.1037/cep0000014,will your words become mine? underlying processes and cowitness intimacy in the memory conformity paradigm.,"Eyewitness reports become less accurate after exposure to inconsistent information. When such phenomenon of diminishing accuracy occurs among cowitnesses, it is termed memory conformity or the social contagion effect. The present study set out to provide a rigorous test of the underlying mechanisms with particular emphasis on investigating whether genuine false memory is involved. To this end, we conducted an earwitness experiment in which some participants were exposed to discrepant cowitness information and provided their recollections repeatedly and under different conditions. Additionally, we examined the impact of cowitness intimacy by using a random assignment procedure, an aspect that has not been previously studied. With regard to the underlying processes, our findings clearly argue that informational rather than normative influence plays a dominant role. Moreover, highly accurate source attributions indicated that participants were aware of drawing on the recollection of their counterparts. Consequently, we did not obtain any evidence for false memory. With regard to cowitness intimacy, the results were inconsistent and call for further research. © 2014 Canadian Psychological Association.",
10.1002/acp.1789,a comfortable witness is a good witness: rapport-building and susceptibility to misinformation in an investigative mock-crime interview,"Major investigative interviewing protocols such as the Cognitive Interview recommend that investigators build rapport with cooperative adult witnesses at the beginning of a police interview. Although research substantiates the benefits of rapport-building on the accuracy of child witness reports, few studies have examined whether similar benefits apply to adult witnesses. The present study investigated whether verbal rapport-building techniques increase adult witness report accuracy and decrease their susceptibility to post-event misinformation. One-hundred eleven college adults viewed a videotaped mock-crime, received post-event misinformation (or correct information) about the crime, and were subsequently interviewed by a research assistant who built rapport (or did not build rapport) before recalling the mock-crime.

10.1017/XPS.2014.22,displacing misinformation about events: an experimental test of causal corrections,"Misinformation can be very difficult to correct and may have lasting effects even after it is discredited. One reason for this persistence is the manner in which people make causal inferences based on available information about a given event or outcome. As a result, false information may continue to influence beliefs and attitudes even after being debunked if it is not replaced by an alternate causal explanation. We test this hypothesis using an experimental paradigm adapted from the psychology literature on the continued influence effect and find that a causal explanation for an unexplained event is significantly more effective than a denial even when the denial is backed by unusually strong evidence. This result has significant implications for how to most effectively counter misinformation about controversial political events and outcomes. © The Experimental Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2015.",

10.1002/acp.2845,improving the accuracy of eyewitnesses in the presence of misinformation with the plurality option,"Misinformation has negative effects in the accuracy of eyewitnesses' reports. We investigated whether those negative effects could be reduced when participants are allowed to decide how many answers to include in their answers, that is, to regulate the plurality option. Participants watched a slideshow and received misinformation through a narrative. In the recognition memory test, participants had to select, out of five alternatives, one (single) and then three alternatives (plural answer) and to indicate which one they preferred to report if they were in a courtroom. Perceived likelihood ratings were also collected. Results showed that the regulation of the plurality option increased accuracy even in the presence of misinformation and highlighted the importance of the perceived likelihood ratings in the decision to select a single or plural answer. In general, the results suggest that better testimonies could be obtained if witnesses are given some control over their answers. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

10.1093/poq/nft080,public misunderstanding of political facts: how question wording affected estimates of partisan differences in birtherism,"In 2010 and 2011, highly visible national surveys documented frequent failure among the public, especially among Republicans, to acknowledge that Barack Obama was born in the United States. However, different questions yielded strikingly different results. The highest rate of partisan division was generated by a CBS/New York Times closed-ended question that included potentially leading introductory sentences. The smallest partisan gap in apparent misinformation was generated by an ABC News/Washington Post open-ended question that did not ask a follow-up that was needed to gauge public beliefs about whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States. This paper reviews the polls on birtherism and describes an experiment embedded in a nationally representative sample survey testing whether methodological features of these two questions might have distorted their results and caused the apparent discrepancy between them. A version of the closed-ended question including the leading introductory sentences yielded a much larger degree of apparent partisan division than did a version of the question without the introductory sentences. Following the open question with another question that clarified people's beliefs (asking about whether Hawaii was part of the United States at the time of Barack Obama's birth) did not alter the conclusions supported by that item about the accuracy of public understanding. This study therefore illustrates how different question wording caused different polls to produce notably different results and provides a caution about the use of potentially leading wording. © The Author 2014.",

Heuristic and motivated reasoning literatures suggest that voters' preexisting values interact with political sophistication such that politically knowledgeable voters develop systematically distorted empirical beliefs relevant to the initiatives on their ballots. These beliefs, in turn, can predict voting preferences even after controlling for underlying values, regardless of one's political sophistication. These hypotheses were tested using a 2003 voter survey conducted prior to a statewide initiative election that repealed a workplace safety regulation. Results showed that only those voters knowledgeable of key endorsements had initiative-specific beliefs that lined up with their underlying antiregulation values. Also, voters' empirical beliefs had an effect on initiative support even after controlling for prior values, and political sophistication did not moderate this effect. © 2009 International Society of Political Psychology.",
10.1016/j.paid.2010.06.005,the psychology of interrogative suggestibility: a vulnerability during interview,"This study uses structural equation modelling to investigate the psychological mechanism underpinning interrogative suggestibility on the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale (GSS). It considers the relationship between neuroticism (vulnerability especially) and compliance within the Five-Factor personality model, fearful avoidant attachment (FAA), the experience of intense negative life events (iNLE) and interrogative suggestibility. Each participant completed the GSS 1, the Life Events Questionnaire, the Relationship Scale Questionnaire, and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Findings show that: (i) vulnerability and FAA correlate; FAA patterns indirectly affect misinformation acceptance both in the absence of pressure (Yield 1) and in response to pressure (Yield 2) through iNLE. (ii) FAA patterns and compliance indirectly affect sensitivity to interrogative pressure (Shift scores) through iNLE. An endogenous tendency towards distress, FAA, and compliant tendencies (with respect to Shift scores) may be the basis of individual differences in interrogative suggestibility. This could manifest as false statements and inconsistencies in answer during questioning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",
10.1002/acp.1637,treat and trick: a new way to increase false memory,"This paper reports a new experimental manipulation that increased false memories 1 month after the manipulation. Mirroring the standard three-stage misinformation paradigm (original event, misinformation, and test), subjects in the experimental group were first given a colour-slide presentation of two stories (events), then given an accurate account (instead of misinformation) of the events in narrations, and finally tested for their memory of the original events. One month later, they underwent the standard misinformation paradigm with two new events. The comparison group was given the standard misinformation tasks at both time points. Results showed that the experimental group produced more false memories in the subsequent misinformation paradigm than did the comparison group. We focus on trust and credibility as possible mechanisms underlying this effect. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
10.2202/1540-8884.1354,"why the ""death panel"" myth wouldn't die: misinformation in the health care reform debate","Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama struggled to overcome widespread and persistent myths about their proposals to reform the American health care system. Their difficulties highlight the influence of factual misinformation in national politics and the extent to which it correlates with citizens' political views. In this essay, I explain how greater elite polarization and the growth in media choice have reinforced the partisan divide in factual beliefs. To illustrate these points, I analyze debates over health care reform in 1993-1994 and 2009-2010, tracing the spread of false claims about reform proposals from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and analyzing the prevalence of misinformation in public opinion. Since false beliefs are extremely difficult to correct, I conclude by arguing that increasing the reputational costs for dishonest elites might be a more effective approach to improving democratic discourse.

10.1016/j.nlm.2013.09.008,encoding negative events under stress: high subjective arousal is related to accurate emotional memory despite misinformation exposure,"Stress at encoding affects memory processes, typically enhancing, or preserving, memory for emotional information. These effects have interesting implications for eyewitness accounts, which in real-world contexts typically involve encoding an aversive event under stressful conditions followed by potential exposure to misinformation. The present study investigated memory for a negative event encoded under stress and subsequent misinformation endorsement. Healthy young adults participated in a between-groups design with three experimental sessions conducted 48. h apart. Session one consisted of a psychosocial stress induction (or control task) followed by incidental encoding of a negative slideshow. During session two, participants were asked questions about the slideshow, during which a random subgroup was exposed to misinformation. Memory for the slideshow was tested during the third session. Assessment of memory accuracy across stress and no-stress groups revealed that stress induced just prior to encoding led to significantly better memory for the slideshow overall. The classic misinformation effect was also observed - participants exposed to misinformation were significantly more likely to endorse false information during memory testing. In the stress group, however, memory accuracy and misinformation effects were moderated by arousal experienced during encoding of the negative event. Misinformed-stress group participants who reported that the negative slideshow elicited high arousal during encoding were less likely to endorse misinformation for the most aversive phase of the story. Furthermore, these individuals showed better memory for components of the aversive slideshow phase that had been directly misinformed. Results from the current study provide evidence that stress and high subjective arousal elicited by a negative event act concomitantly during encoding to enhance emotional memory such that the most aversive aspects of the event are well remembered and subsequently more resistant to misinformation effects. © 2013 The Authors.",
10.1080/09658211.2013.779381,adaptive constructive processes and memory accuracy: consequences of counterfactual simulations in young and older adults,"People frequently engage in counterfactual thinking: mental simulations of alternative outcomes to past events. Like simulations of future events, counterfactual simulations serve adaptive functions. However, future simulation can also result in various kinds of distortions and has thus been characterised as an adaptive constructive process. Here we approach counterfactual thinking as such and examine whether it can distort memory for actual events. In Experiments 1a/b young and older adults imagined themselves experiencing different scenarios. Participants then imagined the same scenario again, engaged in no further simulation of a scenario, or imagined a counterfactual outcome. On a subsequent recognition test participants were more likely to make false alarms to counterfactual lures than novel scenarios. Older adults were more prone to these memory errors than younger adults. In Experiment 2 younger and older participants selected and performed different actions, then recalled performing some of those actions, imagined performing alternative actions to some of the selected actions, and did not imagine others. Participants, especially older adults, were more likely to falsely remember counterfactual actions than novel actions as previously performed. The findings suggest that counterfactual thinking can cause source confusion based on internally generated misinformation, consistent with its characterisation as an adaptive constructive process. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",
10.1177/1529100612451018,misinformation and its correction: continued influence and successful debiasing,"The widespread prevalence and persistence of misinformation in contemporary societies, such as the false belief that there is a link between childhood vaccinations and autism, is a matter of public concern. For example, the myths surrounding vaccinations, which prompted some parents to withhold immunization from their children, have led to a marked increase in vaccine-preventable disease, as well as unnecessary public expenditure on research and public-information campaigns aimed at rectifying the situation.We first examine the mechanisms by which such misinformation is disseminated in society, both inadvertently and purposely. Misinformation can originate from rumors but also from works of fiction, governments and politicians, and vested interests. Moreover, changes in the media landscape, including the arrival of the Internet, have fundamentally influenced the ways in which information is communicated and misinformation is spread.We next move to misinformation at the level of the individual, and review the cognitive factors that often render misinformation resistant to correction. We consider how people assess the truth of statements and what makes people believe certain things but not others. We look at people's memory for misinformation and answer the questions of why retractions of misinformation are so ineffective in memory updating and why efforts to retract misinformation can even backfire and, ironically, increase misbelief. Though ideology and personal worldviews can be major obstacles for debiasing, there nonetheless are a number of effective techniques for reducing the impact of misinformation, and we pay special attention to these factors that aid in debiasing.We conclude by providing specific recommendations for the debunking of misinformation. These recommendations pertain to the ways in which corrections should be designed, structured, and applied in order to maximize their impact. Grounded in cognitive psychological theory, these recommendations may help practitioners-including journalists, health professionals, educators, and science communicators-design effective misinformation retractions, educational tools, and public-information campaigns. © The Author(s) 2012.",
NA,"meaning, purpose, and cause in the law of deception","Many laws address the flow of information between private parties. Familiar examples include the torts of deceit, negligent misrepresentation, nondisclosure, and defamation; criminal fraud statutes; securities law, which includes both disclosure duties and penalties for false statements; false advertising law; labeling requirements for food, drugs, and other consumer goods; and, according to recent scholarship, information-forcing penalty defaults in contract law and elsewhere. Taken together, these and similar laws constitute what I will call the ""law of deception."" They regulate the flow of information between private parties to prevent dishonesty, disinformation, artifice, cover-up, and other forms of trickery, or to avert mistake, misunderstanding, miscalculation, and other types of false belief.

10.1177/0956797610366082,truth is at hand: how gesture adds information during investigative interviews,"The accuracy of information obtained in forensic interviews is critically important to credibility in the legal system. Research has shown that the way interviewers frame questions influences the accuracy of witnesses' reports. A separate body of research has shown that speakers gesture spontaneously when they talk and that these gestures can convey information not found anywhere in the speakers' words. In our study, which joins these two literatures, we interviewed children about an event that they had witnessed. Our results demonstrate that (a) interviewers' gestures serve as a source of information (and, at times, misinformation) that can lead witnesses to report incorrect details, and (b) the gestures witnesses spontaneously produce during interviews convey substantive information that is often not conveyed anywhere in their speech, and thus would not appear in written transcripts of the proceedings. These findings underscore the need to attend to, and document, gestures produced in investigative interviews, particularly interviews conducted with children. © 2010 The Author(s).",

We tested the hypotheses that (a) reliance on misinformation is affected by people's preexisting attitudes and (b) attitudes determine the effectiveness of retractions. In two experiments, participants scoring higher and lower on a racial prejudice scale read a news report regarding a robbery. In one scenario, the suspects were initially presented as being Australian Aboriginals, whereas in a second scenario, a hero preventing the robbery was introduced as an Aboriginal person. Later, these critical, race-related pieces of information were or were not retracted. We measured participants' reliance on misinformation in response to inferential reasoning questions. The results showed that preexisting attitudes influence people's use of attitude-related information but not the way in which a retraction of that information is processed. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",

We examined how exposure to an ad for a fictitious prescription drug that appeared to offer benefits and risks superior to normative standards for asthma medication (i.e., a simulated violative ad) and a corresponding corrective ad shaped viewer perceptions, understanding, and intended behavior. Through an experiment with 1,057 participants, we found that a corrective ad counteracted viewer belief of an overstatement of efficacy claim, but was less successful in counteracting omission of risk. Corrective ad exposure also affected general viewer perceptions of, and intended behaviors toward, the drug. © 2015 International Communication Association.",
NA,"describing or distorting the ""turk""?: the relazioni of the venetian ambassadors in constantinople as historical source","Since at least the time of Leopold von Ranke, the famed final reports, or relazioni, of the Venetian ambassadors have enjoyed a unique reputation among historical testimonies. Historians have often viewed the Venetian ambassadors as dispassionate and sophisticated witnesses of the courts in which they served, and treated their reports, often uncritically, as unbiased and fully reliable appraisals. More recently, however, some scholars have cast doubts on the their value and indeed their validity as historical testimonies. Critiques have tended to focus on two perceived problems: First, the sources are of little value because Venetian diplomats were not privy to the most sensitive and important political information, and therefore their reports are rife with hearsay and misinformation. Second, and more damning, Venetian diplomats are accused of being hopelessly biased and Veneto-centric and therefore inaccurate and unreliable reporters, rendering their relazioni useful not as testimonies of the cultures observed, but as windows into the cultural attitudes and values of the observers. Ironically, these challenges have originated primarily from scholars of Venice, precisely at a time when the relazioni are being rediscovered and revalued by scholars of the Ottoman Empire. In this paper I focus on the Venetian relazioni on the Ottoman Empire, and argue that while the relazioni have much to tell us both about the individuals and the ruling class that produced them, when reconsidered within the institutional context in which they were generated, these reports, while not the ideal and idealized source of Ranke, still can provide an accurate window onto the political and cultural realities of the Ottomans, as well as the attitudes and concerns of Venice. The relazioni do not simply represent an imagined or invented Ottoman Empire, nor do they merely refract the likeness of their authors onto the Ottoman visage. While the relazioni certainly construct an image of the Ottoman Empire, it is not always or entirely created in Venice's self-image.",
10.1007/s11109-014-9287-z,do i think bls data are bs? the consequences of conspiracy theories,"While the willingness of people to believe unfounded and conspiratorial explanations of events is fascinating and troubling, few have addressed the broader impacts of the dissemination of conspiracy claims. We use survey experiments to assess whether realistic exposure to a conspiracy claim affects conspiracy beliefs and trust in government. These experiments yield interesting and potentially surprising results. We discover that respondents who are asked whether they believe in a conspiracy claim after reading a specific allegation actually report lower beliefs than those not exposed to the specific claim. Turning to trust in government, we find that exposure to a conspiracy claim has a potent negative effect on trust in government services and institutions including those unconnected to the allegations. Moreover, and consistent with our belief experiment, we find that first asking whether people believe in the conspiracy mitigates the negative trust effects. Combining these findings suggests that conspiracy exposure increases conspiracy beliefs and reduces trust, but that asking about beliefs prompts additional thinking about the claims which softens and/or reverses the exposure’s effect on beliefs and trust. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Typically, subjects in the misled experimental group report more false details than those from the control group. The main purpose of the presented study was to compare two methods of reducing the misinformation effect, namely - warning against misinformation and reinforced self-affi rmation. The reinforced self-affi rmation consists of two elements: the participants recall their greatest achievements of life, and are being given a positive feedback about their performance in a memory task. The obtained results showed that the reinforced self-affi rmation was more effective than warning, although the latter also caused a signifi cant reduction of the vulnerability to misinformation.",
10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00935.x,beliefs don't always persevere: how political figures are punished when positive information about them is discredited,"Recent research has extended the belief-perseverance paradigm to the political realm, showing that negative information about political figures has a persistent effect on political opinions even after it has been discredited. However, little is known about the effects of false positive information about political figures. In three experiments, we find that discrediting positive information generates a ""punishment effect"" that is inconsistent with the previous literature on belief perseverance. We argue people attempt to adjust for the perceived influence of the false claim when the information is discredited. In this case, when trying to account for the effects of discredited positive information about a politician, people overestimate how much correction is needed and thus end up with a more negative opinion. (By contrast, people underestimate how much correction is needed to adjust for false negative information, leading to belief perseverance.) These results suggest that bogus credit claiming or other positive misinformation can have severe repercussions for politicians. © 2012 International Society of Political Psychology.",

10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.06.006,confidence-accuracy resolution in the misinformation paradigm is influenced by the availability of source cues,"After witnessing an event, people often report having seen details that were merely suggested to them. Evidence is mixed regarding how well participants can use confidence judgments to discriminate between their correct and misled memory reports. We tested the prediction that the confidence-accuracy relationship for misled details depends upon the availability of source cues at retrieval. In Experiment 1, participants (N=77) viewed a videotaped staged crime before reading a misleading narrative. After seven minutes or one week, the participants completed a cued recall test for the details of the original event. Prior to completing the test, all participants were warned that the narrative contained misleading details to encourage source monitoring. The results showed that the strength of the confidence-accuracy relationship declined significantly over the delay. We interpret our results in the source monitoring framework. After an extended delay, fewer diagnostic source details were available to participants, increasing reliance on retrieval fluency as a basis for memory and metamemory decisions. We tested this interpretation in a second experiment, in which participants (N=42) completed a source monitoring test instead of a cued recall test. We observed a large effect of retention interval on source monitoring, and no significant effect on item memory. This research emphasizes the importance of securing eyewitness statements as soon as possible after an event, when witnesses are most able to discriminate between information that was personally seen and information obtained from secondary sources. © 2014.",
NA,a social diffusion model of misinformation and disinformation for understanding human information behaviour,"Introduction. People enjoy sharing information, even when they do not believe it. Thus, misinformation (inaccurate information) and disinformation (deceptive information) diffuse throughout social networks, as misinforming and disinforming are varieties of information behaviour. Social media have made such diffusion easier and faster. Many information behaviour models, however, suggest a normative model of information as true, accurate, complete, despite the ubiquity of misinformation and disinformation. Analysis. Misinformation and disinformation are defined and we show how they extend the concept of information through their informativeness. Table 1 summarizes the features of information, misinformation, and disinformation. Figure 1 illustrates the social diffusion process by which misinforming and disinforming function as types of information behaviour. Conclusion. Misinformation and disinformation are closely linked to information literacy, especially in terms of how they are diffused and shared and how people use both cues to credibility and cues to deception to make judgements. Misinformation and disinformation present both challenges and opportunities for individuals, businesses, and governments. Future work in immersive, 3D virtual worlds takes a naturalistic approach to understand the principal elements of cues to misinformation and disinformation.",
10.1080/02699931.2014.887000,prime time news: the influence of primed positive and negative emotion on susceptibility to false memories,"We examined the relation between emotion and susceptibility to misinformation using a novel paradigm, the ambiguous stimuli affective priming (ASAP) paradigm. Participants (N = 88) viewed ambiguous neutral images primed either at encoding or retrieval to be interpreted as either highly positive or negative (or neutral/not primed). After viewing the images, they either were asked misleading or non-leading questions. Following a delay, memory accuracy for the original images was assessed. Results indicated that any emotional priming at encoding led to a higher susceptibility to misinformation relative to priming at recall. In particular, inducing a negative interpretation of the image at encoding led to an increased susceptibility of false memories for major misinformation (an entire object not actually present in the scene). In contrast, this pattern was reversed when priming was used at recall; a negative reinterpretation of the image decreased memory distortion relative to unprimed images. These findings suggest that, with precise experimental control, the experience of emotion at event encoding, in particular, is implicated in false memory susceptibility. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",
10.1007/978-94-007-6527-6_29,"life, drugs, and the making of meaning","Drug use can seem an odd and inexplicable act but might be part of a larger quest to make meaning in life. This chapter places this quest within the context of recent psychological theorizing related to the Meaning Maintenance Model (Proulx and Heine, Psychol Inq, 17:309-318, 2006). This model suggests that threats to one's sense of meaning motivate compensatory efforts to create an environment that appears meaningful-especially by changing the world, one's perceptions of it, or one's beliefs. We suggest that societal teachings about drugs are often at odds with individual experiences, essentially threatening meaning. This threat then encourages further inquiry about drugs, potentially increasing use or motivating questions about societal teachings. A review of recent empirical support for the Meaning Maintenance Model leads to novel predictions about the potential effects of misinformation about drug use motives and behavior. This information might inadvertently motivate drug experiences, altering expectancies and contributing to use. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. All rights reserved.",

10.1177/0142723715609229,the effects of source unreliability on prior and future word learning,"Young children regularly learn words from interactions with other speakers, though not all speakers are reliable informants. Interestingly, children will reverse to trusting a reliable speaker when a previously endorsed speaker proves unreliable. When later asked to identify the referent of a novel word, children who reverse trust are less willing to consider previously mislabeled objects. The current studies report two related findings. When later asked to identify the label of a novel object, children who reverse trust are less willing to consider previously misused words. When later asked to identify the referent of a novel word, children who reverse trust are less willing to endorse the testimony of the initially trusted but unreliable speaker - even when judged against a stranger. Overall, these findings suggest reversing trust has residual effects for elements involved in the original acquisition of misinformation (e.g. the mislabeled object, misused word, and originally trusted speaker), and these effects could undermine later word-learning efforts. Accounts of children who continue endorsing an unreliable speaker despite opposing testimony from a reliable speaker are also considered. © The Author(s) 2015.",

10.1146/annurev.psych.093008.100455,a bridge over troubled water: reconsolidation as a link between cognitive and neuroscientific memory research traditions,"There are two research traditions on dynamic memory processes. In cognitive psychology, the malleable nature of long-term memory has been extensively documented. Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hand, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

Specifically, participants who had taken an initial test about a witnessed event were more likely than nontested participants to recall subsequently encountered misinformation-an effect we called retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES). Here, we sought to test the generality of RES and to further elucidate its underlying mechanisms. To that end, we tested a dual mechanism account, which suggests that RES occurs because initial testing (a) enhances learning of the later misinformation by reducing proactive interference and (b) causes the reactivated memory trace to be more susceptible to later interference (i.e., a reconsolidation account). Three major findings emerged. First, RES was found after a 1-week delay, where a robust testing benefit occurred for event details that were not contradicted by later misinformation. Second, blockage of reconsolidation was unnecessary for RES to occur. Third, initial testing enhanced learning of the misinformation even when proactive interference played a minimal role. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",
10.1002/etc.2817,european chemicals agency dossier submissions as an experimental data source: refinement of a fish toxicity model for predicting acute lc50 values,"As a result of the stringent data requirements of the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, a vast amount of ecotoxicological data has become available through the dissemination portal of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). As of April 2014, the database contained 12 439 unique substances from 47 909 dossiers. This vast database could be used to refine existing, or to create new, non-testing methods, such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). Acute fish toxicity data were mined from the ECHA database using the eChemPortal; after filtering for single organic substances, 1159 experimental data points remained, representing 564 compounds. To evaluate the quality and accessibility of this data, the authors used the data to refine and improve an existing QSAR. The reliability of the data submitted to the ECHA database, as well as the effectiveness of the Klimisch scoring system, were assessed by comparing the refined QSAR with established QSAR benchmarks. The model developed meets all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles, has strong internal (leave-one-out internally cross-validated correlation coefficient [Q2LOO]=0.91) and external (external coefficient of determination (predicted vs experimental [test set])) validation statistics, and can provide reliable fish median lethal concentration (LC50) predictions for non-polar narcotics. Although some issues with dossier misinformation were discovered, it was found that the ECHA dissemination portal is a valuable and reliable data source. When queried using the eChemPortal, chemical dossiers containing reliable data could be found quickly. The ECHA dissemination portal holds great potential for future QSAR development and improvement, such as updating QSARs within the Ecological Structure-Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) program. © 2014 SETAC.",
10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.02.035,attitudes toward vaccination and the h1n1 vaccine: poor people's unfounded fears or legitimate concerns of the elite?,"In 2009-2010, the H1N1 episode occurred in a general context of decreasing public confidence in vaccination. We assumed opposition to vaccination in general to be an 'unfounded fear', reflecting ignorance and perceived vulnerability among low-socioeconomic status (SES) people, and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine a 'legitimate concern' reflecting the elite's commitment to 'risk culture' in a 'risk society'. We indirectly tested these assumptions by investigating the socioeconomic profiles associated with opposition to vaccination in general and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine specifically. Our second aim was to determine whether or not opposition to the H1N1 vaccine fuelled opposition to vaccination in general. We used data from a telephone survey conducted in 2009-2010 among a random sample of French people aged 15-79 (N=9480). Attitudes toward vaccination in general and toward the H1N1 vaccine specifically varied significantly between October 2009 and June 2010 with strong correlation being observed between these attitudes throughout the whole period. In multivariable analysis attitudes toward vaccination in general remained a significant predictor of attitudes to the H1N1 vaccine and vice versa, for distinct profiles as follows: males, older people, low-SES people for opposition to vaccination in general, versus females, people aged 35-49 and those with an intermediate SES for opposition to the H1N1 vaccine. Results also differed regarding indicators of social vulnerability, proximity to preventive medicine and vaccination history. The first profile supported the ""unfounded fears expressed by low-SES people"" hypothesis, while the second echoed previous work related to middle-classes' ""healthism"". Opposition to vaccination should not be reduced to irrational reactions reflecting ignorance or misinformation and further research is needed to acquire a greater understanding of the motives of opponents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",
10.1016/j.actpsy.2011.12.004,"repetition, not number of sources, increases both susceptibility to misinformation and confidence in the accuracy of eyewitnesses","Are claims more credible when made by multiple sources, or is it the repetition of claims that matters? Some research suggests that claims have more credibility when independent sources make them. Yet, other research suggests that simply repeating information makes it more accessible and encourages reliance on automatic processes-factors known to change people's judgments. In Experiment 1, people took part in a ""misinformation"" study: people first watched a video of a crime and later read eyewitness reports attributed to one or three different eyewitnesses who made misleading claims in either one report or repeated the same misleading claims across all three reports. In Experiment 2, people who had not seen any videos read those same reports and indicated how confident they were that each claim happened in the original event. People were more misled by-and more confident about-claims that were repeated, regardless of how many eyewitnesses made them. We hypothesize that people interpreted the familiarity of repeated claims as markers of accuracy. These findings fit with research showing that repeating information makes it seem more true, and highlight the power of a single repeated voice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0134739,"blame conformity: innocent bystanders can be blamed for a crime as a result of misinformation from a young, but not elderly, adult co-witness","This study examined whether or not exposing an eyewitness to a co-witness statement that incorrectly blames an innocent bystander for a crime can increase the likelihood of the eyewitness subsequently blaming the innocent bystander for the crime. It also examined whether or not the perceived age of the co-witness influences this effect. Participant eyewitnesses first watched a video of a crime featuring a perpetrator and an innocent bystander. They then read one of six bogus co-witness statements about the crime. All were presented as having been written by a female co-witness and they differed in terms of her age (young adult or elderly) and who she blamed for the crime (the perpetrator, the innocent bystander, or nobody). One week later the participants were asked who committed the crime. When the young adult co-witness had blamed the innocent bystander just over 40% of participants subsequently did the same. Few participants (less than 8%) in the other conditions subsequently blamed the innocent bystander. The elderly co-witness was also rated as less credible, less competent, and less accurate than the younger co-witness suggesting eyewitnesses were less likely to be influenced by her incorrect statement as they perceived her to be a less reliable source of information. The applied implications of these findings are discussed. Copyright: © 2015 Craig Thorley.",
10.1017/CBO9780511676345.008,evolution and creationism in the islamic world,"In the Muslim world Islam and modern science are often seen as compatible. It is common for people to cite verses in the Qur'an or the achievements of medieval Muslim philosophers to support this view. Furthermore, there is widespread recognition that science (usually in its applied form) is essential for progress. In fact the dominant narrative in the Muslim world sees Islam as a rational religion in harmony with modern science. At the same time many Muslims see the theory of biological evolution as a challenge to the Islamic account of creation. Thus, when a well-established scientific idea, such as biological evolution, clashes with the religious beliefs of many Muslims, we find complex reactions, ranging from selectively rejecting the relevant science to ignoring the troublesome idea, without harming the outwardly harmonious framework. It is quite possible, nonetheless, that the Muslim world will become the focal point of evolution–creation controversies in the coming years. Low educational standards in combination with widespread misinformation about evolutionary ideas make many countries in the Muslim world fertile ground for anti-evolutionary movements. In addition there already exists a growing and highly influential Islamic creationist movement, which made headlines in Europe in 2007 when French public schools received an unsolicited gift of an 850-page colour Atlas of creation, produced by a Muslim creationist from Turkey known by the name of Harun Yahya. Biological evolution, however, is still a relatively new concept for the majority of Muslims, and a serious debate over its compatibility with religion has not yet taken place. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",
10.1016/j.cogdev.2013.01.012,effects of mothers' conversation style and receipt of misinformation on children's event reports,"Can memory sharing conversations with mothers lead to errors in children's event memory when mothers are exposed to misinformation about what their children experienced and does this effect vary as a function of maternal memory-sharing style? Mothers were exposed to a false suggestion about a non-shared event and then discussed that event with their children. When later interviewed, those children whose mothers were provided this misinformation were likely to wrongly report experiencing activities consistent with the maternal suggestion and embellish their reports of these activities with elaborative detail. Moreover, children whose mothers spoke in a highly elaborative manner were more likely to recall occurrences in line with the maternal suggestion and provided more fictitious narrative detail describing non-occurring-but-suggested information than did children whose mothers used a less elaborative style. These findings suggest that when mothers hold false beliefs about a non-shared event, an elaborative maternal style is associated with an increase in children's false reports reflecting maternal beliefs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Participants were shown video footage of an armed robbery. Approximately 30minutes later, they were asked to describe as accurately as possible what they had seen. Either 1 day or 2 weeks later they were presented with their own statements, to which five misinformation items had been added. The results showed that people suffering from memory distrust accepted more misinformation than those with optimistic beliefs about their memory. In addition, both age and free recall seemed to modulate this relationship. However, memory evaluation did not interact with time interval. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

On 8 February, 'whale shark' was the third most searched keyword as shown on Google Trends. Reports on landmark events such as this could educate the public on marine conservation issues. We collated 45 internet news reports and examined whether or not reports a) are scientifically accurate for information on the species in question and b) educate readers on specific or broad biology or conservation issues. We found only 46.6% of the reports to be factually accurate. Only a minority of the reports discussed conservation of whale sharks.

10.1002/acp.3024,partner characteristics and social contagion: does group composition matter?,"People's incorrect recalls can contaminate their collaborators' performance on subsequent tasks, referred to as the social contagion of memory. Research investigating how expectations about group members' abilities and affiliations relate to such contagion has given little attention to the mechanisms underlying any differential reliance on collaborators' contributions. In two experiments, we investigated whether expectations about a collaborative partner influence social contagion and whether source monitoring was related to any differential reliance. Contagion was reduced, for both accurate and inaccurate information, when participants worked with a partner perceived to be of low as compared with high credibility. Participants also showed reduced contagion after working with an out-group as compared with an in-group partner. These findings indicate that partner characteristics influence whether the information generated during a collaborative task is encoded and/or relied upon later. Expectations about potentially problematic sources can motivate resistance to misinformation through careful monitoring of partner contributions. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
10.1080/01402390.2010.498262,cover for thor: divine deception planning for cold war missiles,"In the late 1950s, as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) replaced bombers, the development of Soviet ICBMs prompted fears of strategic vulnerability in the West. The Eisenhower administration's decision to deploy Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) on the territory of NATO allies sought to redress the perceived vulnerability until American ICBMs were ready. British deception planners considered how to enhance the threat posed by the IRBMs. An outline plan codenamed 'Celestial' was intended to persuade the Soviets that the otherwise vulnerable missiles could not be readily neutralised. This article explores this deception and how such planning also sought to convey accurate information alongside disinformation. It also suggests that deception planners appear to have given little heed to the potentially counterproductive consequences of such an operation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",
10.1177/2158244014547875,developing a global cancer stigma index,"Despite increasing recognition about the stigma associated with cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment-seeking behaviors, there has been relatively little attention paid to how to assess and intervene to reduce that stigma. An index to measure cancer stigma could empower health program developers and policymakers by identifying the key areas in which a population could benefit from education to change perceptions and address misinformation. The index also could be used to rank countries and communities based on their level of cancer stigma to assess where interventions are needed. We used structured literature review and expert review to generate a cancer stigma item pool. The item pool was subject to cognitive interviews for cultural appropriateness and comprehension; and data from initial pilot testing were used to reduce the pool of items for translation and field testing. The field test was conducted using a web-based survey in four samples representing two regions and three languages—English and Arabic speakers in Jordan and Egypt, and English and Mandarin Chinese speakers in China. Factor analyses and item response theory were applied to finalize the index. The analyses resulted in a 12-item cancer stigma index (CSI) that was reliable across all four samples. The CSI scores were highly correlated with a general illness stigma scale, and operated as expected noting higher cancer stigma among men and those with lower income. The CSI can be used to inform initial cancer education efforts, identifying overall stigma levels in a country or community and particular issue areas requiring intervention. © The Author(s) 2014.",
NA,grammatical errors in spoken english of university students in oral communication course,"The present study examines the grammatical errors in spoken English of university students who are less proficient in English. The specific objectives of the study are to determine the types of errors and the changes in grammatical accuracy during the duration of the English for Social Purposes course focussing on oral communication. The language data were obtained from the simulated oral interactions of 42 students participating in five role play situations during the 14-week semester. Error analysis of 126 oral interactions showed that the five common grammar errors made by the learners are preposition, question, article, plural form of nouns, subject-verb agreement and tense. Based on Dulay, Burt and Krashen's (1982) surface structure taxonomy, the main ways by which students modify the target forms are misinformation and omission, with addition of elements or misordering being less frequent. The results also showed an increase in grammatical accuracy in the students' spoken English towards the end of the course.",

Preschool children (N = 24) were interviewed about a game they had played. One third of them spontaneously reported the truth, one third lied in response to coaching and one third spontaneously reported misinformation from a prior misleading suggestive interview. One hundred and twenty-nine college students watched videotaped interviews of these children describing their alleged play activities and assessed their credibility. Children who had experienced misleading suggestive questioning were rated as less credible than those who were telling the truth and those who were lying.

10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.11.007,disowned recollections: denying true experiences undermines belief in occurrence but not judgments of remembering,"Recent research findings have illustrated that false memories induced in the laboratory can be dissociated from the beliefs that the events had in fact occurred. In this study we assessed whether this dissociability is a quality peculiar to false memory, or whether it represents a general characteristic of autobiographical memory. To this end we examined whether people can be induced to stop believing in memories for true experiences. Participants observed and performed simple actions, and were later falsely informed that they had not performed some of them-that false memories for these actions had been implanted through the use of fabricated evidence. Before and after receiving this misinformation, participants rated their belief in and memory of performing those actions, other actions that they had also performed, and actions that they had not performed. Whereas the misinformation substantially undermined participants' beliefs in the specific performed actions about which they had been misinformed, it had little effect on their endorsement of remembering those actions. The misinformation thus boosted the proportion of occasions in which participants rated their memories as stronger than their beliefs, and it weakened the correlation between belief and memory ratings. Thus, this study provides the first experimental demonstration of non-believed memories of true experiences. We discuss our findings with reference to the small literature concerning the use of socially-communicated misinformation to undermine event memories, and with reference to the structure of autobiographical memory. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",
10.1080/20445911.2013.769440,the effect of mood on confidence in false memories,"The goal of this study was to examine the effect of mood on suggestibility in the misinformation paradigm. To investigate the relative effects of valence and arousal, as well as affect-specific influences, six mood conditions were included: positive mood with low/high arousal (serene/happy), negative mood with low/high arousal (sad/angry), neutral mood, and a control condition. Participants watched a movie and were exposed to misleading information by means of a narrative. Memory was tested in a surprise forced-choice recognition task, with confidence judgements. The mood induction procedure was shown to be effective. A significant misinformation effect confirmed that participants were misled by the false information provided. Mood did not affect susceptibility to the misinformation effect, but did significantly influence participants belief in their false memories. Feeling sad induced the highest confidence ratings. Results are discussed in terms of different problem-solving strategies associated with discrete affective states, and have implications for both legal and clinical settings. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.08.004,the effects of conformity on recognition judgements for emotional stimuli,"Exposure to another's account of a shared event can influence the content of an individual's memory report. We examine whether the emotionality of the to-be-remembered information influences the likelihood that socially encountered post-event information is accepted into memory. Participants were exposed to positive, negative or neutral emotional pictures. Subsequently, they had to discriminate these pictures from new pictures in a 'yes/no' recognition decision either before or subsequent to a confederate providing misinformation, accurate or no information. Post-event information influenced participants' responding in the recognition test. Effects were larger for participants viewing neutral items and persisted for these items on a subsequent private source monitoring test. These findings indicate that people rely more on information from others when encountering non-emotional compared to emotional items. We suggest that increased memory strength in conjunction with access to strong retrieval cues in the recognition test serves to shield emotional items from vulnerability to effects of memory conformity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Afterward, participants viewed another film clip that was either arousing or neutral. One week later, the arousal group recognized significantly more veridical details and endorsed significantly fewer misinformation items than the neutral group.

10.1037/xge0000127,the malleability of developmental trends in neutral and negative memory illusions,"Among many legal professionals and memory researchers there exists the assumption that susceptibility to false memory decreases with age. In 4 misinformation experiments, we show that under conditions that focus on the meaning of experiences, children are not always the most susceptible to suggestion-induced false memories. We begin by presenting a short overview of previous developmental false memory studies, the majority of which have found that the susceptibility to misinformation decreases with age. In Experiment 1, 6/7-year-olds, 11/12-year-olds, and adults received a video and were confronted with misinformation about related but nonpresented details. Older children and adults had higher misinformation acceptance rates than younger children. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding adding a younger child group (4/6-year-olds). In Experiments 3 and 4, we used new material and again found that susceptibility to misinformation increased with age. Together, these experiments show that children's memory accuracy is not necessarily inferior to that of adults'. © 2016 The Author(s).",

10.1080/2154896X.2015.1040257,overcoming challenges to communicating antarctic climate science,"The output of current Antarctic climate science is compelling and highlights the global teleconnections of the climate system. However, these findings are as yet failing to resonate with and promote the need for mitigation action among the general public and policymakers in many countries, inhibiting the establishment of concerted global action to combat the escalation of climate change. Subsequently, there is a need to re-evaluate how the general public interprets and understands the complex issues surrounding climate change generally and the impacts of climate change on Antarctica more specifically. Barriers to garnering public support for action are numerous and diverse, from the individual’s worldview, cognitive reinforcement and religious beliefs to the misreporting and miscommunication of climate science by the media, as well as the influence of vested interests. In order to combat misinformation and to familiarise the general public with the value of Antarctic science and the importance of research output in guiding climate policy formation, substantial efforts must be made in education, outreach and communication (EOC) strategies. We suggest that the establishment of an Antarctic Climate Education, Outreach and Communication Standing Committee as a part of the highly respected Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research could provide the foundation for boundary work at the interface of climate science and policy, in which EOC strategies are strongly integrated and valued. By raising awareness and increasing public understanding of the complex issues and interactions of Antarctica and the global climate system, the scientific community can better channel the importance of action to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions to prevent catastrophic climate change and potentially provide the catalyst required for substantial climate change action. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",
10.1111/jcom.12164,"emotions, partisanship, and misperceptions: how anger and anxiety moderate the effect of partisan bias on susceptibility to political misinformation","Citizens are frequently misinformed about political issues and candidates but the circumstances under which inaccurate beliefs emerge are not fully understood. This experimental study demonstrates that the independent experience of two emotions, anger and anxiety, in part determines whether citizens consider misinformation in a partisan or open-minded fashion. Anger encourages partisan, motivated evaluation of uncorrected misinformation that results in beliefs consistent with the supported political party, while anxiety at times promotes initial beliefs based less on partisanship and more on the information environment. However, exposure to corrections improves belief accuracy, regardless of emotion or partisanship. The results indicate that the unique experience of anger and anxiety can affect the accuracy of political beliefs by strengthening or attenuating the influence of partisanship. © 2015 International Communication Association.",
10.1016/j.cognition.2012.07.009,undoing suggestive influence on memory: the reversibility of the eyewitness misinformation effect,"Presenting inconsistent postevent information about a witnessed incident typically decreases the accuracy of memory reports concerning that event (the misinformation effect). Surprisingly, the reversibility of the effect (after an initial occurrence) has remained largely unexplored. Based on a memory conversion theoretical framework and associated refined assessment strategy, we report three experiments to demonstrate that suggestive influence can be completely undone. Initially established misinformation effects were eliminated - even after a period of 5. weeks (Exp. 3) - through (a) an enlightenment procedure ensuring an adequate representation of the memory task as a search for potentially two contradictory items (instead of ""the"" single ""correct"" answer) and (b) using a memory state test that unconfounds the performance contributions of item and source memory by assessing them separately. Specifically, memory for original event details that were the target of misinformation was restored to the level of non-misled control performance, and even beyond (Exp. 3). This remarkable reversibility of misinformation influence highlights the central role of memory conversion processes in the misinformation effect (but does not principally exclude the contribution of traditional interference processes). We discuss the compatibility of our findings with previous research and make suggestions for real-world eyewitness interrogation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",

We examined the impact of four different types of misleading questions commonly used in interviews. These questions varied in their specificity, presumptive knowledge and structure (open or closed). Forty-one adults with a mild ID watched a short film; they were then interviewed about what had happened. Half of the questions contained misleading information. In a later recognition test, participants showed a misinformation effect: they correctly recognised more items about which they had received control information than the items about which they had received misleading information. Closer inspection of the data revealed that both closed and open presumptive questions generated the largest misinformation effects. These findings highlight the vulnerability of adults with an ID to misleading questions, specifically those that presume certain information to be true. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

After viewing a highly positive and highly negative photographic image, half of participants (N = 80) were exposed to misinformation concerning the images and later responded to a series of questions about the details of each. After 1 week or 1 month, participants returned and were asked (unexpectedly) about the images. Overall, memories of misled participants were substantially less accurate than nonmisled participants, a pattern persisting at 1-week and 1-month follow-up, although the passage of time decreased accuracy of all participants. Relative to positive images, negative images were associated with a greater susceptibility to false memories for a major misleading detail at both sessions. Thus, relative to positive emotion, negative emotion specifically heightens suggestibility in the presence of major misinformation. © 2010 Canadian Psychological Association.",

Now users are acquiring information from the internet and using it to make important decisions. This method of acquisition is threatening the epistemological protection librarians have provided. The problem is one of verifiability, the users do not have a way to verify whether information is accurate or inaccurate. The verification is even more difficult with disinformation. The purpose of this paper is to explore possible alternatives to this problem and recommend using a new multi-literacy instructional method as the solution. Design/methodology/approach: A review of current literature confirmed the problem of disinformation and this paper examines possible solutions to controlling disinformation and makes suggestions on how we, as librarians, can use instruction to protect internet users from the harmful effects of using the false information. Findings: Research found that disinformation is a widespread problem and its use has epistemic consequences that are harmful to internet users. The paper proposes a new method of instruction using a combination of learning paradigms to help users protect themselves from disinformation. Originality/value: The paper presents a new instructional method that may help in identifying disinformation and help internet users avoid the bad epistemic consequences of using disinformation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

Two years later the procedure was repeated with a different story for 31 of the children. Although 4-year-olds overtly disagreed more times than the older children did when misinformation was initially presented, this resistance did not affect their accuracy or suggestibility scores.

The paper was the first to extend 'misinformation' effects established in controlled laboratory settings to witness reports following discussions with fellow witnesses. This was achieved within a relatively naturalistic situation and it persuasively demonstrated what had long been observed in the social psychological literature: that the opinions of others affect our behaviour but can also quite dramatically alter our reports as well as our beliefs and memories. When eyewitnesses comply with the reports of others in a social interaction, the longterm consequences for their recollections are clearly substantial. This paper has stimulated much research which has reinforced and extended the basic findings. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
10.1029/2012WR012181,could electrical conductivity replace water level in rating curves for alpine streams?,"Streamflow time series are important for inference and understanding of the hydrological processes in alpine watersheds. Because streamflow is expensive to continuously measure directly, it is usually derived from measured water levels, using a rating curve modeling the stage-discharge relationship. In alpine streams, this practice is complicated by the fact that the streambed constantly changes due to erosion and sedimentation by the turbulent mountain streams. This makes the stage-discharge relationship dynamic, requiring frequent discharge gaugings to have reliable streamflow estimates. During an ongoing field study in the Val Ferret watershed in the Swiss Alps, 93 streamflow values were measured in the period 2009-2011 using salt dilution gauging with the gulp injection method. The natural background electrical conductivity in the stream, which was measured as by-product of these gaugings, was shown to be a strong predictor for the streamflow, even marginally outperforming water level. Analysis of the residuals of both predictive relations revealed errors in the gauged streamflows. These could be corrected by filtering disinformation from erroneous calibration coefficients. In total, extracting information from the auxiliary data enabled to reduce the uncertainty in the rating curve, as measured by the root-mean-square error in log-transformed streamflow relative to that of the original stage-discharge relationship, by 43.7%. © 2013.

Before the 9/11 attack, the American intelligence system was always ambivalent towards intelligence material derived from open sources including media, journals, and other publicly available sources. However, in the wake of the September 11 bombing, OSINT found a new appreciation on the part of legislators and intelligence managers. This newfound interest on open sources resulted in the creation of a new office dedicated to Open Source which is under the direction of the Director of National Intelligence and which is managed by the CIA. Although in previous years, OSINT was seen as unnecessary to national intelligence due to the tendency of the low reliability of sources arising from the misinformation, secret messages, disinformation, and nonsense content of OSINT sources, the OSINT when properly used is believed to be as crucial as the most secretive and expensive aspects of intelligence collection. Together with other forms of intelligence collection, OSINT provides information about adversaries and enemies. Properly interpreted, OSINT can be just as enlightening as a wellinformed secret agent, or an image from an unmanned spy aircraft. In the end, what is most significant is the system'S ability to give sound judgments to decision makers. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc. All rights reserved.",
10.1371/journal.pone.0118093,science vs conspiracy: collective narratives in the age of misinformation,"The large availability of user provided contents on online social media facilitates people aggregation around shared beliefs, interests, worldviews and narratives. In spite of the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called collective intelligence unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories - e.g., chemtrails, reptilians or the Illuminati - are pervasive in online social networks (OSN). In this work we study, on a sample of 1.2 million of individuals, how information related to very distinct narratives-i.e. main stream scientific and conspiracy news - are consumed and shape communities on Facebook. Our results show that polarized communities emerge around distinct types of contents and usual consumers of conspiracy news result to be more focused and self-contained on their specific contents. To test potential biases induced by the continued exposure to unsubstantiated rumors on users' content selection, we conclude our analysis measuring how users respond to 4,709 troll information - i.e. parodistic and sarcastic imitation of conspiracy theories. We find that 77.92% of likes and 80.86% of comments are from users usually interacting with conspiracy stories. © 2015 Bessi et al.",

However, such investigations treat incorrect answers to quiz questions measuring knowledge as evidence of misinformation. This study instead defines misperceptions as incorrect answers that respondents are confident are correct. Two surveys of representative samples of American adults on the Affordable Care Act reveal that most people were uncertain about the provisions in the law. Confidently held incorrect beliefs were far less common than incorrect answers. Misperceptions were most prevalent on aspects of the law on which elites prominently and persistently made incorrect claims. Furthermore, although Americans appear to have learned about the law between 2010 and 2012, misperceptions on many provisions of the law persisted. © 2015 International Communication Association.",

While, not all emergency situations are of the same scale, they have a number of things in common. This chapter describes the impact that emergencies can have on people and organizations; the emergency management principles; the importance of hazard identification, vulnerability analysis, and risk assessment; and the role of communication in coordination and collaboration among emergency responders. Various types of emergencies include medical events and accidents, fires and evacuations, shelter in place and lockdown incidents, bomb threats and suspicious packages, disasters, and terrorist actions. These and many other types of emergency situations can happen to any organization at any time. Hazard identification, risk assessment, and impact analysis are important steps in the planning process, because many of the key decisions made relative to the emergency plan are based on this information. Procedures for dealing with the media are another important area that cannot be overlooked; however, being prepared ahead of time to deal with the media can help an organization get through the incident without the additional damage that can be caused by misinformation and speculation. An effective emergency response plan involves four important components: planning, reviewing, training, and testing. The professional protection officer must be prepared to respond to such events in accordance with his or her organizational protocols, training, and, most important, good judgment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

10.1371/journal.pone.0094093,rising tides or rising stars?: dynamics of shared attention on twitter during media events,"""Media events"" generate conditions of shared attention as many users simultaneously tune in with the dual screens of broadcast and social media to view and participate. We examine how collective patterns of user behavior under conditions of shared attention are distinct from other ""bursts"" of activity like breaking news events. Using 290 million tweets from a panel of 193,532 politically active Twitter users, we compare features of their behavior during eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election to examine how patterns of social media use change during these media events compared to ""typical"" time and whether these changes are attributable to shifts in the behavior of the population as a whole or shifts from particular segments such as elites. Compared to baseline time periods, our findings reveal that media events not only generate large volumes of tweets, but they are also associated with (1) substantial declines in interpersonal communication, (2) more highly concentrated attention by replying to and retweeting particular users, and (3) elite users predominantly benefiting from this attention. These findings empirically demonstrate how bursts of activity on Twitter during media events significantly alter underlying social processes of interpersonal communication and social interaction. Because the behavior of large populations within socio-technical systems can change so dramatically, our findings suggest the need for further research about how social media responses to media events can be used to support collective sensemaking, to promote informed deliberation, and to remain resilient in the face of misinformation. © 2014 Lin et al.",
10.1080/13183222.2014.11009136,the dilemma of group membership in the internet age: public knowledge as preferred misinformation,"A commonly accepted assumption is that scientific knowledge on the part of the general public would increase in an era of increasing ease of access to all forms of information. This argument suggests that the public only needs to take an advantage of an inexpensive laptop computer to be superbly informed. However, what appears to be the case is that the public appears to be more prone than ever to misinformation, partial truths, and ""spin"". Research shows that, even when it comes to scientific knowledge, we have socially-mediated preferences; we prefer those beliefs that we like and that are considered reasonable by our peers. Importantly, our ""peers"" can in our hyperlocal world be virtual or real. Thus, social group membership merges with our individual likes and dislikes to shape what we take as ""knowledge"". Groups, therefore, become platforms of social epistemologies. We examine our argument from the viewpoint of the United States using a large data set from the General Social Survey. We employ the 2008 topical module to examine the relationships between attitudes and knowledge concerning science and technology, the relationship between media use, demographic group variables, and group-related attitudes toward science.",

By analyzing children's television for its portrayal of race and ethnicity, this chapter will explore the role media play in children's understanding of people and cultures outside of their own. A textual analysis of episodes of Maya & Miguel, the chapter describes the depiction of several cultures found represented on the program including White, Asian, African, Dominican, and Mexican and how race, ethnicity, and culture is framed in the television program. Some theories suggest that television is a primary tool in the socialization of children. Children are attracted to the animation in cartoons, the colors, the movement and the easy-to-follow simplicity of the dialogue. Given the impressionable nature of children, it is possible that they begin to act out the biased nature of the cartoons they watch. Thus, considering their vulnerability, information literacy is relevant to discerning media messages. In this way, information literacy converges with media literacy and visual literacy. Guiding children to interrogate what they view is critically important especially when they are at an age where they can be easily influenced by misinformation or dominant messages. Additionally, the volume of information is steadily increasing in the 21st century as are the modes for accessing, creating and manipulating information. Thus, this work will demonstrate how promoting participatory learning by objectively viewing media and exercising reflective thinking will be important components of children's education in this millennium. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

To better understand the influence of co-witnesses we compared the influence of co-witness misinformation with the influence of misinformation provided by an interviewer. Across two experiments using the MORI paradigm we found no evidence that a co-witness is particularly influential relative to another social source of post-event misinformation. In fact, the source of the misinformation delivered by our interviewer was less likely to be correctly recalled than the source of the misinformation delivered by a co-witness. There was some evidence that misinformation delivered by both a co-witness and an interviewer has a stronger effect on witnesses' accuracy and confidence than misinformation obtained from either source alone. Finally, our results suggest that the opportunity to provide an early individual memory account might protect against the effect of subsequently-encountered co-witness misinformation. These results have important implications for the way that criminal investigations are conducted. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",

I argue that even denial formed in ignorance of the organised misinformation campaign often constitutes a kind of arrogance, but that it is quite possible to humbly doubt the climate change problem. In some cases denial flows from other more or less serious errors or vices, such as ignorance, sincere but mistaken belief, dishonesty or selfishness. Those who press the arrogance charge also risk being arrogant in doing so. Educators can do a number of things to promote greater humility about climate change, including providing experiences that increase people’s appreciation of their individual and general human limitations and improving their ability to distinguish credible from discreditable sources of scientific information and factual from normative dimensions of the climate change problem. © 2015 The White Horse Press.",
10.1016/j.acalib.2015.07.003,"why students share misinformation on social media: motivation, gender, and study-level differences","The increasing use of social media for information sharing has elevated the need for information literacy (IL) education to prepare students to be effective information creators and communicators. One concern is that students sometimes indiscriminately forward misinformation. Understanding the reasons behind misinformation sharing would help the development of IL intervention strategies. Guided by the Uses and Gratifications approach and rumor research, undergraduate and graduate students in Singapore were surveyed on why they share misinformation on social media. Gender and study-level differences were investigated. Over 60% of respondents had shared misinformation. The top reasons were related to the information's perceived characteristics, as well as self-expression and socializing. Accuracy and authoritativeness did not rank highly. Women had a higher prevalence of sharing and intention to share misinformation. Undergraduate and graduate students differed in their reasons for sharing misinformation. The former share (and intend to share) more misinformation than the latter, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because many of the reasons cited were social in nature, IL training should address the social motivations propelling such behavior. Social media systems may also develop features that encourage users to flag debunked postings and allow a correction to be displayed alongside the misinformation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",
10.3758/BF03193073,how eyewitnesses resist misinformation: social postwarnings and the monitoring of memory characteristics,"Previous findings have been equivocal as to whether the postevent misinformation effect on eyewitness memory is reduced by warnings presented after the misinformation (postwarnings). In the present research, social postwarnings, which characterize the postevent source as a low-credibility individual, diminished the misinformation effect in both cued recall and recognition tests. Discrediting the source as being either untrustworthy or incompetent was effective (Experiment 1). Also, postwarned participants rated reality characteristics of their memories more accurately than did participants receiving no or high-credibility information about the postevent source (Experiment 2). A social postwarning yielded the same results as an explicit source-monitoring appeal and led to longer response times for postevent items, relative to a no-warning condition (Experiments 3 and 4). The findings suggest that the reduced misinformation effect was due to more thorough monitoring of memory characteristics by postwarned participants, rather than to a stricter response criterion or to enhanced event memory.

NA,young adults' contraceptive practices: an investigation of influences.,"This study investigated young adults' contraceptive behaviors and attitudes through application of a comprehensive, theoretical framework. Specifically, a social-psychological approach to understanding preventive behaviors (e.g., contraceptive practices), was developed, incorporating the Health Belief Model and other factors, which offered a means for evaluating the extent to which contraceptive behaviors were influenced by individual and group characteristics. The study group consisted of 283 unmarried students at several schools who were, on average, 19 years of age. Results suggested that effective contraceptive behavior associated most strongly with respondents' perceiving relatively few barriers to their use of contraception, their maintenance of extensive interpersonal skills, and their regarding peer norms as consistent with effective contraceptive behavior. Findings also underlined a need for continuing education about sexuality and contraception. Dangerous misinformation prevailed regarding respondents' knowledge of areas that include anatomy, physiology, and appropriate use of effective contraceptive methods. Finally, results implied a need to consider broad behavioral, social, and interpersonal issues as they relate to young adults' effective contraceptive behavior. Future studies of contraceptive risk taking are encouraged to examine both individual and social factors affecting sexual and contraceptive practices if unplanned pregnancy is to be minimized, if not eliminated.; A social-psychological approach to understanding preventive behaviors was developed, incorporating the Health Belief Model and other factors, to offer a means for evaluating the extent to which contraceptive behaviors in young adults are influenced by individual and group characteristics. The study group consisted of 283 unmarried US college students, who, on the average, were 19 years of age. Dangerous misconceptions prevailed with regard to respondents' knowledge of areas including anatomy, physiology, and appropriate use of effective contraception. 68.2% of the sample said that they had experienced coitus. Of those reporting coital experience, 56.6% did not take adequate precautions to prevent pregnancy at the time of their 1st coitus. Among the sexually experienced, 76.9% reported use of specific methods deemed effective at last coitus. More than 60% underestimated pregnancy rates of adolescents, and approximately 43% agreed that ""pregnancy just isn't something that would happen to me or a sexual partner."" 85.1% agreed that dealing with an unplanned pregnancy would be painful, and 86.7% disagreed that contraception made coitus less enjoyable. 94.7% believed that males and females should share the responsibility for birth control. However, 72.5% of both sexes thought males should be responsible for birth control availability while, in a separate item, 88.3% felt it was the female's responsibility. Furthermore, 27.3% held the notion that females with accessible contraception would be deemed promiscuous. 52.4% agreed that coitus should be spontaneous, 40.8% also felt that birth control makes intercourse seem preplanned. Effective contraceptive behavior associated most strongly with respondents' perceiving relatively few barriers to use of contraception, maintenance of extensive interpersonal skills, and their regarding peer norms as consistent with effective contraceptive behavior.",
10.1007/BF00310181,misinformation and unexpected change: testing the development of epistemic-state attribution,"Children's ability to infer a person's ignorance and false belief was tested in two stories which differed as to the relative ease for making these inferences. In the Unexpected Change story ignorance could be directly inferred from the emphasized fact that the target character had not witnessed the change, while false belief required the additional inference that the character would assume that things would stay as they had been initially. In the Misinformation Story false belief was made directly accessible by the content of a false message, while ignorance was not directly indicated by absence of information. It needed to be inferred from the fact that the available information was misleading. Results from 3- and 4-year-old Austrian and English children showed that manipulation of inferential difficulty did not affect their ability to make epistemic state attribution. In both stories children found it easier to attribute ignorance than false belief. To integrate this finding in the larger developmental context we suggest that children younger than 4 years find it difficult to distinguish between knowledge and ignorance because they do not understand the role of informational access in the formation of knowledge and they fail in false-belief attribution because they do not understand that incompatible truth values can be assigned to propositions. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",

10.4324/9780203869390-20,military dimensions of the “people’s war”: insurgency and counter-insurgency in nepal,"Introduction As important as military capability, strategy and performance are in civil wars, the role of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Royal Nepal Army (RNA) during Nepal’s Maoist insurgency have rarely been thoroughly analyzed.2 This is to a certain extent due to the sensitivity of the sector and as a result reliable information is not publicly available. By definition, the sector’s many aspects are kept secret. A major source of information about the PLA and RNA and their activities are their public statements, and the documents they have made available and interviews with personnel, but such information may contain positive bias about their respective organizations, omission of certain facts and sometimes deliberate misinformation about the other side. Newspaper reports are another source of information, but except for a few investigative reports “the reliability of news reports is always in doubt as some sensationalize the issue and others become protagonists of conflict, and some even play an advocacy role” in Nepal (Dhruba Kumar 2006: 103), while reports filed based on short trips in dangerous zones may contain information that may not have been verified with multiple sources. However, in the absence of other reliable sources of information, there is not much choice except to use this available information to describe and analyze the two armies’ performances. Our recognition of potential biases in the available information, we believe, has allowed us to weed out positive biases and misinformation. Further, collaboration between two authors, one with extensive experience in another country’s army, including counter-insurgency activities, and the other in academia, has allowed us to interrogate the available information with experiential and academic bases of knowledge. Hence, even though this study should not be taken as definitive in all aspects, we believe that until more in-depth analyses come forth, the chapter will provide urgently needed analysis of an important topic. © 2010 Mahendra Lawoti and Anup K.

Participants (N = 90) were recruited for research focusing on ""emotional processing"" and were not informed that their memories were being investigated. Then, they viewed either a highly positive, neutral, or highly negative emotional scene (e.g., graphic fatal accident) from the International Affective Picture System (e.g., Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999). Half of participants were exposed to misleading questions - one of which included a major false suggestion (i.e., large animal in the scene). An hour later all participants were asked to recall the scene and asked 10 direct questions, five of which related to the misinformation provided earlier. Overall, misleading questions impaired recall accuracy by 37%. Further, negative emotion increased susceptibility to false memories for the major misinformation. Whereas 0% of non-misled participants in any condition recalled seeing the major false detail, misled participants in the negative condition recalled seeing the major false detail more often (80%) than those in the positive (40%) and neutral (40%) conditions.",

In the initial study, 70 subjects viewed an 18-minute simulated employment interview, evaluated the interviewee, and then provided group ratings using their own evaluations and two other evaluations containing misinformation (misled group) or no misinformation (control group). The results of this study revealed that misled subjects were quite accepting of the misinformation, and were highly confident that the misinformation was true. In a supplemental experimental condition, a separate group of 23 subjects was given the same misinformation as the misled group. However, this group was alerted to the fact that they had received some misinformation, prior to completing a recognition memory test. This misled-informed group exhibited the same degree of accuracy as the control group, suggesting that the misinformation effects observed for the original misled group were due to social influence, rather than memory interference or source-attribution errors. © 1995 Academic Press.",

Specifically, this study uses a grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to explore the communicative processes of misinformation concerning women's lived experiences in relation to the climacteric. Five emergent themes extracted from premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women's discourse are identified and described through qualitative data analysis. Findings suggest that due to a lack of consistent communication, women are generally either unknowledgeable or misinformed about menopause and its related issues. Inaccurate information concerning a health-related experience that all women undergo has negative implications for women, their practitioners, and society. Moreover, a clearer understanding of women's experiences concerning menopause may enhance communication in physician-patient interactions (PPIs).",

In the second experiment participants, in pairs, viewed an identical crime except that half saw an accomplice with the thief and half did not. Initial memories were very accurate, but after discussing the crime with the other person in the pair (who saw a slightly different sequence), most pairs conformed.

Later, some eyewitnesses received either positive or negative feedback about these memory reports, suggesting a cowitness's report agreed or disagreed with theirs or that they had better or worse memory accuracy than most cowitnesses. Feedback influenced a number of subsequent memory-related responses. Witnesses who had received positive (vs. no) memory feedback later evinced heightened suggestibility in terms of accepting misinformation embedded in a memory interview and made identifications more confidently, quickly, and (in one condition) accurately. Witnesses who had received negative memory feedback evinced heightened suggestibility, made identifications less confidently, and recalled the witnessing and identification experience as involving poorer conditions for memory. Feedback appears to influence the overall self-credibility of memory, thereby altering confidence in both the feedback-specific memory and other aspects of memory for the event.

10.1002/acp.1145,evidence of metacognitive awareness in young children who have experienced a repeated event,"Two studies examined children's confidence judgments in the accuracy of their memories after repeated experience of an event. Children aged 5 to 6 years took part in an event once or four times, were provided with misinformation either shortly after (Study 1) or a while after (Study 2), and interviewed with yes/no recognition questions 3 months later. Children in the repeated-experience conditions were highly confident of their accurate responses to questions about items that were identical rather than variable across occurrences, and this discrimination was best at the shorter delay. The results show that children were able to metacognitively monitor the accuracy of their responses to qualitatively different kinds of details, and indicate that age is not the only determinant of metacognitive awareness after being misled. Rather, the nature of event representations must also be considered. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Using this case study, the relationship between the production of information about environmental problems and external institutions which address them, is examined. To see how certain analyses of change have gained credence and validity, while others ‐ including local people's own ‐ have been excluded from investigation, the relative dominance of particular disciplines, of methods and data sets within them, and of deductive theories guiding data interpretation, are considered.

This effect is especially pronounced for young children. For adults, the credibility of the source of the misleading information moderates this effect; misinformation presented by a credible source impairs performance to a greater degree than does misinformation presented by a noncredible source. In the present experiment, preschool children listened to a story accompanied by several illustrations. Later, they watched a videotape of a child, a credible adult, or a discredited adult answering questions about the story. For some children, the person in the videotape provided misleading information. The children's memory reports were impaired only when misinformation was presented by the credible adult, indicating that even young children are sensitive to source credibility cues. © 1995 American Psychological Association.",
NA,"reproductive and contraceptive knowledge, contraceptive self-efficacy, and contraceptive behavior among teenage women.","This research utilizes a social learning theory perspective to investigate the relationships among teenage women's Contraceptive Self-Efficacy (CSE), reproductive and contraceptive knowledge (RCK), and contraceptive behavior. It was posited that CSE might influence the way knowledge translates into behavior because individuals who feel they can and should use contraceptives may be more receptive to information. A secondary line of analysis examined the individual responses on the RCK to ascertain common knowledge and myths. The 521 respondents were from two diverse samples of teenage women attending family planning clinics. Although no significant relationships were found between RCK and behavior, the four-factor model of CSE explained 12% and 28% of the variance in RCK in the two samples. Results on the RCK items revealed sample differences and common areas of misinformation that are critical to effective contraceptive and prophylactic use. The findings are used to identify measurement issues that may account for the inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between RCK and behavior, and to recommend content for educational interventions.; A study of the relationships among adolescent females' contraceptive self-efficacy, contraceptive usage, and reproductive and contraceptive knowledge produced findings relevant to the content of sex education programs. Participants included 258 family planning clinic clients from Sunnyvale, California, and 263 such clients from Chicago, Illinois; the average age of respondents was 17.6 years. About 20% of women in both samples were not using a contraceptive method. The mean contraceptive use score, on a scale from 1 (inefficacious contraception) to 4 (highly efficacious contraceptive use), was 2.3 for the California group and 2.6 for the Illinois women. The mean reproductive and contraceptive knowledge score, on a scale from 1 to 7, was 4.2 in the former and 3.1 in the latter sample. Multivariate regression analyses failed to reveal any significant interactions among postulated predictors of contraceptive behavior (knowledge, self-efficacy, education, age, pregnancy and abortion history). Contraceptive self-efficacy was significantly related to knowledge for the communication, physical acceptance, and prevention subscales but not for the control subscale. Overall, the four self-efficacy subscales explained 12% of the variance in contraceptive usage in the Illinois sample and 28% of the variance in the California sample. Of concern were the high percentages of adolescents in both samples who were misinformed about the time during the menstrual cycle when the risk of pregnancy is greatest, the relative reliability of the various contraceptive methods, and proper condom use techniques.

S., & Johnson, M. K. (1989). The eyewitness suggestibility effect and memory for source. Memory & Cognition, 17, 349-358]). The present study investigated whether source-monitoring plays a similar role in children's suggestibility. It also examined whether the accuracy of source judgements is dependent on the type of source task employed at test. After watching a film and listening to a misleading narrative, 3-4- and 6-7-year-olds (n = 116) were encouraged to attend to source memory at retrieval. This was achieved either via sequential ""question pairs"", which are typically used in children's source-monitoring research, or via a novel ""posting-box"" procedure, in which all source options were provided simultaneously. Performance elicited by each type of source task was compared with that evoked by old/new recognition procedures. Posting-box, but not question pair, source cues were effective at reducing the magnitude of the suggestibility effect, relative to that observed under recognition conditions. Furthermore, source question pairs provoked a bias to respond affirmatively for 3-4-year-olds. The findings imply that children's suggestibility may be partially explained by sub-optimal use of intact source information, which may be activated by age-appropriate strategies at retrieval. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

NA,collaborative recall reduces the effect of a misleading post event narrative,"Witnesses are susceptible to misinformation from various sources but collaborative recall can reduce the effects of self-generated misinformation (e.g. Ross, Spencer, Blatz, & Restorick, 2008). We investigated whether collaborative recall could reduce misinformation effects produced by a narrative description of the witnessed event. 175 college students viewed a video of a car accident before reading a narrative recap and completing a recall task individually or collaboratively. A 2 × 2 factorial ANOVA for independent groups revealed a misinformation effect, greater recall accuracy for collaborative pairs than individuals, and a reduction in the misinformation effect for collaborative pairs. Results are consistent with past research on the positive effect of collaborative recall and lead to additional questions about the persistence of this effect. © NAJP.",
NA,"the chicken and the scorpion: rumor, counternarratives, and the political uses of buddhism","In this chapter I analyze the meaning and content of rumors current in Burma at the beginning of the 1990s. Several years after its defeat in a general election, the military regime began to look to Buddhism as a form of moral legitimacy in order to retain political power. The period from 1990 until Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest in July 1995 was one of ascendancy for the military regime (Fink 2001:78). In conditions of military repression, opinions about the regime are likely to be expressed in rumor. Skidmore (2003a: 13) has pointed out that rumor in urban Burmese spaces has become a form of broader discourse. I propose that rumors constitute ""popular resistance"" under the strict control of speech censorship and that they decode the moral legitimacy of the regime by the folk rubric of lawkī pyinnya (lit. ""this-worldly knowledge""). Historically, a great many rumors regarding the successive military regimes1 have existed in the public sphere, a prevalent one being that former Gen. Ne Win's absorption in astrology was such that the economic fortunes of the country lay in the hands of fortunetellers during the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) period (1962-1988). These kinds of rumors have not, however, been regarded as reliable resources for research, especially in the fields of political science and economics. On the other hand, many anthropologists collect village rumors and use them as legitimate informant discourse.2 Such ethnography has largely been conducted in relatively small communities where rumors can be easily confirmed, and it is not difficult to identify those transmitting rumors. In urban areas, however, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know the origin and extent of a rumor. Rumor has been an object of study in sociology and as a form of urban folklore.3 Morin, for example, defines rumor as a false story. He bases his argument on an analysis of Jewish trafficking of women in New Orleans as a story without any real basis (Morin 1980). Kapferer defines rumor more broadly as ""the emergence and circulation in society of information which is not publicly confirmed by official sources or denied by them"" (Kapferer 1990:13). He denies that an absolute reality exists in any society, emphasizing instead that truth-value is not of primary import for rumors and that reality is essentially social and exists in the place where it obtains the greatest social consensus. In this sense the creation and dissemination of Burmese rumor is truly a social act, one in which reality is contested and daily remade in the public domain. The rumors examined here were collected in Rangoon in 1991-1992, when I was conducting research on the religious practices of gaing membership and belief. Gaing is a term referring to a group of people organized around a founder who is known as a weikza (see below). Street rumors were commonly being discussed not only within my group of informants but also by the people around them, and it became clear that rumor was playing an important role for urban people. I checked on the veracity and circulation of the rumors in the central Kamayut township where I lived, and in the Ye Kyaw ward of distant Mingala Taung Nyun township where I conducted research. I asked about these rumors among a diverse range of informants including civil servants, office workers, merchants, shopkeepers, publishers, and also among people regarded as having expertise in lawkī pyinnya. I did not discuss rumors that I had heard, but instead waited for my informants to volunteer specific rumors. Among the many topics of Burmese rumors, in this chapter I focus upon a significant and prevalent kind of counterpolitical rumor that combines resistance to the regime with ""traditional"" folk knowledge and techniques such as astrology, omens, and yadaya (a technique for manipulating the results of astrology or portents). These forms of knowledge and practice have been documented in previous Burmese studies and in the ethnographic record.4 Astrology is consistently mentioned in these rumors concerning political power, particularly those rumors involving members of the ruling military council. Folk knowledge such as astrology is included in the broad category of lawkī pyinnya in Burma, but very little attention has been paid to this category of knowledge. This is not owing to an omission by scholars but is rather a reflection of the fact that it is rarely spoken of in daily life. This said, however, in locales where Buddhist ideology is dominant, Burmese people admit to a particular distinction between the everyday reality of the mundane world (lawkī) and lawkottara, otherworldly or ""more Buddhist"" events and issues. When people engage in practices focused upon lawkī, that is, the affairs of this world, they do so on the assumption that it is not the same as, and exists in contrast with, Buddhist praxis, which is oriented toward otherworldly aims. In the remainder of this chapter, I explain the content of lawkī pyinnya (and the lawkī/lawkottara dichotomy) before turning to an analysis of the political rumors of the 1990s. The rumors I examine here centrally involve lawkī pyinnya, and they show how delicate resistance is encapsulated in this particular fusion of Burmese discourses. © 2005 University of Hawai'i Press.

10.1080/13825570802420909,counterfeit kulchur,"An education, said Ezra Pound (Guide to Kulchur, New York: New Directions, 1970, 52), consists in ""getting wise"" in the rawest and hardest boiled sense of that bit of argot. In American gangster dialect, circa 1930 getting wise means wising up to the way the world really works. To be educated in Pound's terms is to realize that the world is run by gangs, that power is a symbiosis of public government, organized crime and private wealth with deep connections to both (P. D. Scott, Deep Politics, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996, 74); that the legitimated overworld of politics, multi-national corporations and international finance is linked in myriad ways the underworld, a situation that remains unchanged today. Pound's importance, even his nobility, lies in his unremitting attempt to wise us up and to promote a benign underworld of artists as the true bearers of culture in a world increasingly dominated by criminal greed. That this attempt led him astray politically and morally there can be no doubt, but his allegiance to Mussolini, his eventual anti-Semitism and his steady course rightwards from the mid-1930s onward, should not blind us to what he saw as his mission, which was nothing less than to save what was salvageable from the wreckage of twentieth-century Europe. Necessarily then, Pound's great work, The Cantos, is both the secret history of the world and a utopian program relying throughout on information and beliefs outside the mainstream. As many readers have noted the poem has aspects of a muck-raking project and as such is invested in secret history. By necessity, this aspect of history in the poem is documented throughout by evidence culled from unofficial and in many cases apocryphal sources that compromise the integrity of his epic project. The most obvious of these are The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which enter the source field of the poem relatively late, in The Pisan Cantos, but this notorious forgery will not be discussed here. Rather, this essay connects Pound's concept of the great bass, which he articulates in Guide to Kulchur to Peter Dale Scott's thinking about deep politics and parapolitics - concepts that have a clear relevance to the idea of secret history. © 2008 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
NA,the suggestive impact of cognitive illusions on interactive information exchange processes on terrorism,"During recent decades, fear about terror acts has risen. This development was and is supported by the increasing vulnerability of industrial societies (e.g., due to nuclear power plants and terrorists' attacks, e.g., in the Far East or 9/11). These tendencies influenced not only political decisions but the course of everyday life as well. As those events are extreme and rare, the psychological consequences and processes involved are so far relatively unknown. We discuss a possible framework for explaining these new developments by feasible psychological theories. A suitable approach is the Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). According to CPT, rationality is defined in respect to subjective reference points rather than to general objective criteria. The possibilities of explaining and predicting different definitions of rationality by means of CPT are discussed. Other features of CPT relevant in this context are cognitive illusions like the representative heuristic and availability heuristic. These heuristics cause a subjective representation of events that is not appropriate according to rational criteria. Therefore, such biases explain why terror events appear to be a real harassment in everyday life even though they are statistically less likely to occur than other incidents (e.g., traffic accidents). We also discuss the possibility of explaining the psychological processing of information dealing with terror threats by other phenomena known in the psychology of heuristics, biases and errors that are not explicitly addressed in CPT. These are the so-called validity, misinformation and labeling effects, illusionary correlations and the peculiarities involved when flashbulb memories are processed. Finally, the subject area of the psychology of suggestion will be addressed as a possible framework for these theories, heuristics and effects. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is argued that the rigorous questioning of–and hence, confrontation with–dominant beliefs, perceptions, norms, standards, and rules embedded in a neo-liberal, corporate-aligned ‘democratic’ global order will, by its very nature, contribute to the demise of human misfortune and injustice. As a viable start, cultural studies should return to the basically moral project of inquiry into injustice, oppression, and deception, and concretely undertake to have global influence in a world that has fewer and fewer margins separating truth from myth. The so-called ‘industry of deception’ has stringently endeavoured, and continues to endeavour, to thwart the political awakening of Latin America's erstwhile dormant masses. As mandatory foot soldiers in imperialism's battle against this process of mass radicalisation, the dominant media have sought to preside over the voiceless by putting lies across as truths. In this manner the global media industry seeks to sustain imperialism's hegemony over not only the Latin American continent with its 500 million struggling subjects, but the great majority of the world's wretched masses. Contemporary developments in a range of Latin American countries–Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Venezuela, and others–show quite demonstratively the emergence of a new, radical political ethos amongst the continent's ordinary, struggling subjects, evoking both a measure of optimism amongst oppressed subjects elsewhere and overpowering responses from reactionary agents. By looking at the Latin American continent critically and truthfully, and more so, by contesting the ‘mechanisms of disinformation’, scholars of culture hopefully could reclaim their authentic purpose in the intellectual sphere and meaningfully contribute to the invention of another world. © 2009, Copyright Unisa Press.",

Eighty-one 4-year-old girls were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in which they individually viewed a videotaped interaction of two children. Subsequently, children were interviewed by either their parent or a ""parent stranger"" using either a standardized set of misleading or nonmisleading questions. Results revealed that children in the misleading condition were more suggestible when misinformation was introduced by a stranger than by their parents. However, in the nonmisleading condition, children reported a greater amount of both accurate and inaccurate information to their parents than to strangers. Differences in children's accuracy are explained in terms of children's familiarity and trust with interviewers and perceptions of interviewer credibility. Implications for professionals interviewing children are discussed.",

In Experiment 1, adult pairs comprising one participant and one experimental confederate viewed a video clip of a staged theft. Half of the participants were then misinformed by the confederate that the thief's accomplice had blue eyes (in fact, they were brown). Next, individual participants described the accomplice and completed a target-absent photographic line-up task comprising blue-eyed members. Misinformed participants were several times more likely than controls to describe the accomplice as having blue eyes, and twice as likely to identify someone from the line-up. In Experiment 2, when line-up members' eye colour was digitally altered from blue to brown, the line-up effect disappeared, suggesting that the increase in identifications in Experiment 1 was not a generalised increase in willingness to choose from the line-up. In Experiment 3, we discounted the possibility that discussion alone could account for the line-up misinformation effect, by subjecting all participants to co-witness discussion.",

In this paper, we discuss the possibility that the mental health professional and client may unknowingly collaborate to create a client′s false memory of childhood sexual abuse. Both therapist and client bring beliefs into therapy, and the confirmation bias shows that people discover what they already believe to be true. What do people believe about memory? We asked 115 students for their reactions to various statements about how memory works; results showed widespread belief in the repression mechanism. A principal components analysis revealed that three larger beliefs explained 61% of the variance in the more specific beliefs: possible sources of memory distortions, memory for traumatic events, and the potential recoverability of memories. Finally, we discuss the ambiguity inherent in the term repression, as well as the generalizability of misinformation research to the repressed and recovered memories. © 1994 Academic Press.

10.1002/acp.886,mental reinstatement of the misinformation context and the misinformation effect in children and adults,"The present study investigated the effects of mental reinstatement of the context in which misleading information about an event was presented on later recognition memory for the event. Five-year-olds, 7-year-olds and adults were shown a short video depicting a children's adventure and were asked a set of misleading questions to introduce misinformation one week later. Before the recognition memory test was administered another week later, half of the participants were given instructions to mentally reinstate the context of the misleading interview. Memory was assessed with a set of forced-choice recognition questions once in the misleading interview context and for the children a second time at home one week later. When participants were instructed to mentally reinstate the context of the misleading interview prior to the recognition test, false memory reports occurred more often for adults than for children and had a stronger impact on peripheral information than on central information for both 7-year-olds and adults. When 5- and 7-year-olds were tested at home, false memory reports decreased. Thus, reinstating the context of an interview introducing misinformation can reduce the accuracy of memory reports; the context dependence of both accurate and inaccurate memory reports in children and adults is discussed.

10.1300/J455v02n03_04,an exploratory study of selected sexual knowledge and attitudes of indiana adults,"Although there are numerous ways to obtain accurate information about sexuality, research suggests that many American adults do not have accurate sexuality and sexual health knowledge. This research investigated selected sexual knowledge and attitudes of adults in Indiana. Arepresentative sample of men (n = 158) and women (n = 340) aged 18 to 89 was surveyed via telephone interviews regarding sexuality-related topics. The level of sexual knowledge was determined from 14 content based questions, for example questions about sexually transmitted infections, gender, sexual orientation, and other reproductive health topics. Additionally, Indiana adults were surveyed about their beliefs regarding certain sources of influence over young peoples' sexual values. Key findings of the research indicate that adults in Indiana do not have accurate information about sexuality and seem to have wide-spread sexualityrelated misperceptions and misinformation. This lack of sexual knowledge or misinformation may negatively impact the sexual health of Indiana adults and, by extension, their children. Additional findings and implications for educators, health professionals, and policymakers are discussed. doi:10.1300/ J455v02n03_04 © Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.",

This is particularly true in product liability cases involving alleged exposure to toxic substances like asbestos. Witnesses in these cases must recall specific brands of products that may have been used decades earlier. The present experiments investigated eyewitness memory for brand names of various kitchen products seen in a cooking show. Although memory was reasonably accurate at brief delays, within a week recognition rates for the brand names dropped to scarcely above chance; nearly half of these delayed selections were of the most familiar (but unseen) brands. Subtle and inaccurate post-event suggestions produced robust false alarm rates - nearly 70% of responses when the most popular brands were suggested.

10.1080/08878730902755523,teacher candidates’ accuracy of beliefs regarding childhood interventions,"The authors examined the beliefs of 351 teacher candidates, from various levels of training, regarding the effectiveness of potential interventions for childhood disorders. They were primarily interested in participants' responses to three categories of interventions: (a) evidence-based, (b) controversial, and (c) primarily anecdotal. They found that the participants' endorsement levels across three types of disorders (autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], and dyslexia) varied but not in a consistent manner, with only a few noticeable trends across interventions. Furthermore, respondents tended to endorse interventions, whether evidence-based or not, without admitted prior exposure to information about them. The results suggest that more attention should be paid to teaching critical evaluation skills as a part of preliminary training of future educators. The potential for practicing teachers, who often serve as a readily available consultant for parents of children with disabilities, to pass on misinformation poses a potential dilemma that should be addressed in teacher training programs. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",
10.1111/j.1745-3984.1985.tb01046.x,multiple‐choice versus free‐response: a simulation study,"Responses to a 40‐item test were simulated for 150 examinees under free‐response and multiple‐choice formats. The simulation was replicated three times for each of 30 variations reflecting format and the extent to which examinees were (a) misinformed, (b) successful in guessing free‐response answers, and (c) able to recognize with assurance correct multiple‐choice options that they could not produce under free‐response testing. Internal consistency reliability (KR20) estimates were consistently higher for the free‐response score sets, even when the free‐response item difficulty indices were augmented to yield mean scores comparable to those from multiple‐choice testing. In addition, all test score sets were correlated with four randomly generated sets of unit‐normal measures, whose intercorrelations ranged from moderate to strong. These measures served as criteria because one of them had been used as the basic ability measure in the simulation of the test score sets. Again, the free‐response score sets yielded superior results even when tests of equal difficulty were compared. The guessing and recognition factors had little or no effect on reliability estimates or correlations with the criteria. The extent of misinformation affected only multiple‐choice score KR20′s (more misinformation—higher KR20′s). Although free‐response tests were found to be generally superior, the extent of their advantage over multiple‐choice was judged sufficiently small that other considerations might justifiably dictate format choice.

The present study examined whether an individual's beliefs in the quality of their memory, relative to another person's, mediates susceptibility to memory conformity. Perceived encoding duration was manipulated by telling dyad members that one person had encoded a set of pictures for either half or twice as long as their partner. In fact, actual encoding duration was the same for all participants. Dyad members each encoded slightly different versions of otherwise identical pictures and discussed them prior to an individual free recall test. Participants who believed that they had encoded the pictures for half as long as their partner were more susceptible to memory conformity, as indicated by their increased tendency to report errant items at test that had been encountered from their partner rather than items that they had actually seen. This effect of perceived encoding duration on memory conformity was mediated through response order. A source monitoring test found that these unseen items were errantly attributed to the pictures approximately 50% of the time. The findings are discussed in relation to the role of metamemory in susceptibility to memory conformity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

10.1177/0146621697211006,a comparative study of measures of partial knowledge in multiple-choice tests,"A common belief among many test experts is that measurements obtained from multiple-choice (MC) tests can be improved by using evidence about partial knowledge. A large number of methods designed to extract such information from direct reports provided by examinees have been developed over the last 50 years. Most methods require modifications in test instructions, response modes, and scoring rules. These testing methods are reviewed and the results of a large-scale empirical study of the most promising among them are reported. Seven testing methods were applied to MC tests from four different content areas using a between-persons design. To identify the most efficient methods and the optimal conditions for their application, the results were analyzed with respect to six different criteria. The results showed a surprisingly large tendency on the part of the examinees to take advantage of the special features of the alternative methods and indicated that, on average, high ability examinees were better judges of their level of knowledge and, consequently, could benefit more from these methods. Systematic interactions were found between the testing method and the test content, indicating that no method was uniformly superior.",
10.1016/j.actpsy.2007.06.001,i still think it was a banana: memorable 'lies' and forgettable 'truths',"Interpersonal influences on cognition can distort memory judgements. Two experiments examined the nature of these 'social' influences, and whether their persistence is independent of their accuracy. Experiment 1 found that a confederate's social proximity, as well as the content and the confidence of their utterances, interactively modulates participants' immediate conformity. Notably, errant confederate statements that 'lied' about encoded material had a particularly strong immediate distorting influence on memory judgements. Experiment 2 revealed that these 'lies' were also memorable, continuing a day later to impair memory accuracy, while accurate confederate statements failed to produce a corresponding and lasting beneficial effect on memory. These findings suggest that an individual's 'informational' social influence can be selectively heightened when they express misinformation to someone who suspects no deceptive intent. The methods newly introduced here thus allow multiple social and cognitive factors impinging on memory accuracy to be manipulated and examined during realistic, precisely controlled dyadic social interactions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Kindergarten children participated in a magic show and about 40 days later had a memory test. Between the magic show and the memory test, the children were suggestively interviewed either one time in a relatively 'early' interview (temporally closer to the magic show than the memory test) or a relatively 'late' interview (closer to the memory test than the magic show), or in both suggestive interviews. The timing of the suggestive interviewing was manipulated so that the interview was temporally distant from the event or memory test or temporally close to the event or memory test. Repeated interviewing heightened misinformation effects only when the children received the two interview sessions temporally close to the event and memory test.

Relations between misinformation acceptance and compliance were also examined. The classic three-stage misinformation paradigm (Loftus, 1979) was employed, with a multi-component recognition test added. Either immediately or 2 weeks after viewing a distressing film, 232 adults read a narrative (misleading or control) about the murder and then took a recognition test that tapped memory for central and peripheral details. Test-item order either matched the chronology of the film or was randomly determined. Significant misinformation effects were obtained. Moreover, control participants were more accurate in response to questions about central than peripheral information; however, this was not so for misinformed participants. Sequential but not random retrieval order resulted in a higher proportion of correct responses for central as opposed to peripheral misinformation questions. Compliance was significantly related to misinformation effects. Delay increased participants' suggestibility, impaired memory accuracy, and produced higher confidence ratings for misinformed participants compared to controls. Findings indicate that even for a highly negative event, adults' memory is not immune to inaccuracies and suggestive influences.",
10.1080/02602930410001689153,multiple choice and true/false tests: reliability measures and some implications of negative marking,"The standard error of measurement usefully provides confidence limits for scores in a given test, but is it possible to quantify the reliability of a test with just a single number that allows comparison of tests of different format? Reliability coefficients do not do this, being dependent on the spread of examinee attainment. Better in this regard is a measure produced by dividing the standard error of measurement by the test's 'reliability length', the latter defined as the maximum possible score minus the most probable score obtainable by blind guessing alone. This, however, can be unsatisfactory with negative marking (formula scoring), as shown by data on 13 negatively marked true/false tests. In these the examinees displayed considerable misinformation, which correlated negatively with correct knowledge. Negative marking can improve test reliability by penalizing such misinformation as well as by discouraging guessing. Reliability measures can be based on idealized theoretical models instead of on test data. These do not reflect the qualities of the test items, but can be focused on specific test objectives (e.g. in relation to cut-off scores) and can be expressed as easily communicated statements even before tests are written. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",

Respondents possessed similar knowledge of age-related trends in suggestibility the positive effects of a pre-misinformation warning, and the negative influence of longer delays between the event/ misinformation and event/final memory test.

Laypeople rated themselves as being largely unfamiliar with witness suggestibility research and thought that expert testimony would be beneficial.

In fact, both the reading and the post-reading interviews were scripted. In one version of the interview, the client incorrectly recalled an item of information that the psychic had given her, and in the second version she correctly recalled what the psychic had said. Participants' level of belief in the paranormal and recall of the reading were assessed. It had been hypothesized that believers would be more susceptible to a misinformation effect in this context. In fact, the believers' recall of the reading was inaccurate even without exposure to misinformation. Non-believers remembered the reading quite accurately when not exposed to misinformation but their recall was as poor as that of the believers when exposed to misinformation. © 2009 SAGE Publications.",
NA,young women's misinformation concerning it careers: exchanging one negative image for another,"This research reports on the results of a study of 412 girls, ages sixteen through eighteen, in a major Midwestern United States city. The study, which also uncovered unexpected racial differences, found that, contrary to the preponderance of the research evidence, most high school girls say that they do not view those who choose IT careers as being geeks or loners. These results, which also contradict widely held beliefs, suggest the need to reassess resources currently allocated to combat the geek and loner images, particularly in large urban areas. Unfortunately, the results are not as positive as they might seem at first glance. More than half of the girls studied believe that people who choose IT careers are obsessed with computers. This new misinformation, rooted in girls' personal experiences, is likely to prove even more difficult to counter than the geek image that it appears to be replacing.",
NA,aids radio triggers.,"In April 1991, the Ethnic Communities' Council of NSW was granted funding under the Community AIDS Prevention and Education Program through the Department of Community Services and Health, to produce a series of 6x50 second AIDS radio triggers with a 10-second tag line for further information. The triggers are designed to disseminate culturally-sensitive information about HIV/AIDS in English, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Khmer, Turkish, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Arabic, Cantonese, and Vietnamese, with the goal of increasing awareness and decreasing the degree of misinformation about HIV/AIDS among people of non-English-speaking backgrounds through radio and sound. The 6 triggers cover the denial that AIDS exists in the community, beliefs that words and feelings do not protect one from catching HIV, encouraging friends to be compassionate, compassion within the family, AIDS information for a young audience, and the provision of accurate and honest information on HIV/AIDS. The triggers are slated to be completed by the end of July 1991 and will be broadcast on all possible community, ethnic, and commercial radio networks across Australia. They will be available upon request in composite form with an information kit for use by health care professionals and community workers.",

The students also completed two personality inventories [NEO PI-R, Costa, P. T., & McCrae, R. R. (1992). Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI R) and NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Odessa, Florida: Psychological Assessment Inventories.; Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ); Tellegen, A. (1982). Brief manual for the differential personality questionnaire. Unpublished manuscript, University of Minnesota, Department of Psychology, Minneapolis.], and four measures of perceived control. Findings on both suggestibility measures indicated that adults who were more suggestible had poorer recall of the original event. In addition, suggestibility on the GSS 2 was predicted by the perceived control dimensions of memory efficacy and locus of control, by facets on the extraversion and conscientiousness domains of the NEO PI-R, and by the traditionalism scale of the MPQ. In contrast, suggestibility on the Misinformation Paradigm was associated with facets on the openness to experience and agreeableness domains of the NEO PI-R. The results are discussed in terms of the multidimensionality of eyewitness suggestibility. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",
10.1348/026151001166227,memory for an observed event in the presence of prior misinformation: developmental patterns of free recall and identification accuracy,"The present study compared developmental patterns of children's and adults' abilities to give a free narrative of a videotaped event and to identify the persons involved from a set of faces and explored consistency of performance across the two tasks. A total of 284 participants from four age groups (6-, 8- and 10-year-old children, and adults) were included. The results revealed that on the one hand, free reports of an event showed a steady improvement during childhood. On the other hand, children aged 6 years and up were proficient at recognizing faces they had seen in the film: there were no age-related increases in face identification competencies in terms of hits or discrimination index. The presentation of misleading faces between encoding and retrieval led to more false alarms and fewer hits, regardless of age. Adults were more conservative than children in their selection of faces, and thus, their number of correct hits was exceeded by children. However, adults outperformed children on face identification in terms of providing more correct rejections. Consistency of performance across verbal recall and face recognition abilities was only significant in the group of 10-year-olds.",

Half the questions were straightforward and half were misleading. One-week later, children completed a recognition test to measure story memory and a set of theory-of-mind tasks to measure reasoning about mental states related to knowing. All children showed a misinformation effect at the initial interview. At the recognition test, a knowledgeable interviewer misled children who passed false-belief tasks more often than a naïve interviewer did. Knowledgeable and naïve interviewers misled children who failed false-belief tasks equally often. False-belief scores predicted the tendency to be misled more often by a knowledgeable interviewer relative to a naïve interviewer, after controlling for age and memory when not misled. Elaborated cognitive processing and/or memory source monitoring may mediate the results. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.",

Moreover, some individuals could be identified who showed a pattern of repeated susceptibility, accepting some misinformation for each of three separate events.

In this study, four-year-olds dressed up in costumes and had their photographs taken. An unfamiliar adult spoke to the children about the event either a day (immediate condition) or a month (delayed condition) later, providing both accurate and misleading information about the staged event. When questioned five weeks after the event, children in a control group who had not received the review were more inaccurate answering focused questions than children who had been reminded of the event. A review a while after the event but shortly before the interview increased the amount of details recalled and this was not at the expense of accuracy. Misinformation was seldom reported spontaneously, although children in all groups acquiesced to leading questions in line with the misleading suggestions. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
10.2307/2137904,"misinformation, mistrust, and mistreatment: family planning among bolivian market women","Results of an ethnographic study suggest that, despite stereotypes to the contrary, urban Aymara women in Bolivia want to regulate their fertility, and sociocultural norms support fertility regulation. However, the norms also make such regulation difficult to achieve. One barrier is a deep suspicion of modern medicine and medical practitioners, who are not seen as reliable sources of information. This suspicion is reinforced when the quality of health services is inadequate. Among urban Aymara, the level of acceptability of most modern methods of contraception is low. Many would prefer to use traditional methods, even when use of these methods entails considerable sacrifice and risk of conflict with their partners, unwanted pregnancies, and recourse to unsafe abortion. -Authors",

This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted. © 1986.,

In this article we briefly review the literature on memory accuracy in healthy older adults. The prevailing evidence indicates that, compared to younger adults, older adults exhibit both diminished memory accuracy and greater susceptibility to misinformation. In addition, older adults demonstrate high levels of confidence in their false memories. We suggest an explanatory framework for the high level of false memories observed in older adults, a framework based on the theory that consciously controlled uses of memory decline with age, making older adults more susceptible to false memories that rely on automatic processes. We also point to future research that may remedy such deficits in accuracy. Copyright © 2006 Association for Psychological Science.",

This ""filling-in"" may often result in misinformation, or the belief in incorrect information (as distinguished from a simple lack of information, or ignorance). Widespread misinformation among the electorate changes our conception of democracy as a ""marketplace of ideas,"" and may have much more serious consequences than does a broad lack of information or sophistication on the part of the electorate. Data from a 1997 random-digit-dial survey of 810 adults residing in San Diego was used to test the hypothesis that listening to political talk radio leads to higher levels of both information (regarding non-ideologically charged facts) and misinformation (regarding ideologically charged facts). Analysis revealed that active listening (not only listening but also calling and/or taking action because of talk radio) corresponded to higher levels of information, regardless of the ideological nature of the talk radio programs to which the listeners were exposed. However, greater frequency of exposure to conservative talk radio independently corresponded to greater misinformation, while greater exposure to moderate programming was associated with being less misinformed, controlling for partisanship, ideology, and a number of other predictors.",

A total of 284 subjects aged between five and 64 years were shown a short video about a theft and three weeks as well as four weeks later questioned about it. The social pressure in the interview after three weeks was manipulated by asking half of the subjects suggestive and misleading questions. The other half was asked open-ended and unbiased questions. In the neutral interview four weeks later, all subjects were asked the same set of recognition questions about the event. The results revealed that preschoolers in particular had problems with the interplay between cognitive and social factors (social pressure induced through the wording of the misleading questions) in the interview setting after three weeks. In the neutral recognition test, all age groups were shown to suffer from prior misinformation to about the same extent. However, with an exception in the group of 6-year-old children the negative effect of prior misinformation on the accuracy of recognition proved to be due to items that were peripheral to the observed event.

This belief is further conveyed through Russia's attempts to influence the policies of other states in the region, most notably those in the near abroad including Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (i.e. the Baltic countries), which are regarded as part of Russia's sphere of influence. For Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, the Baltic countries were seen as a buffer zone against Western encroachment. Through a number of policies and policy levers (i.e. diplomatic pressure, propaganda and disinformation campaigns, military threats and peacekeeping deployments, economic leverage and energy controls, exploiting ethnic and social discontent, and discrediting governments via political influence and penetrating intelligence services), Russia has tried to maintain its influence upon them in order to manipulate their foreign, security and domestic strategies, and thus far, it has been unsuccessful in its attempts to do so. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

In previous research, estimation accuracy for such quantities was found to be improved by algorithmic decomposition. The present study examines (a) the estimation performance of individuals using extended algorithms in which component estimates are produced by multiple methods, and (b) the effectiveness of algorithms produced by individuals after receiving training in algorithmic decomposition. The extended algorithm approach yielded some improvement in estimation performance. Subjects trained in algorithmic decomposition were able to produce algorithms, the effectiveness of which were dependent upon the presence of misinformation about components of the quantity to be estimated.

When considering attitudes and beliefs that give rise to policies related to reproduction, it is critical to examine the ways in which the issues are framed. In this case-study-style analysis, the problematic ways in which the popular media frame issues related to reproductive justice are explored. In both popular music and television series, reproduction is framed in ways that limit reproductive justice for women. Women who actively choose to use birth control are portrayed negatively, misinformation about condoms and access to reproductive healthcare is perpetuated, and stereotypes about women and reproduction are reinforced. Based upon these analyses, it is recommended that further systematic content analyses be performed in addition to experimental work on the effects of media framing on support (or lack of support) for policies related to reproductive justice. It is also suggested that different types of media related to women's reproduction might be used to help young men and women develop skills for critically deconstructing and reframing messages about sex and reproduction put forth by various forms of media.",

Alcohol placebos affect social behaviors but not nonsocial ones, and have not previously been shown to affect memory. We investigated the effect of alcohol placebos using materials that revealed both the social and the nonsocial influences of memory. Subjects drank plain tonic water, but half were told it was a vodka and tonic; then all subjects took pan in an eyewitness memory experiment. Subjects who were told they drank alcohol were more swayed by misleading postevent information than were those who were told they drank tonic water, and were also more confident about the accuracy of their responses. Our results show that the mere suggestion of alcohol consumption may make subjects more susceptible to misleading information and inappropriately confident. These results also provide additional confirmation that eyewitness memory is influenced by both nonsocial and social factors.",

A study examined the subjective intent of DK responses in relation to the objective status of information queried, in the context of memory distorting procedures. Participants viewed a video and responded to answerable and unanswerable questions phrased in misleading or nonmisleading formats, while hypnotized or not hypnotized. Subjective meanings of DK responses were queried, and a recognition measure assessed the contents of memory. Lower DK and accuracy rates were consistently associated with unanswerable and misleading questions. One-third of DK responses were statements that the information had no not presented. When these were recoded, accuracy estimates for answerable questions decreased and more so for hypnotized participants. These results demonstrate that DK responses convey different types of information, thus accuracy estimates in studies that permit DK responses may be misestimated. Robust risks associated with asking unanswerable questions and asking questions at all were observed. Implications for working with DK responses during interviews are discussed. © 2008 American Psychological Association.",

We present such a study, and discuss two significant improvements to Mori's method. We found that subjects were more likely to report the correct answer for non-discussed critical details than discussed critical details. Our data also suggested that when subjects agreed with their partner's information during the discussion, they did so because they thought that information was accurate; only a minority of the time did they go along with their partner during discussion and revert to their own answer at the test.

Is Cuba ruled by a totalitarian, Stalinist regime? Have the Cuban people surrendered their basic liberties, even though they might have achieved their equality? How is the concept of democracy perceived and practised on the island? In terms of freedom of speech, what are the deeper meanings and implications of Castro's enduring cultural decree: within the revolution, everything, against the revolution, nothing? Since the capitalist system is based on a ‘philosophy of selfishness and brutal competition’, is it able to resolve the problems of today's world? In this regard, the article brings ‘socialism’ back into the equation, contending that it has remained fundamentally relevant in a world typified by exceeding levels of deprivation, conflict and partition. Revolutionary Cuba, in effect, has come to embrace a distinctly humanistic socialist belief system, portrayed, for example, in its unremitting concrete expression of internationalism and universal solidarity. As the supreme (prior) leader of the revolution, Castro himself is particularly recognised for his abhorrence of human prejudice, marginalisation and discrimination–an ethical framework that is manifested in Cuba's official position on race and racism. For obvious reasons, this distinguishing philosophy can be considered highly significant and appropriate to all spheres of South African society. In sum, the article sustains Fidel Castro's counter argument that the current global economic order–imposed by capitalism-imperialism through both calculated, predatory means and veiled mechanism of disinformation–is not only ‘cruel, unfair, inhuman and contrary to the inevitable course of history, but also “inherently racist”’. © 2009, Copyright Unisa Press.",

Children were presented with an event followed the next day by a Cognitive or a Memorandum interview. Children were then read a post-event summary containing misleading suggestions. The next day all children were given both standard test and modified forced-choice cued-recall tests. The free recall phase of the Cognitive interview elicited the greatest number of correct details.

10.1016/0277-9536(89)90279-7,the health of adolescents: beliefs and behaviour,"Adolescence is a period of transition from childhood to adulthood in which interlocking changes in the body, mind and social relationship take place. Healthy development depends on both a propitious environment and the action of adolescents themselves. A stable family, peace, material conditions for physical health, and educational, social and vocational opportunities with a chance to make use of them before marriage, are necessary environment conditions. However, within this context the adolescent must experiment with new behaviours and relationships inevitably courting some risks. Adolescent health is especially linked to behaviour. If the environment is inadequate or dangerous and the adolescent lacks self-esteem, behaviours dangerous to health are more likely to occur. These include: precocious and unprotected sexual behaviour sometimes resulting in too early or unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; injuries arising accidentally from risk taking behaviours especially when combined with alcohol or drugs; intentional injury whether self-inflicted or inflicted by others; and poor eating and habits of hygiene leading to obesity, or emaciation, acne and poor teeth and gums. Adolescent behaviour is often governed by their beliefs about what others think. Two way communication in a trusting atmosphere will reduce myths and misinformation and encourage healthy behaviour. The promotion of health, the prevention of problems, and their treatment and rehabilitation when they arise can best be accomplished with the active co-operation of young people. © 1989.",

It is shown that misinformation always and necessarily results in expected item scores lower than those associated with complete igno rance. Moreover, it is shown that some re sponse/scoring methods penalize all conditions of misinformation equally, and others have varying penalties according to the number of wrong choices the misinformed examinee has categorized with the correct choice. One method exacts the greatest pen alty when a specific wrong choice is believed cor rect; two other methods provide the maximum pen alty when the examinee is confident only that the correct choice is incorrect. Partial information is shown to yield substantially different expected item scores from one method to another. Guessing is an alyzed under the assumption that examinees guess whenever it is advantageous to do so under the scoring method used and that these conditions would be made clear to the examinee. Additional guessing is shown to have no effect on expected item scores in some cases, though in others it is shown to lower the expected item score.

10.1016/0277-9536(95)80014-B,prediction of attitudes towards restrictive aids policies: a structural equation modelling approach,"The purpose of the study was to test a prehypothesized structural equation model of predictors of attitudes towards restrictive AIDS policies. It was assumed that such attitudes are under influence of both cognitive processes and more general attitudinal structures. The hypothesized model was tested against empirical data from a nation-wide survey of Norwegian adults, including 543 males and 577 females. The proposed model fit the data reasonably well. As expressed by total effect education was the most important predictor of AIDS policy attitudes. However, the most notable finding appeared to be the strong direct effect exerted by attitudes towards minorities. Misinformation about AIDS transmission and sexual attitudes also exerted significant direct effects upon AIDS policy attitudes. The results clearly demonstrate that AIDS policy attitudes are not cognitively based alone but also reflect more general attitudinal structures. Thus choosing a strategy which is primarily based on increasing the flow of factual AIDS information in order to remedy casual contact beliefs, will not be sufficient to prevent stigmatized and negative AIDS attitudes. This is more evident in that beliefs about modes of AIDS transmission, as reported in this study, seem themselves to have a symbolic component.

10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.02.008,assessment of calibration for reconstructed eye-witness memories,"Two experiments examined confidence judgments associated with eyewitness memory for events to misinformation [Loftus, E. F. (1975). Leading questions and the eyewitness report. Cognitive Psychology, 7, 560-572]. Participants in each experiment watched videos depicting crimes and either responded to questionnaires (Experiment 1) or read narratives (Experiment 2) containing veridical or non-veridical information. Upon testing for memory performance 24 h later, participants exposed to misinformation accepted the misinformation as part of their memory of the events in the videos. In both experiments, confidence judgments of participants subjected to misinformation were high and comparable to those of participants not subjected to misinformation. The relationship between accurate responding and confidence was assessed via calibration analysis [Yates, J. F. (1990). Judgments and decision making. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall]. Performance on various measures of calibration was generally better for participants who were not exposed to misinformation. We conclude that confidence judgments can depend on factors other than those that improve the accuracy of memory, such as the retrieval fluency of one's memories. © 2009.",
10.1080/10999940903088952,ain‖t i a man: gender meanings among black men who have sex with men,"Since the onset of HIV/AIDS, African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the disease. They account for the largest proportion of new HIV diagnoses and AIDS-related deaths in this country; more than half of them are men who have sex with men (MSM). Prevention efforts to stem the spread of this disease have been severely hampered by stigmatization and misinformation about MSM culture and identity. Their focus has been on labels such as “gay” or “down low” rather than on behaviors and, much to the detriment of African Americans, has avoided gender identity. A popular argument for negative attitudes about MSM has been that their male identity is somehow incomplete or flawed, that their sexual identity somehow diminishes and skews their personal identity as men. This perceived incompleteness has been used to justify exclusion and perpetuate disparities in health care and disease prevalence. It has been found that cultural beliefs about masculine identity influence health behaviors among men and as such can contribute to strategies to improve death and combat disease. This article is part of a larger exploration of meaning, identity, and risk that examined and described cultural beliefs of 20 African American MSM in Detroit, MI, using ethnographic methods. Its rationale was that in order to understand sexuality involving two men it was essential to understand the designation of “man” itself. Toward that end, participants responded to the question “What does it mean to be a man?” Data analysis was driven by key characteristics and revealed four significant categories of meaning, i.e. personal character, social expectations, sexuality, and biology. Findings suggest that African American MSM share traditional Western beliefs about gender regardless of their public persona. Prevention efforts with gender as a point of departure may be more effective among African American MSM than those grounded in sexual orientation. This information offers valuable insight into the design and implement of programs to improve health among this group. © 2009 The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.",

In the baseline session, accuracy was an increasing function of age, but children at each age were deceived about real fruit content of artificial fruit products. In session 2, the experimental group saw TV ads for 6 products embedded in a program (naturalistic viewing). They then judged fruit content for these six advertised products, plus a matched set of six for which ads were not shown. Controls saw toy ads on TV, and then judged the same 12 products. In session 3, subjects in each group saw the same ads they had seen in Session 2, without the program and with instruction to attend very carefully to messages in the ad (intensive viewing). They then judged all 12 products again. After naturalistic viewing, few significant differential changes from baseline were found. But after intensive viewing, accuracy of judgment of advertised artificial fruit products was lower than baseline among experimental group children. By contrast, accuracy was higher than baseline both for control children's judgements of ""advertised"" prod-. © 1981.",
10.1007/BF02438164,assessment of sexual beliefs and information in aging couples with sexual dysfunction,"The incidence and prevalence of sexual dysfunction indicate that a large portion of the U.S. population will experience a sexual dysfunction, with older individuals being particularly at risk. Cognitive factors (e.g., attitudes, misinformation, beliefs) may contribute to the development of sexual dysfunction or influence response to treatments. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a brief instrument designed to assess information and beliefs regarding sexual functioning in an aging population. Results indicate that the Sexual Beliefs and Information Questionnaire (SBIQ) had adequate test-retest reliability and is an internally consistent measure of sexual knowledge and beliefs. Most individuals had adequate knowledge regarding sexual functioning as indicated by correct responses to most items; however, there were several items missed more often than expected. Exploratory factor analysis suggests an underlying five-factor structure of the SBIQ. Scores were not correlated with years of education, mood, or marital satisfaction. Scores on the SBIQ improved after a brief standardized educational intervention. The SBIQ is a simple and psychometrically sound measure of sexual knowledge and myths that can assist clinicians to identify and possibly rectify knowledge deficits.",
10.1207/s1532480xads0202_4,children’s susceptibility to repeated questions: how misinformation changes children’s answers and their minds,"Kindergarten and Grade 2 children viewed a brief video depicting a theft and were interviewed over a 6-week period. Children were asked unbiased or misleading questions at each of 4 interviews, and their free recall and recognition memories were assessed repeatedly. Unbiased questions produced lower levels of correct and higher levels of incorrect responses than did misleading questions. Correct free recall for central items declined and incorrect free recall for noncentral items increased over sessions. Recognition accuracy for noncentral items was lower for children who were given their first recognition test at 2 weeks as opposed to 6 weeks, and kindergarten children given misleading questions increased the number of recognition errors they made from their initial (2 week) to their final recognition test. Our results concerning the timing of recognition memory assessments suggest that multiple interviews with repeated leading questions lead children, especially kindergartners, to change not only their answers, but also their memory representations. Possible reasons for the effects of unbiased questions on later performance are discussed, and our results are contrasted with research using the false-memory creation paradigm and possible reasons for the discrepancies in findings are suggested. © 1998 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.",
10.1080/03057070601136673,"hiv/aids in south african documentary film, c. 1990-2000","Documentary film has historically been used as a medium of mass education on issues of social import. Although initially employed in South Africa for colonial propaganda, under apartheid the medium was used both to expose and resist state oppression. When the HIV/AIDS pandemic began in the 1980s, western film-makers harnessed the documentary format in order to foster awareness and challenge misinformation about the disease. This was also the case in South Africa, which saw the construction and perpetuation of numerous harmful myths about HIV/AIDS in tandem with rapidly increasing rates of transmission from the early 1990s. While government ineptitude meant that public education about the disease was severely lacking until the closing years of the century, numerous films were produced, often with corporate sponsorship, in order to educate the public about modes of transmission, prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. This article analyses the content and meaning of these films, which provide important insights into the historical development of social perceptions of the disease. Born of the racially polarised and politically volatile climate of the 1990s, prejudicial and stigmatising images were presented in many of the documentaries under review. Racism and homophobia were particularly evident. Their verbal and visual depiction is discussed in the first section of this article. The responses of successive South African governments to the pandemic, alongside its evaluation in the documentaries, is the subject of the second section. Lastly, the portrayal of gender in these films is explored, with particular attention to the themes of female vulnerability and male recalcitrance. The article concludes with some general observations about the positive and negative aspects of the documentaries, their impact on public perceptions of HIV/AIDS in South Africa, and the discourse that currently dominates HIV documentary films and programmes there.",
10.3758/BF03197083,creating new memories that are quickly accessed and confidently held,"In two experiments involving a total of 542 subjects, a series of slides depicting a burglary was shown. After the initial event, subjects were exposed to one or more narratives about the event that contained some misinformation or neutral information about four critical details. Finally, subjects were tested on their memories of what they saw, and their reaction times and confidence levels were measured. When subjects took a standard test in which the misinformation item was a possible response option, they responded very quickly and confidently when making this incorrect choice. Misled subjects responded as quickly and confidently to these ""unreal"" memories as they did to their genuine memories. It does not seem, then, that the misinformation effect arises from a large proportion of subjects who must resolve a conflict between two memories when they are tested, a conflict that would be expected to take time. When subjects took a modified test in which the misinformation item was not a possible response, misled subjects were as accurate as were controls, but they responded more slowly, regardless of whether they ultimately chose the right or wrong option. These findings indicate that misinformation does introduce some form of interference not detected by a simple test of accuracy. © 1989 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
NA,cross-border education: conceptual confusion and data deficits,"It is no longer just students who are moving across borders to study. Program and institutions/providers are delivering foreign education programs and qualifications to students in their own countries. A whole new world of international academic mobility is opening up. This article looks at the concepts of cross-border, transnational, and borderless education in terms of key and common elements, and proposes a number of typologies to classify the growing diversity of providers and delivery modes. The serious absence of reliable statistical data on the volume, type, destination, impact and trends related to education being delivered across borders is discussed. This article argues that the lack of solid information on program and provider mobility creates an undesirable environment of speculation, confusion and often misinformation. This can have negative consequences in terms of confidence in the quality and dependability of cross-border education provision and it impedes the analysis needed to underpin solid policy and regulatory frameworks.",
10.3758/BF03202511,discrepancy detection and vulnerability to misleading postevent information,"When people are exposed to misleading details after a witnessed event, they often claim that they saw the misleading details as part of the event. We refer to this as the misinformation effect. In four experiments, involving 570 subjects, we explored the role that discrepancy detection plays in the misinformation effect. Experiment 1 showed that subjects who naturally read a post-event narrative more slowly were more resistant to the effects of misleading information contained in the narrative. In Experiment 2, subjects who naturally read more slowly were more likely to detect a discrepancy between what they were reading and what was stored in their memory. In Experiment 3, subjects who were instructed to read slowly were more likely to detect a discrepancy than were those who were instructed to read quickly. In Experiment 4, subjects who were instructed to read slowly were more resistant to misleading postevent information. Taken together, these results suggest that longer reading times are associated with a greater scrutiny of postevent information. This leads to an increased likelihood that discrepancies will be detected and that the misinformation will be resisted. © 1986 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1006/jecp.1995.1038,mother knows best: effects of relationship status and interviewer bias on children’s memory,"This study examined whether interviewer status or a preconceived bias affect: (a) children′s memory and suggestibility or (b) adults′ descriptions of children′s reports. Forty 4-year-olds participated in play activities with a research assistant. Each child was then interviewed either by the child′s own mother or by an unfamiliar female. Interviewers were instructed to find out what happened (free interview), but half of the interviewers were misled (biased) about the play activities prior to the interview. To examine how accurately adults recount children′s reports, the interviewers were asked to write postinterview descriptions of the play session. Children were then questioned by the interviewer again, who asked a predetermined set of questions (structured interview). Analyses revealed that during the free interview, questioning styles of mothers and strangers differed in several ways: mothers were more task-oriented, whereas strangers spent more time building rapport and were more open-ended in their approach. Biased compared to unbiased interviewers asked more questions about the misinformation provided. Children′s free recall accuracy suffered (e.g., they minimized what occurred, made more order errors) when they were interviewed by biased versus unbiased strangers but not when interviewed by biased versus unbiased mothers. The interviewers′ descriptions of the children′s experiences were generally correct, although mothers reported more correct details than strangers about certain categories of information. Exposure to the biasing misinformation led to greater inaccuracy in interviewers′ descriptions. During the structured interview, children were less susceptible to suggestions of abuse when questioned by their mothers than by strangers. The findings are discussed in relation to concerns about children′s eyewitness memory and adults′ interviews of children. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.",

(Descartes, <italic>Principles of Philosophy</italic> (1644)) “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction”; “we know where they are.” These statements, made in 2002 and 2003 by the US Vice President, Dick Cheney, and the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, respectively, turned out to have no basis in fact when the post-invasion search for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq failed to turn up any tools of chemical or biological warfare, let alone the massive stockpiles that US officials insisted had been hidden by the Iraqi regime. Notwithstanding, polls conducted in the United States for up to a year after the invasion, by which time the absence of WMDs had become fully evident and made public, continued to reveal a persistent belief in their existence among 20% to 40% of respondents (Kull <italic>et al</italic>., 2004; PIPA, 2004).

10.2307/2060253,attitudes and practice of contraception in kenya,"The data indicate that in modern Kenya the economic strains arising from larger numbers of surviving children with-in in the family are clearly and acutely felt by the rural respondents. Nevertheless, transition to a smaller family system is impeded by lack of information or by misinformation about the means to achieve control over fertility by those who might wish to do so. In the absence of widespread knowledge of safe and reliable contraceptives, ideals of family size, on the average, tend to remain near the average levels of achieved fertility. While there is a substantial minority of women who express a desire for a smaller number ofchildren than they will, in all probability, have, their ideals tend not to be followed up by action to achieve their goal. Accurate knowledge of and access to the possibility of more safe and reliable techniques of contraception are clearly necessary, although possibly not sufficient, conditions for any alteration in family size in Kenya. © 1968 Population Association of America.",

Based on recent affect-cognition theories and research on eyewitness memory, three experiments predicted and found that positive affect promoted, and negative affect inhibited the incorporation of misleading information into eyewitness memories. This effect was obtained for both positive and negative events (Experiment 1), and for recorded as well as real-life incidents (Experiment 2). Participants had no meta-cognitive awareness of these mood effects, and affect-control instructions were ineffective in preventing them (Experiment 3).

Two independent factors - prestory knowledge and poststory suggestions - were crossed to examine the effects on children's story recall. The results indicated that prestory social knowledge about the story protagonist as well as academic knowledge relating to the content of the story influenced the accuracy of children's recall immediately after the story presentation. Following the suggestive interview, children reported interviewer-provided social and academic misinformation to a greater extent when the misinformation was consistent with their prior knowledge. In contrast, children were more likely to refute misinformation that contradicted their academic knowledge. These findings are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying the knowledge-memory and knowledge-suggestibility linkages.",

By the 1960s the consensus had fragmented under the weight of these contradictions, and new politically active groups emerged. With the growing realization that containing communism had made the United States appear increasingly like its enemy, with domestic surveillance, purges, and disinformation generating a credibility gap, the moral certitude of the cold war consensus faded into increasing ambiguity. This ambiguity, emergent in the 1950s and apparent to very close reading in High Noon and The Tin Star, becomes clearer by 1959 (Warlock) and loses all semblance of subtlety by 1968 (Firecreek). The articulation of these various elements-cultural consensus, government, youth, and gender-reveals in these films a growing discomfort with American cultural norms, ambiguity about moral action, and increasing doubt that moral action is possible within the American community.

10.3758/BF03193059,habitual acceptance of misinformation: examination of individual differences and source attributions,"This study identifies individuals who are habitually susceptible to accepting postevent misinformation across testing on three separate events. The results indicate that those individuals identified as habitually susceptible exhibited higher dissociation scores and less of an association between memory accuracy and confidence than did the individuals identified as nonhabitually susceptible. When they were asked to identify the source of the remembered information, similar patterns of source attributions were found for all individuals when they were responding correctly and incorrectly to nonmisinformation and when they were correctly rejecting items of misinformation. Importantly, from a source-monitoring perspective, individuals identified as habitually susceptible demonstrated a different pattern of source attributions than did those classified as nonhabitually susceptible when they were accepting misinformation. Habitually susceptible individuals were as likely to attribute the source of their memory incorrectly to something seen in the experienced event as to attribute it correctly to something read after the fact.

10.3758/BF03210558,misinformation revisited: new evidence on the suggestibility of memory,"In three experiments involving a total of 623 subjects, a series of slides was shown depicting a student in a college bookstore stealing a variety of items. Next, subjects read a narrative describing the event that contained some misinformation and some neutral information about several critical details. Finally, subjects took a memory test. On this test, subjects were asked to list exemplars of 20 specified categories but were instructed not to list any items that they saw in the slide sequence. Analogous to Lindsay's (1990) adaptation of Jacoby, Woloshyn, and Kelley's (1989) ""logic-ofopposition"" paradigm, the tendency to report suggested details was thus set in opposition to the ability to remember the source of those details. Therefore, we interpreted failure to include suggested details as exemplars as evidence that subjects believed those details had been present in the event. Analysis of subjects' responses under opposition instructions suggests that some misled subjects come to genuinely believe that they saw items that, in reality, were only suggested to them. © 1995 Psychonomic Society, Inc.",
10.1027/1015-5759.23.3.185,development and validation of the implicit memory theory scale,"The present research developed and tested a new individual-difference measure of beliefs about autobiographical memory. We assumed that someone's implicit memory theory results in high or low skepticism about memory credibility. Based on the metamemory literature we hypothesized that this skepticism might be a predictor of memory accuracy in various memory tasks. The first phase of the research developed the Implicit Memory Theory Scale (IMTS). The exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors that were converted into three subscales of the 37-item measure. Cronbach a coefficients and test-retest correlations showed acceptable to high reliability for the global scale and three subscales. Validation studies indicated that the scale was sensitive to individual differences in professional knowledge of autobiographical memory and manipulation that involved providing respondents with this kind of knowledge. As predicted, IMTS scores were associated with accuracy in a misinformation experiment. The potential utility of the IMTS for memory research and an applied setting is discussed. © 2007 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers.",
10.1080/0950069930150502,how wetland habitats are perceived by children: consequences for children’s education and wetland conservation,"An appreciation of wet habitats is happily being engendered through the now prominent use of pond‐dipping in both formal teaching in primary schools and informal work at field centres and country parks. Yet wetlands (marshes, bogs, swamps, carrs and river meadows) are greatly threatened habitats for which education is not stemming a tide of destruction. Underlying this is a low perception of their value as natural systems by an adult community that regards them as undesirable, dangerous places. This perception may be innate, the product of long evolutionary association with the negative aspects of wetlands such as disease and impenetrability. Or it may arise simply by learned conditioning, ultimately based on common sense but, in the technological world, at least, no longer justified. A test of these hypotheses ‐innate versus conditioned perception ‐was carried out by gathering the views of 183 children aged 6/7 (top infants) and 10/11 (top juniors) in three schools. An innate perception would mean that perception of wetlands was highly negative from the outset and stayed much the same or even improved with age and experience. A conditioned response might be indicated by a view that became more negative with age. Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire in which the children chose adjectives they associated with particular animals or habitats and an interview in which they were shown pictures of habitats and asked for their reactions. Perceptions of infants towards bogs and marshes were consistently more positive than those of juniors whilst perceptions of woodlands improved with age. Perceptions of a variety of animals did not change with age and were much as might be expected, lending credibility to the findings concerning habitats. It is concluded that conditioning leads to negative adult perceptions of wetlands. This conditioning may come from literature, television or orally and it is not possible to rank these sources. However, a wealth of evidence does suggest that wetlands are negatively portrayed in junior and adult fiction but more positively in that written for infants. Teachers of juniors may thus have a key role to play in the conservation of wetlands by attempting positively to counteract the insidious influences of sources of misinformation. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

Prior research has shown that children change their original testimony under cross-examination, but the effect of these changes on the accuracy of children's testimony is unknown. The authors examined the effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of 5- and 6-year-old children's (N = 46) reports of a contrived event. Consistent with prior research, children made changes to their original responses during cross-examination. Furthermore, these changes occurred irrespective of original accuracy. Finally, prior exposure to misleading information did not affect children's responses to cross-examination. Even children with no prior exposure to misinformation altered their original responses, decreasing their ultimate levels of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that cross-examination style questioning is inappropriate for young children.",

Three- to four-year-olds in the video condition were less likely to accurately recall descriptive information than three- to four-year-olds in the live condition and five- to six-year-olds in either condition. Children in the video condition were less accurate in response to misleading questions than those in the live condition. When video condition three- to four-year-olds in Experiment 2 were asked nonmisleading questions that prompted them for descriptive information, they recalled descriptors less accurately than those in the live condition.

For example, claims that Iraqi forces executed coalition prisoners of war after they surrendered were retracted the day after the claims were made. Similarly, tentative initial reports about the discovery of weapons of mass destruction were all later disconfirmed. We investigated the effects of these retractions and disconfirmations on people's memory for and beliefs about war-related events in two coalition countries (Australia and the United States) and one country that opposed the war (Germany). Participants were queried about (a) true events, (b) events initially presented as fact but subsequently retracted, and (c) fictional events. Participants in the United States did not show sensitivity to the correction of misinformation, whereas participants in Australia and Germany discounted corrected misinformation. Our results are consistent with previous findings in that the differences between samples reflect greater suspicion about the motives underlying the war among people in Australia and Germany than among people in the United States.

Children (3 to 8 years old) participated in science demonstrations, listened to their parents read a story that described experienced and nonexperienced events, and subsequently discussed the science experience in two follow-up interviews. Many children described fictitious events in response to open-ended prompts, and there were no age differences in suggestibility during this phase of the interview. Accuracy declined markedly in response to direct questions, especially for the younger children. Although the older children retracted many of their false reports after receiving source-monitoring instructions, the younger children did not. Path analyses indicated that acquiescence, free recall, and source monitoring all contribute to mediating patterns of suggestibility across age. Results indicate that judgments about the accuracy of children's testimony must consider the possibility of exposure to misinformation prior to formal interviews.",

Much of the debate has been clouded by neglect of the role of misinformation and by vagueness regarding both the specification of test types and 'partial knowledge' in relation to guessing. Moreover, variations in risk-taking in the face of negative marking have too often been treated in absolute terms rather than in relation to the effect of guessing on test unreliability. Objectives: This paper aims to clarify these points and to compare the ill-effects on test reliability of guessing and of variable risk-taking. Methods: Three published studies on medical students are examined. These compare responses in true/false tests obtained with both negative marking and number-right scoring. The studies yield data on misinformation and on the extent to which students may fail to benefit from distrusted partial knowledge when there is negative marking. A simple statistical model is used to compare variations in risk-taking with test unreliability due to blind guessing under number-right scoring conditions. Conclusions: Partial knowledge should be least problematic with independent true/false items. The effect on test reliability of blind guessing under number-right conditions is generally greater than that due to the over-cautiousness of some students when there is negative marking.",
