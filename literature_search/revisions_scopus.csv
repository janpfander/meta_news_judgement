Efforts to counter this issue have led to research in deep learning and machine learning methods. However, a gap exists in effectively using contextual cues and skip connections within models, limiting the development of comprehensive detection systems that harness contextual information and vital data propagation. Thus, we propose a model of deep learning, FakeStack, in order to identify bogus news accurately. The model combines the power of pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representation of Transformers (BERT) embeddings with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having skip convolution block and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model has been trained and tested on English fake news dataset, and various performance metrics were employed to assess its effectiveness. The results showcase the exceptional performance of FakeStack, achieving an accuracy of 99.74%, precision of 99.67%, recall of 99.80%, and F1-score of 99.74%. Our model’s performance was extended to two additional datasets. For the LIAR dataset, our accuracy reached 75.58%, while the WELFake dataset showcased an impressive accuracy of 98.25%. Comparative analysis with other baseline models, including CNN, BERT-CNN, and BERT-LSTM, further highlights the superiority of FakeStack, surpassing all models evaluated. This study underscores the potential of advanced techniques in combating the spread of false news and ensuring the dissemination of reliable information. © 2023 Keya et al.

Religious instruction involves students being segregated into faith based groups so as to receive instruction in the beliefs and practices of one religion. This practice also occurs in many other countries. In Australia, the provision of RI in government schools has become increasingly controversial, resulting in numerous government reviews, law and policy changes and frequent media coverage. In this paper, I examine Australia’s RI laws, policies and other relevant literature. I argue that RI aims to indoctrinate. Consequently, it may conflict with educational efforts to combat the sorts of thinking and problems that characterise the ‘post-truth world’ – that is, a world flooded with disinformation, conspiratorial thinking and science denialism, which fosters social divisiveness and undermines effective responses to serious global problems (e.g. COVID-19, climate change). A more educational alternative to teaching about religions is recommended. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143583525"

Bridging the gap between social influence research and the cognitive science of misinformation, we examine the mechanisms through which social context impacts misinformation susceptibility across 5 experiments (N = 20,477). We find that social cues only impact individual judgements when they influence perceptions of wider social consensus, and that source similarity only biases news consumers when the source is high in credibility. Specifically, high and low engagement cues (‘likes’) reduced misinformation susceptibility relative to a control, and endorsement cues increased susceptibility, but discrediting cues had no impact. Furthermore, political ingroup sources increased susceptibility if the source was high in credibility, but political outgroup sources had no effect relative to a control. This work highlights the importance of studying cognitive processes within a social context, as judgements of (mis)information change when embedded in the social world. These findings further underscore the need for multifaceted interventions that take account of the social context in which false information is processed to effectively mitigate the impact of misinformation on the public. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185464747"

This account of individual and collective beliefs helps explain beliefs’ resilience to interventions and suggests that a promising avenue for increasing the effectiveness of misinformation-reduction efforts might involve graph-based representations of communities’ belief systems.

Cynicism generated from misinformation about trustworthy elections has attracted a growing body of individual-level social-psychological research in America and Europe. Another common problem found around the world, however, which has received far less attention, concerns credulous citizens who express considerable faith and confidence in flawed contests. This study theorises that at macro-level, the accuracy of any public judgments about trustworthy elections is likely to be mediated by the information environment in open and closed societies, as well as by the type of regime. To understand these issues, Part I summarises the conceptual and theoretical argument about trust and trustworthiness. Part II describes the sources of evidence. To apply the theory, data on public opinion is drawn from around 85 societies around the globe included in Waves 6 and 7 of the World Values Survey (2010–2022), with measures of electoral trust and subjective perceptions of electoral integrity among ordinary citizens. Institutional electoral performance indices are drawn from the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem 12.0). Part III analyses how far these independent estimates match public judgments of the trustworthiness of elections in each country – and how far such relationships are conditioned by the type of information society as well as by the type of regime. Part IV highlights the key findings and considers their broader implications for understanding the macro-level conditions for trust and trustworthiness. © The Author(s) 2023.

We report on focus group data from a purposive sample of 18 Canadians with varying sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19 vaccination attitudes. An inductive thematic analysis of this data reveals eight core themes related to vaccine hesitancy: values, trust, social environment, personal anecdotes, environmental fluctuation, prior knowledge, perceived risk & systems of care.

This study investigates how German media companies and individual journalists inform lay audiences on new publications, findings, and developments in sciences, using the platform Instagram. A representative quantitative content analysis of Instagram posts (n = 2.605) of nine wide-ranging German accounts related to science journalism shows that the three analyzed groups (public service media outlets, private outlets, and individual journalists) pursue significantly different approaches in how they communicate scientific content on Instagram—ranging from informative to entertaining posts—varying in their text length, the complexity of the media elements used, and the tone of voice. The results shed light on a diversification of journalistic approaches to communicating scientific content on Instagram, as well as which approaches seem fruitful.

However, students’ emotional reactions towards media literacy can be vastly different and, in turn, may impact their perception of truth and credibility of mixed media messages. In this study, we explored 68 non-health professions university students’ unique emotional profiles towards media literacy. We further examined whether students with different emotional profiles would differ in their credibility ratings (truthfulness, trustworthiness, and believability) of media messages that were drawn from mainstream and fake news sources. We also investigated the relationship between emotion profiles and emotional reactions towards mainstream versus fake news messages. We employed a probabilistic, latent clustering approach, latent profiling analysis (LPA), to generate latent categories of emotion profiles. LPA revealed four distinct emotion profiles that students endorsed: (1) low emotions, (2) moderate emotions, (3) high negative emotions, and (4) high positive emotions towards learning media literacy. Additional findings revealed that students with a low emotional profile tended to rate all media messages as more truthful, trustworthy, and believable than other emotion groups. Moreover, we identified that students in the moderate emotions and high negative emotions group rated fake messages with more positive emotions. This study offers insight towards the significance of understanding how emotions towards media literacy can impact the outcomes of media perception. This is an important step that will encourage educators to develop more engaging media literacy instruction and interventions. © Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185253396"

However, this field faces formidable challenges primarily stemming from limited resources, including access to comprehensive datasets, computational resources, and evaluation tools. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring various methodologies. One promising approach involves the use of feature abstraction and vectorization techniques. In this context, we highly recommend utilizing the Python sci-kit-learn module, which offers many invaluable tools such as the Count Vectorizer and Tiff Vectorizer. These tools enable the efficient handling of text data by converting it into numerical representations, thereby facilitating subsequent analysis. Once the text data is appropriately transformed, the next crucial step involves feature selection.

Misleading narratives around the virus, its origin, and treatments have had serious implications for public health. In March 2021, concerns were raised about links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZ) COVID-19 vaccine and recipients developing blood clots. This paper aims to identify whether this prompted any reaction in the diffusion of low-credibility COVID-19-relate information on Twitter. Twitter's application programming interface was used to collect data containing COVID-19-related keywords between 4th and 25th March 2021, a period centred on the peak of new coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine. We analysed and visualised the data using temporal analysis and social network analysis tools. We subsequently analysed the data to determine the most influential users and domains in the propagation of low-credibility information about COVID-19 and the AZ vaccine. This research presents evidence that the peak of news coverage linking rare blood clots with the AZ vaccine correlated with an increased volume and proportion of low-credibility AZ-related content propagated on Twitter. However, no equivalent changes to the volume, propagation, or network structure for the full dataset of COVID-19-related information or misinformation were observed. The research identified RT.com as the most prolific creator of low-credibility COVID-19-related content. It also highlighted the crucial role of self-promotion in the successful propagation of low-credibility content on Twitter. The findings suggest that the simple approach adopted within the research to identify the most popular and influential sources of low-credibility content presents a valuable opportunity for public health authorities and social media platforms to develop bespoke strategies to counter the propagation of misinformation in the aftermath of a breaking news event.

This qualitative study reports how users process health misinformation from the dominant strong-tie social media, WeChat, in China. We conducted ten on-site focus groups involving 76 adult participants. Drawing on the apomediation theory and the dual processing model of credibility assessment, we found the heuristic approach to processing health information was the dominant route of engagement. We identified four categories of credibility assessment cues, including (1) expertise, authority, and commercial intent of original sources, (2) expertise of apomediaries (i.e. social media information sharers) and generational bias, (3) clickbait and sensational content versus objective scientific style, and (4) disconfirmation versus confirmation bias. We highlight that apomediaries are playing an increasingly important role in informing credibility judgment. Specifically, younger adults have formed a generational bias of deeming older apomediaries as cues of lower credibility. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145070671"

We rely on a national Internet-based survey experiment conducted prior to the 2020 election to assess the effectiveness of both messages on citizens' support for a hypothetical proposal to postpone the presidential election. The results suggest that respondents were more likely to support postponement if they received a fake news message that fraud is common. The results also suggest that these effects are conditional; both political party and knowledge moderate the relationship. Related Articles: Aguado, N.

Therefore, evaluating the influential ability of users has become crucial to promote or curb the dissemination of specific information. Existing centrality measures have produced varying results in identifying the most influential users, but it remains a challenge to identify the most influential users in a multifaceted and consistent way in social networks, especially when only a limited number of users can be nominated. To fill this gap, this work developed an evidential reasoning-based influential users evaluation (ERIUE) model that considers multiple sources of structural information in networks. Our proposed model collates information about users’ influential ability from multiple forms of centrality measures and maps their scores to different grades in an informative belief distribution. To determine the weight of each centrality, three types of information are considered: conflict of belief distributions, similarity of probability sets, and overlap of evaluations. The information is aggregated using the recursive evidential reasoning approach based on a formulated criterion hierarchy, thereby determining the influential ability of users. The applicability of our proposed model is demonstrated by comparing it with existing measures in three real-world social networks. Our proposed model is also applicable to relevant problems beyond identifying influential users, including preventing epidemic spread, cascade failure, and misinformation dissemination in social networks. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169835723"

Such beliefs are seen to be the result of, e.g., motivated or biased cognition and believers are judged to be epistemically irrational and blameworthy in holding them. Here I develop a novel framework to explain why people form bad beliefs. People with bad beliefs follow the social epistemic norms guiding how agents are supposed to form and share beliefs within their respective communities. Beliefs go bad because these norms aren’t reliably knowledge-conducive. In other words, bad beliefs aren’t due to bad believers but due bad social epistemic norms. The framework also unifies different explanations of bad beliefs, is testable and provides distinct interventions to combat such beliefs. The framework also helps to capture the complex and often contextual normative landscape surrounding bad beliefs more adequately. On this picture, it’s primarily groups that are to be blamed for bad beliefs. I also suggest that some individuals will be blameless for forming their beliefs in line with their group’s norms, whereas others won’t be. And I draw attention to the factors that influence blameworthiness-judgements in these contexts. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185123747"

DTDs are computer-controlled AI-generated digital replicas of doctors that closely resemble their characteristics. However, there exist limitations, including the social implications of using a doctor’s identity, potential negative impacts on doctor–patient communication, and liability concerns. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of DTD usage in healthcare before widespread adoption, systematic research is essential. As a step towards this direction, in this qualitative research, we report findings from 13 semi-structured interviews with doctors. Our findings indicate that doctors believe DTDs offer benefits by saving doctors’ time through the efficient delivery of repetitive information and personalizing patient care. Moreover, while using a doctor’s identity can enhance credibility, it also raises concerns about using a doctor’s identity to spread potential misinformation.

People within a community are far more likely to share beliefs than people who are part of different communities. The spread of useful information across communities is impeded by echo chambers (far greater connectivity within than between communities) and filter bubbles (more influence of beliefs by connected neighbors within than between communities). We apply the tools of network analysis to organize our understanding of the spread of beliefs across modularized communities and to predict the effect of individual and group parameters on the dynamics and distribution of beliefs. In our Spread of Beliefs in Modularized Communities (SBMC) framework, a stochastic block model generates social networks with variable degrees of modularity, beliefs have different observable utilities, individuals change their beliefs on the basis of summed or average evidence (or intermediate decision rules), and parameterized stochasticity introduces randomness into decisions. SBMC simulations show surprising patterns; for example, increasing out-group connectivity does not always improve group performance, adding randomness to decisions can promote performance, and decision rules that sum rather than average evidence can improve group performance, as measured by the average utility of beliefs that the agents adopt. Overall, the results suggest that intermediate degrees of belief exploration are beneficial for the spread of useful beliefs in a community, and so parameters that pull in opposite directions on an explore–exploit continuum are usefully paired. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174936555"

Despite potential concerns about the abilities of laypeople to assess information quality, recent evidence demonstrates that aggregating judgments of groups of laypeople, or crowds, can effectively identify low-quality news sources and inaccurate news posts: Crowd ratings are strongly correlated with fact-checker ratings across a variety of studies using different designs, stimulus sets, and subject pools. We connect these experimental findings with recent attempts to deploy crowdsourced fact-checking in the field, and we close with recommendations and future directions for translating crowdsourced ratings into effective interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169117921"

However, the current empirical picture regarding the relationship between misbeliefs and collective action is mixed. We help clarify these associations by using two waves of data collected during the COVID-19 Pandemic (in Australia, N = 519, and the United States, N = 510) and democratic elections (in New Zealand N = 603, and the United States N = 609) to examine the effects of misbeliefs on support for reactionary movements (e.g., anti-lockdown protests, Study 1; anti-election protests, Study 2). Results reveal that within-person changes in misbeliefs correlate positively with support for reactionary collective action both directly (Studies 1–2) and indirectly by shaping the legitimacy of the authority (Study 1b). The relationship between misbelief and legitimacy is, however, conditioned by the stance of the authority in question: the association is positive when authorities endorse misbeliefs (Study 1a) and negative when they do not (Study 1b). Thus, the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and action hinges upon the alignment of the content of the conspiracy and the goals of the collective action. © 2024 The Authors.

Furthermore, it remains unclear if different deepfake formats can affect citizens to differing degrees. This study employs a 3 × 2 × 2 between-within-subjects experiment (N = 951) with the between-subjects factor format (audio vs. video vs. 360°-video) and facticity (real vs. fake) and the within-subjects factor reveal (pre vs. post-reveal). We explore what happens after revealing to a sample of German participants that they have been deceived by a deepfake. Our findings show that credibility of media drops across all formats after revealing the stimulus was fake, whereas the control group is not affected.

Rumor diffusion is one of the important problems that OSNs are facing. Finding rumor initiator in an OSN is both important and challenging. Firstly, most of the solutions proposed are based on network structure while completely ignoring network semantics. Secondly, the solutions proposed are for networks that are limited in cycles, directions, and degrees. To deal with semantics and limited network structure, researchers have proposed ontological models for OSNs. However, these models are intended to solve problems like social tagging mechanism, social network access control, rumor detection, rumor modeling, etc., rather than finding rumor initiators in OSNs. In this research article, we propose an ontology-based model for OSNs that is intended to find rumor initiators in OSNs. This model comprises three layers—design-time layer, integration layer, and runtime layer. The model maps interoperable concepts of different OSNs in the upper-level ontology, which is further used to obtain vendor-specific lower-level ontology. The model is populated and queried using the property path expressions of SPARQL to find rumor initiators for two scenarios, viz. when the veracity of the rumor is known and when the veracity of the rumor is unknown. Further, the model is assessed using the OQuaRE framework for ontology quality assessment. The OQuaRE framework evaluated our proposed model for seven characteristics of ontology quality, viz. structural, functional adequacy, maintainability, reliability, operability, compatibility, and transferability. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187477662"

However, vaccine hesitancy posed a major public health hurdle to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Online spread of vaccine conspiracy beliefs generated unwarranted mistrust and resistance to vaccines. While numerous studies have explored the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the interplay between perceived disease vulnerability, COVID-19 fear, and vaccine hesitancy. Protection motivation theory posits citizens will evaluate perceived threats and take actions to mitigate potential harm. With a large U.S. sample, path analysis demonstrated individuals’ perceived disease vulnerability was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Greater perceived disease vulnerability was associated with higher COVID-19 fear. Greater COVID-19 fear was associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Greater vaccine conspiracy beliefs associated with higher vaccine hesitancy. However, in the presence of perceived vulnerability to disease, vaccine conspiracy beliefs associated with higher fear of COVID-19 and thereby lower vaccine hesitancy. We found under circumstances of higher perceived vulnerability to disease and fear of COVID-19, vaccine conspiratorial believers were less vaccine hesitant. We discuss how public health messaging can highlight personal risks to contracting COVID-19 to appeal to those who self-identify as disease prone, but may have reservations about vaccines because of misinformation. Successfully combating diseases entails reaching and gaining cooperation from misbelievers because misinformation is expected to continue in the digital age. By understand individual differences to vaccine hesitancy, it can help increase vaccinations and prevent severe illnesses in the post COVID-19 pandemic era. © 2024 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185502922"

We encourage others to “think like an auditor” when evaluating information. Our fundamental message is that information is not automatically evidence that should be used to support conclusions. Instead, information needs to be carefully evaluated before it rises to the level of evidence to support a conclusion. © 2023, American Accounting Association.

We investigate their effectiveness in mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation related to a real-life issue in an experiment involving N = 876 individuals, of whom 364 exhibit belief perseverance bias. The effectiveness of the debiasing techniques is assessed by measuring the difference between the baseline opinions before exposure to misinformation and the opinions after exposure to a debiasing technique. Our study confirmed the effectiveness of the awareness-training and counter-speech debiasing techniques in mitigating the belief perseverance bias, finding no discernible differences in the effectiveness between the previously proposed and the new variants.

We conducted a survey amongst U.K. Facebook users (143 (57.2 %) women, 104 (41.6 %) men) to assess the extent to which the barriers to correcting others, as identified in literature across disciplines, apply to correcting misinformation on social media. We also group the barriers into factors and explore demographic differences amongst them. It has been suggested that users are generally hesitant to challenge misinformation. We found that most of our participants (58.8 %) were reluctant to challenge misinformation. We also identified moderating roles of age and gender in the likelihood of challenging misinformation. Older people were more likely to challenge misinformation compared to young adults while, men demonstrated a slightly greater likelihood to challenge compared to women. The 20 barriers influencing the decision to challenge misinformation, were then grouped into four main factors: social concerns, effort/interest considerations, prosocial intents, and content-related factors. We found that, controlling for age and gender, “social concerns” and “effort/interest considerations” have the significant impact on likelihood to challenge. Identified four factors were analysed in terms of demographic differences. Men ranked “effort/interest considerations” higher than women, while women placed higher importance on “content-related factors”. Moreover, older individuals were found to be more resilient to “social concerns”. The influence of educational background was most prominent in ranking “content-related factors”. Our findings provide important insights for the design of future interventions aimed at encouraging the challenging of misinformation on social media platforms, highlighting the need for tailored, demographically sensitive approaches. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179626045"

Despite the importance of vaccination to mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19 infection, ensuring adequate access and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine remains a pressing concern for refugee populations. Research has suggested that community-oriented approaches and open communication with trusted individuals are essential to address this challenge. Vaccine outreach efforts were performed in Syracuse, NY, by Community Health Workers (CHWs) as trusted refugee community members. This study explored CHWs’ experiences during vaccine outreach and perceptions about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among refugees, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination. Methods: A qualitative study was performed using thematic analysis following six semi-structured interviews with CHWs. Results: Four main themes supported by 16 sub-themes were extracted. CHWs described the (1) diverse beliefs and attitudes of refugees by ethnic group, with most having low vaccine acceptance at first. (2) Barriers included contextual barriers, lack of awareness, misinformation, and withdrawal when forced from vaccine mandates. However, CHWs also identified numerous (3) facilitators to vaccination, including the internal processing and eventual vaccine acceptance, supported by external messaging by CHWs and time. Culturally sensitive intervention strategies occurred through (4) CHW team efforts and their provision of reliable information to refugee clients, with openness and over time. The team efforts of CHWs significantly contributed to refugee acceptance and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: This study revealed how the refugee population changed their belief towards the COVID-19 vaccine through trust, time, and reliable information provided by CHWs and describes culturally sensitive strategies for vaccine uptake by refugees. CHWs' reflection on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among refugees during outreach efforts is an essential perspective when implementing future public health interventions. © 2024 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185814486"

Recent work building on such notions claimed that false news spreads faster than truth online because false news is more novel and therefore surprising. However, another determinant of surprise, semantic meaning (e.g., information’s consistency or inconsistency with prior beliefs), should also influence value and sharing. Examining sharing behavior on Twitter, we observed separate relations of novelty and belief consistency with sharing. Though surprise could not be assessed in those studies, belief consistency should relate to less surprise, suggesting the relevance of semantic meaning beyond novelty. In two controlled experiments, belief-consistent (vs. belief-inconsistent) information was shared more despite consistent information being the least surprising. Manipulated novelty did not predict sharing or surprise. Thus, classical information theoretic predictions regarding perceived value and sharing would benefit from considering semantic meaning in contexts where people hold pre-existing beliefs. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187708365"

This research aimed to (a) introduce a new experiential training digital literacy intervention strategy, (b) evaluate the effect of different digital literacy interventions (i.e., priming critical thinking and an experiential training exercise) on the perceived accuracy of fake news and individuals’ subsequent online behavioral intentions, and (c) explore the underlying mechanisms that link various digital literacy interventions with the perceived accuracy of fake news and online behavioral intentions. The authors conducted a study, leveraging online experimental data from 609 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to different digital literacy interventions. Next, participants were shown a Tweeter tweet containing fake news story about the housing crisis and asked to evaluate the tweet in terms of its accuracy and self-report their intentions to engage in online activities related to it. They also reported their perceptions of skepticism and content diagnosticity. Both interventions were more effective than a control condition in improving participants’ ability to identify fake news messages. The findings suggest that the digital literacy interventions are associated with intentions to engage in online activities through a serial mediation model with three mediators, namely, skepticism, perceived accuracy and content diagnosticity. The results point to a need for broader application of experiential interventions on social media platforms to promote news consumers’ ability to identify fake news content. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184192733"

In two studies (N = 884) we explored the efficacy of an individual-based approach to correcting false beliefs. We examined whether the character virtue of intellectual humility (IH)—an appreciation of one's intellectual boundaries—encourages revising one's false beliefs in response to counter-information. Our research produced encouraging but also mixed findings. Among participants who held false beliefs about the risks of vaccines (Study 1) and the 2020 US Election being rigged (Study 2), those with higher IH explored more information opposing these false beliefs. This exploration of opposing information, in turn, predicted updating away from these inaccurate health and political beliefs. IH did not directly predict updating away from false beliefs, however, suggesting that this effect—if it exists—may not be particularly powerful. Taken together, these results provide moderate support for IH as a character trait that can foster belief revision but, simultaneously, suggest that alternate pathways to combat false beliefs and misinformation may be preferred. © 2024 The Authors.

Propagation of fake news through the Internet has become rampant due to digitalisation, and the spread of fake news can cause irreparable damage to the victims. The conventional approach to fake news detection is time-consuming, hence introducing fake news detection systems. Existing fake news detection systems have yielded low accuracy and are unsuitable in Nigeria. Objective: This research aims to design and implement a framework for fake news detection using the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. Methodology: The dataset for the model was obtained from Nigerian dailies and Kaggle and pre-processed by removing punctuation marks and stop words, stemming, tokenisation and one hot representation. Feature extraction was done on the datasets to remove outliers. The locally acquired dataset from Nigeria was balanced using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques (SMOTE) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-which solved the problem of losing gained knowledge and information over a long period faced by RNN-was used as the detection model This model was implemented using Python 3.9. The model detected fake news by classifying real and fake news approaches. The dataset was fed into the model, and the model classified them as either fake or real news by processing the dataset through input and hidden layers of varying numbers of neurons. accuracy F1 score and detection time were used as the evaluation metrics. The results were then compared to some selected machine learning models and a hybrid of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory models (CNN-LSTM). Results: The result shows that the LSTM model on a balanced dataset performed best as the two news classes were accurately classified, giving an average detection accuracy of 92.86%, which took the model 0.42 seconds to detect whether news was real or fake. Also, 87.50% average detection accuracy was obtained from an imbalanced dataset. Compared to other machine learning models, SVM and CNN-LSTM gave 81.25% accuracy for imbalanced datasets and 82.14% and 78.57% for balanced datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The outcome of this research shows that the deep learning approach outperformed some machine learning models for fake news detection in terms of performance accuracy. Unique contribution: This work has contributed knowledge by employing an LSTM model for detecting Nigerian fake news using an indigenous dataset. Key Recommendation: Future research should increase the data size of indigenous datasets for fake news detection to achieve improved accuracy. © 2023, University of Nigeria Department of Mass Communication.

The repurposing of technology is innovative but brings risks, especially since AI's effectiveness depends on the data it's fed. In healthcare, ChatGPT might provide sound advice based on current medical knowledge, which could turn into misinformation if its data sources later include erroneous information. Our study assesses user perceptions of ChatGPT, particularly of those who used ChatGPT for healthcare-related queries. By examining factors such as competence, reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, and persuasiveness of ChatGPT, the research aimed to understand how users rely on ChatGPT for health-related decisionmaking. A web-based survey was distributed to U.S. adults using ChatGPT at least once a month. Bayesian Linear Regression was used to understand how much ChatGPT aids in informed decision-making. This analysis was conducted on subsets of respondents, both those who used ChatGPT for healthcare decisions and those who did not. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis, with thematic coding to extract public opinions on urban environmental policies. Six hundred and seven individuals responded to the survey. Respondents were distributed across 306 US cities of which 20 participants were from rural cities. Of all the respondents, 44 used ChatGPT for healthrelated queries and decision-making. In the healthcare context, the most effective model highlights 'Competent + Trustworthy + ChatGPT for healthcare queries', underscoring the critical importance of perceived competence and trustworthiness specifically in the realm of healthcare applications of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the non-healthcare context reveals a broader spectrum of influential factors in its best model, which includes 'Trustworthy + Secure + Benefits outweigh risks + Satisfaction + Willing to take decisions + Intent to use + Persuasive'. In conclusion our study findings suggest a clear demarcation in user expectations and requirements from AI systems based on the context of their use. We advocate for a balanced approach where technological advancement and user readiness are harmonized.  © 2024 Choudhury et al.

Using an online experiment, we show that social corrections substantially reduce beliefs in misinformation, including in beliefs deeply anchored in salient group identities. Importantly, these positive effects are not systematically attenuated by partisan motivated reasoning, highlighting a striking difference from Western contexts. We also find that the presence of a correction matters more relative to how sophisticated this correction is: substantiating a correction with a source only improves its effect in a minority of cases; besides, when social corrections are effective, citing a source does not drastically improve the size of their effect.

Theorists view publicity—a requirement that laws should be public and accessible—as having crucial normative and practical importance in liberal democracy and, more broadly, in ensuring the rule of law. Due to egalitarian concerns, laws are often long, complex, and specific to ensure that street-level bureaucrats exercise low levels of discretion in applying the law. This—what I deem the institutional publicity problem—means that the law is so inaccessible that busy, everyday citizens must turn to third-party sources to understand policymaking. These intermediaries often make mistakes promulgating the law. Misinformation is hard to counteract, and pre-existing beliefs affect information acceptance. This all represents a behavioral publicity problem: morally and legally permissible actions can complicate and undermine reasonable efforts of citizens to learn about the law. I argue that the state is caught between a rock and a hard place. While there are benefits to having the state fight against misinformation, it also raises serious concerns about democratic engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186198758"

Accuracy of knowledge about the health domains was tested in two ways: immediately after participants viewed the posters or after a 30-minute delay.

With the development of the Internet and social networks, open-data intelligence is increasingly turning from a subtle art into a “mechanical” process—the more data, the better. OSINT professionals’ competence enables verification of information and minimizes the chances of deception unless the intention of the investigation and the data’s locale are previously known to their adversary. In this very case, the hunter can get into a trap dexterously rigged by an adversary. This article discusses the risks of disinformation through open sources in the context of the Soviet concept of “reflexive control”; that is, imposing unfavorable decisions on the enemy through the introduction of incorrect premises, exemplified by the experience of the Russian–Ukrainian conflict since 2014. The article evaluates the influence exerted on the governmental and military decisions by disinformation through open sources, examining several reported cases. Systematization of data on previous attempts at reflexive control, such as Russian information operations, can increase the accuracy of assessing the depth of an enemies’ reflexion, which helps to reveal their operational plans and predict further actions because disinformation often precedes other forms of aggression. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study aims to better understand how fact-checks relate to various outcomes relevant to audiences’ resilience to false information. We randomly exposed 752 Dutch participants to fact-checks of a disputed health-related claim vs. no fact-check. The fact-checks either followed a classic format which repeated the false claim or followed a truth sandwich format wrapping the false claim in accurate information. While the truth sandwich was not effective in correcting false beliefs, it had indirect benefits. First, those who saw a truth sandwich perceived the intentions of fact-checkers more positively thinking that their intention was to inform rather than to manipulate or spread lies. Second, those who saw a truth sandwich showed the least resistance to reading subsequent fact-checks. For journalism practice this implies that different fact-check formats can be strategically employed to achieve desired outcomes. A more classic fact-check format might be preferable if the primary aim is to correct false beliefs, while the truth sandwich may be employed to reach more indirect and long-term aims like rebuilding confidence in fact-checkers or stimulating future verification behaviors. © 2024 The Author(s).

The method uses multi-source data such as night light remote sensing images, POI data and high-resolution remote sensing images. We constructed the Combined Urban-Rural Fringe Index (CUFI) model based on the characteristics of NDVI and NTL, POI kernel density value points that change from the city centre to the surrounding area. The calculation of CUFI involves three aspects. The initial step involves processing data, which includes reducing noise in nighttime light images and removing inaccurate information from POI data. The subsequent step involves calculating combined features of NTL and POI kernel density, which includes analyzing the kernel density of POI data, standardizing the results of POI kernel density and nighttime light data, computing NTL & POI indexes using the equal weight combined feature calculation method and reclassifying NTL & POI indexes.The third part involves rejecting misinformation using NDVI. This includes calculating the NDVI index using high-resolution satellite data, rejecting bare land information in the NDVI index using nighttime light data, and reclassifying the processed results. The reclassified results are then multiplied with the reclassification results of the NTL&POI index to obtain the CUFI calculation results. In order to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the method, Tangshan City, Hebei Province was selected as the experimental area, and the method was used to compare and analyse the accuracy with the traditional urban built-up area boundary extraction method. The results show that compared with the traditional method, the extraction accuracy of the CUFI method is higher, reaching 89.51%, which is able to effectively identify urban villages and lakes in the urban area, as well as improving the resolution of extracting Urban-Rural Fringe using NTL& POI methods, and also the urban-rural fringe which has weak night light and fewer POI points, but actually has urban-rural duality attributes Extraction. © 2024 The Author(s).

The first two assertions in each story were either correct information or implausible misinformation, allowing a manipulation of the (implicit) credibility of the narrator. The last assertion in each story was the critical one, and was correct information, implausible misinformation, or plausible misinformation. After reading, participants answered general knowledge questions that were related to the critical assertions they encountered during reading. Encountering misinformation led to lower accuracy than being presented with correct information, and being presented with plausible misinformation led to higher production of that misinformation. The narrator credibility manipulation interacted with the type of critical assertion: When the critical assertion was presented accurately in a story, credible narrators presenting true critical assertions led to greater accuracy on the general knowledge test than when noncredible narrators presented this same information.

However, philosophy has proposed a particular type of skepticism, termed naive skepticism, which may increase susceptibility to misinformation, especially when contrasting information from official sources. While some scales propose to measure skepticism, they are scarce and only measure specific topics; thus, new instruments are needed to assess this construct. Objective: This study aimed to develop a scale to measure naive skepticism in the adult population. Method: The study involved 446 individuals from the adult population. Subjects were randomly selected for either the pilot study (phase 2; n = 126) or the validity-testing study (phase 3; n = 320). Parallel analyses and exploratory structural equation modelling were conducted to assess the internal structure of the test. Scale reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients Finally, a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess invariance, and a Set- Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling was applied to estimate evidence of validity based on associations with other variables. Results: The naive skepticism scale provided adequate levels of reliability (ω > 0.8), evidence of validity based on the internal structure of the test (CFI = 0.966; TLI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.079), gender invariance, and a moderate inverse effect on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: The newly developed naive skepticism scale showed acceptable psychometric properties in an adult population, thus enabling the assessment of naive skepticism in similar demographics. This paper discusses the implications for the theoretical construct and possible limitations of the scale. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185508188"

Recent research has shown that partisanship and cognitive reflection (i.e. engaging in analytical thinking) play key roles in the acceptance of misinformation. However, the relative importance of these factors remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this registered study, we tested four hypotheses on the relationship between each factor and the belief in statements made by Argentine politicians. Participants (N = 1353) classified fact-checked political statements as true or false, completed a cognitive reflection test, and reported their voting preferences. Using Signal Detection Theory and Bayesian modeling, we found a reliable positive association between political concordance and overall belief in a statement (median = 0.663, CI95 = [0.640, 0.685]), a reliable positive association between cognitive reflection and scepticism (median = 0.039, CI95 = [0.006, 0.072]), a positive but unreliable association between cognitive reflection and truth discernment (median = 0.016, CI95 = [− 0.015, 0.046]) and a negative but unreliable association between cognitive reflection and partisan bias (median = − 0.016, CI95 = [− 0.037, 0.006]). Our results highlight the need to further investigate the relationship between cognitive reflection and partisanship in different contexts and formats.

Public opinion surveys reveal that high percentages of Republicans indicate that they endorse some aspects of mistaken beliefs surrounding election fraud in the 2020 election. Still, understanding how to measure the endorsement of misperceptions is critical for understanding the threat at hand. Are high levels of mistaken beliefs genuinely held, or are they partially a function of expressive responding? I address this question through a set of survey experiments encouraging accuracy-oriented processing among the general public. Using well-powered surveys of Republicans and Independents, I find that treatments designed to encourage more accurate responses are ineffective in reducing the endorsement of partisan electoral and public health misperceptions and can in some cases even backfire. These findings suggest that support for these misperceptions is genuinely held.  © The Author(s), 2022.

As the fog of war produces unreliable data, it also obstructs our capacity to monitor those harms. While some call for more data collection to advance a clear narrative of the origins of environmental harm, sociologists of risk and professional risk assessors find that the urgency of environmental hazards depends not on data alone but on who has the authority to define those risks. Without a clear understanding of how environmental experts engage in the socio-political struggles over the interpretations of risk during armed conflict, we may undervalue, first, how assessments and adequate action remain practically and politically difficult, and second, how data may be misused. Drawing on interviews with environmental experts and reports, I examine the politics of environmental expert knowledge on conflict pollution in the war in Donbas (2014–2022), a region hosting over 4500 hazardous industrial enterprises. By going beyond technological evidence collection, the article broadens our understanding of the obstacles of knowledge production and the attribution of environmental harm in highly politicized and violent contexts. Based on insights from environmental politics, the article finds that experts manage three issues undermining the reliability of environmental risks in an active warzone: pre-existing industrial pollution, environmental damage spread across government and non-government-controlled territories, and disinformation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182845535"

Poisson models showed that use of government and scientific sources was negatively associated with misinformation endorsement for non-CLI participants (IRR = .841, p .001), but not for CLI participants (IRR = .957, p = .619). These findings suggest that building and leveraging trust in important information sources are critical to the containment and mitigation of COVID-19-related misinformation in the CLI population. © 2024 Public Library of Science.

Using a preregistered quota-based online experiment in Germany (N = 1401), we tested how the effectiveness of disinformation correction in reducing climate misperceptions was influenced by correction placement (prebunking or debunking) and correction type (focused on facts, logic, or the combination of both). We investigated how populist radical-right (PRR) attitudes moderate the effect of disinformation correction and whether correction alleviates the negative effects of disinformation on efficacy beliefs to mitigate climate change (EBMCC) through reduced misperceptions. All debunking conditions and the logic-focused prebunking condition significantly reduced climate misperceptions. Prebunking was only effective under the logic-focused correction condition. We found no moderating effect of PRR attitudes on climate misperceptions, suggesting that corrections similarly benefitted all participants. In addition, a significant indirect effect of corrections was observed on EBMCC via climate misperceptions. © 2024 The Author(s).

Although some news media deliberately try to counter misinformation, it has been suggested that they might also inadvertently, and sometimes purposefully, amplify it. We conducted a two-wave panel survey in Brazil, India, and the UK (N = 4732) to investigate the effect of news and digital platform use on awareness of and belief in COVID-19 misinformation over time (January to February 2022). We find little support for the idea that the news exacerbates misinformation problems. News use broadened people's awareness of false claims but did not increase belief in false claims—in some cases, news use actually weakened false belief acquisition, depending on access mode (online or offline) and outlet type. In line with previous research, we also find that news use strengthens political knowledge gain over time, again depending on outlets used. The effect of digital platforms was inconsistent across countries, and in most cases not significant—though some, like Twitter, were associated with positive outcomes while others were associated with negative outcomes. Overall, our findings challenge the notion that news media, by reporting on false and misleading claims, ultimately leave the public more misinformed, and support the idea that news helps people become more informed and, in some cases, more resilient to misinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147579099"

This study investigates the efficacy of governmental counter-narratives in addressing misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focussing on their impact on debunking various hoaxes. The study analyses the performance of the Jabar Saber Hoaks work unit, operated by the Regional Government of West Java Province, Indonesia. Through regression analysis, which encompasses multiple linear regression models and partial correlation hypothesis testing, the research surveyed 5,000 users of Instagram and WhatsApp. The findings reveal the success of the government's counternarrative initiatives in combating widespread hoax dissemination. These counternarratives significantly contributed to reinstating credibility, educating the populace, offering alternative viewpoints, sustaining interest, and demonstrating diverse messaging effectiveness. The study underscores the critical role of credible and timely counternarratives in addressing misinformation during crises.

Such simplifications not only risk offering less reliable representations of the world, they can also turn into disruptive and harmful images of the world. In this article, students and teachers in the field of religion and theology are encouraged to value scientific research as a form of knowledge production that complicates things. In an age in which scientific knowledge is constantly contested and in which it competes with other forms of knowledge production (including problematic ones such as fake news, conspiracy theories, stereotyped representations of religion and religious others, and poorly executed journalism), it is important for students to understand that complicating things is a key step in developing reliable knowledge on religion and the (ir)religious other. This article, written for students starting out in the field of theology and religion and for those who teach them, explains how complicating things takes shape in scientific research by discussing three basic elements: (1) not taking things at face value, (2) understanding science as knowledge production and reflecting on science as production, (3) and realizing that there is no absolute certainty. © 2023 The Author.

This chapter examines three enduring challenges that affect the achievement of this goal. First, there is a perennial tension between the desire for greater coordination and oversight on the one hand and flexibility, agility, and responsiveness on the other. Moving quickly in cyberspace, often seen as an operational necessity, can make it harder for relevant entities to coordinate and oversee those same operations. Second, the fact that the United States’ chief rivals are autocracies, each of which tightly controls the Internet, introduces complications when it comes to devising appropriate responses to cyber-enabled disinformation and election meddling. Third and finally, there is the continued problem of credibility in cyberspace. The secrecy surrounding most cyber operations and the difficulty of imposing painful enough costs that would change an adversary’s decision calculus, among several other issues, imposes constraints on its utility for things like coercion. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, David V.

Most previous studies have investigated the developmental trajectories of these capacities in the age range from 3 to 10 years aiming to discern their conceptual nature. The present research examines whether intensionality incurs lower performance accuracies and longer response times than false belief in adults, using a task in which participants read sentences that explicitly state an agent’s beliefs. Experiment 1 showed that participants were less accurate in rejecting verbal probes that contradicted an agent’s alternative than false thoughts about objects. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this finding using thoughts about object identities but not properties. These results suggest that compared to false belief, intensionality is cognitively demanding for adults to process because of the availability of more than one identity candidate under the agent’s perspective. © 2024, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181508380"

Much of the previous work exploring how young people approach conflicting information has tended to focus on students in the secondary and tertiary years, often taking an epistemic approach to analysis, rather than a literacies lens. At the heart of such endeavours, however, is the need for sophisticated reading skills accelerated by shifts to digital platforms to source information. Given the limited empirical studies in the field of literacy that articulate how middle school students approach sources of information, this study investigates 45 middle school students’ (13–14 years of age) self-reported strategies for investigating health risks associated with mobile phone use. We asked the students to imagine that a close friend was worried about the health risks of using their mobile phone and had asked them for advice. Students were then prompted to describe how they would search for information about the issue and how they would know if the information was reliable. Our analysis identified three dominant themes in the interview data, namely: (i) mistrust of the internet—people can be reliable sources; (ii) reliable sourcing requires consensus across sources; and (iii) criteria help to determine a reliable source. An interesting finding was the level of scepticism of the internet expressed by students. We draw on examples from the students’ interview dialogue to illustrate the themes and engage in discourse related to their approaches including implications for teaching in English classrooms. © 2023 The Authors.

Particularly in these new media spaces, there is a rising need for science education in fostering a science media literacy that enables students to evaluate the credibility of scientific information. A key determinant of a successful credibility evaluation is the effectiveness of the criteria students apply in this process. However, research suggests that existing credibility criteria are often not integrated into students' actual social media evaluation behavior. This hints to a lack of transferability of the existing criteria. As a consequence, knowledge about how learners evaluate credibility in social media is a first step in closing this gap. In the present study, we report results from six focus groups with 21 10th-grade students (M = 15 years, 57% female, 38% male, 5% nonbinary) about their usage of different credibility criteria in the case of social media posts about climate change. The data were analyzed through qualitative content analysis and as a first step assigned to established credibility dimensions of content (what?) and source-related criteria (who?). Additionally, given the complexity of social media, we also added a composition-based category (how?). In a second analysis step, we adapted our subcategories to the recently proposed credibility heuristic by Osborne and Pimentel. The findings suggest that students generally take criteria from all three heuristic credibility dimensions into account and combine different criteria when evaluating the credibility of scientific information in social media. Based on the application of the credibility criteria to the heuristic, implications for the development of teaching materials for fostering science media literacy are discussed. © 2024 The Authors.

Perhaps this concept, which is frequently encountered in political life, provides the speaker with a freer speaking platform. Politicians, instead of presenting the reality to their constituents as it is, want to reshape this reality according to their own ideology and present it to the recipient. Politicians have certain objectives in creating such a virtual reality. These aims can be listed as keeping the voters, increasing the voting potential, and attracting undecided voters to their favor. The common result of all these aims is to gain political power or to remain in the existing power. Post-truth reality is constructed relatively more easily in social media environments. The construction of reality can be through beliefs or emotions. In such ways, the recipient is tried to be persuaded, and thus behavioral change is achieved. One of the most necessary subjects for this artificial reality atmosphere is the anti-subject. The idea that the anti-subject does not know the truth that we (you and I) know and believe and is trying to destroy it is the main theme of post-truth discourse. Politicians try to persuade the voters to believe in their own truth by expressing this idea to them. There are many examples of this around the world. In this study, firstly, the concept of post-truth is examined and its various definitions are discussed. The distinctions between the concepts of real and truth are analyzed and then it is explained how and for what purposes the concept of post-truth is used in politics. Following the comparison of post-truth and fake news, the concept is discussed within the framework of sender-receiver interaction in terms of communication. The concept is tried to be elucidated with the modalities such as /convincing/, /believing/, /being/, /appearing/. Besides, using the semiotic square, the study also tries to reveal the different purposes and forms of use of the concept of post-truth. As a result, it has been observed that the concept of post-truth is effective in many areas of contemporary societies, and rather than real information, expected and desired information has become more important. © 2023 the author(s)","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183571174"

This chapter builds on the early work by Brennan, Afroz, & Greenstead (ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, 15(3), 1–22, 2011), and reviewed the literature on adversarial stylometry, emphasizing the intersection with plagiarism and contract cheating. Research examines academic integrity through the lens of forensic linguistics and looks to the field of fake news to provide new insights. This work is relevant for scholars and practitioners interested in academic integrity, text- matching software, and security. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185964272"

Differences between social groups can culminate in a struggle between “good” and “evil” that can escalate into tension and violence. Preventing tensions and conflicts requires respect for differences, willingness to engage in dialogue, and a sound understanding of what religion is and the historical processes that have determined its development, distinguishing between empirical facts and images to which believers adhere. Because the author is a Dutch sociologist turned journalist from a conservative Christian family involved in interreligious dialogue in the Netherlands, Israel, and Egypt, the literature review presents contemporary religious developments in all three countries. The literature review is flanked by the author’s personal narrative on the events that changed his views on truth and spirituality, making him more aware of the commonalities between peoples of different beliefs and leading him to a lifelong commitment to interreligious and intercultural dialogue. © 2023 by the author.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183906304"

I find that Russians’ capacity to discern falsehoods is comparable to discernment found in other political contexts, and they could often detect false news stories. However, consumers of state media gave less accurate evaluations than consumers of independent media, and government supporters were substantially more susceptible to pro-regime misinformation than opposition-minded citizens. Supporters also strongly rejected true messages inconsistent with their political dispositions. These results help understand why in environments dominated by propaganda individuals can be quite vulnerable to information manipulation.

Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true ones-even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information. We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they perceive as more accurate-both in a general population sample, and in a sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news-and consistent with the predictions of our model-we find markedly different engagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news sites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news sites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings collected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively correlated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be straightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186741013"

Since this kind of news is disseminated in sheer volume through social media, driving the improvement of strategies for the recognizable proof of false news is necessary. Therefore, this study focuses on text analytics to derive the hidden properties of stylistic content to detect fake and real news. An erudite literature study of fake news detection diverted towards issues such as attention, context, and parallelization. In this same direction, the assessment evaluates the sequential memory-based deep learning model in comparison to the parallel memory-based deep learning model. For sequential, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-Directional LSTM, and Attention-based Bi-directional LSTM are taken into consideration. Besides, for parallel, the transformer-based BERT model is examined. To identify the efficacy of applied approaches, four datasets are taken from diverse domains such as political news, entertainment news, satire news, conspiracy news, and global pandemic news. The experimental analysis of real-world information demonstrates that the pre-trained transformer encoder-based BERT model outperforms with a quite significant margin of improvement.

However, socioscientific engagement may be influenced by sociocultural factors and mis/disinformation efforts to the widespread detriment of human and environmental well-being. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to determine how 506 post-secondary life science majors' COVID-19 related nature science (NOS) views and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance changed through pandemic responsive instruction on COVID-19 science, viral biology, and vaccines with integrated focus on NOS and mis/disinformation. This investigation also sought to reveal factors (e.g., sociocultural group membership, NOS views) that associated with changes in those students' COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance. After experiencing the pandemic responsive instruction, the students' COVID-19 vaccine acceptance/support and conspiracy resistance and trust in COVID-19 science and cognizance of its reliable and revisionary character (i.e., NOS) significantly improved from a small to large extent. Through the pandemic responsive instruction, the students' development of NOS views significantly associated with their development of higher levels of vaccine acceptance and conspiracy resistance and increases in students' vaccine conspiracy resistance significantly associated with increases in vaccine acceptance. Changes in students' vaccine acceptance and conspiracy resistance from before to after the pandemic responsive instruction also varied significantly based on sociocultural grouping (e.g., race/ethnicity and political orientation). Despite the promising impact demonstrated by the pandemic responsive instruction, vaccine conspiracy views and resistance appeared to linger among the students who notably were entering fields that deal with viruses, vaccines, and public health. Implications discussed include the importance for helping students to understand NOS relevant to SSI and analyze how sociocultural membership, motivated and identity protective reasoning processes, mis/disinformation, and trust in science influence socioscientific decision-making. © 2024 The Authors.

However, how the influence of endorsement may be modulated by concurrent disendorsement information (e.g., dislikes) is unclear. Across two experiments, we assessed the influence of relative endorsement on misinformation belief and correction acceptance. Experiment 1 exposed participants to claims and fact-checks with a high or low likes-to-dislikes ratio. Experiment 2 simplified the relative-endorsement information into a single value (i.e., a percentage). Results suggest high relative social endorsement of misinformation significantly increases misinformation belief, particularly when the endorsement information is presented as a single value.

Although conventional wisdom suggests that searching online when evaluating misinformation would reduce belief in it, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate this claim. Here, across five experiments, we present consistent evidence that online search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles actually increases the probability of believing them. To shed light on this relationship, we combine survey data with digital trace data collected using a custom browser extension. We find that the search effect is concentrated among individuals for whom search engines return lower-quality information. Our results indicate that those who search online to evaluate misinformation risk falling into data voids, or informational spaces in which there is corroborating evidence from low-quality sources. We also find consistent evidence that searching online to evaluate news increases belief in true news from low-quality sources, but inconsistent evidence that it increases belief in true news from mainstream sources.

People stuck in their homes, without work pressure, regardless of health concerns towards personal, family, or peer groups, consistently demanded information. People became engaged with misinformation while attempting to find health information content. This study used the content analysis method and analyzed 1,154 misinformation stories from four prominent signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network during the pandemic. The study finds the five main categories of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These are 1) the severity of the virus, 2) cure, prevention, and treatment, 3) myths and rumors about vaccines, 4) health authorities' guidelines, and 5) personal and social impacts. Various sub-categories supported the content characteristics of these categories. The study also analyzed the emotional valence of health misinformation. It was found that misinformation containing negative sentiments got higher engagement during the pandemic. Positive and neutral sentiment misinformation has less reach. Surprise, fear, and anger/aggressive emotions highly affected people during the pandemic; in general, people and social media users warning people to safeguard themselves from COVID-19 and creating a confusing state were found as the primary motivation behind the propagation of misinformation.

We estimate that 14.8% of Americans do not believe in climate change. This denialism is highest in the central and southern U.S. However, it also persists in clusters within states (e.g., California) where belief in climate change is high. Political affiliation has the strongest correlation, followed by level of education, COVID-19 vaccination rates, carbon intensity of the regional economy, and income. The analysis reveals how a coordinated social media network uses periodic events, such as cold weather and climate conferences, to sow disbelief about climate change and science, in general. Donald Trump was the strongest influencer in this network, followed by conservative media outlets and right-wing activists. As a form of knowledge vulnerability, climate denialism renders communities unprepared to take steps to increase resilience. As with other forms of misinformation, social media companies (e.g., X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok) should flag accounts that spread falsehoods about climate change and collaborate on targeted educational campaigns. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185268013"

Left unaddressed, online falsehoods can lead to harmful behaviours. In times of crisis, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the circulation of many myths is exacerbated, often to varying degrees among different cultures. Singapore is a multicultural hub in Asia with Western and Asian influences. Although several studies have examined health myths from a Western or Eastern perspective, little research has investigated online health falsehoods in a population that is culturally exposed to both. Furthermore, most studies examined myths cross-section-ally instead of capturing trends in myth prevalence over time, particularly during crisis situations. Given these literature gaps, we investigated popular myths surrounding the recent COVID-19 pandemic within the multicultural setting of Singapore, by examining its general population. We further examined changes in myth beliefs over the two-year period during the pandemic, and population demographic differences in myth beliefs. Using randomised sampling, two online surveys of nationally representative samples of adults (aged 21–70 years) residing in Singapore were conducted, the first between October 2020 and February 2021 (N = 949), and the second between March and April 2022 (N = 1084). Results showed that 12.7% to 57.5% of the population were unable to identify various myths, such as COVID-19 was manmade, and that three of these myths persisted significantly over time (increases ranging from 3.9% to 9.8%). However, belief in myths varied across population demographics, with ethnic minorities (Indians and Malays), females, young adults and those with lower education levels being more susceptible to myths than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that current debunking efforts are insufficient to effectively counter misinformation beliefs during health crises. Instead, a post-COVID-19 landscape will require targeted approaches aimed at vulnerable population sub-groups, that also focus on the erroneous beliefs with long staying power.

In these settings, the public continuously updates its opinions with reliable policy-relevant information, and the changes in public opinion go on to affect policy and outcomes. It is unknown whether this dynamic exists in illiberal settings where the public's access to reliable information is heavily restricted. Objectives: This article advances a theory of public opinion's dynamic relationship with policy and outcomes that applies to illiberal settings. Methods: Our study examines a vital public good in one of the world's most restrictive information environments and estimates a dynamic model of relationships among three variables—public opinion, policy, and outcomes—with a focus on public opinion and outcomes as the key dependent variables. The analysis looks at air pollution remediation in 274 Chinese localities. Results: We find that public opinion reacts to objective air pollution outcomes and not to misleading information that downplays air pollution severity, which suggests the public can accurately evaluate the reliability of available information. We also find that local public opinion's impact on local air pollution is substantively meaningful on timescales as short as 1 to 2 years, indicating that the additional policy effort prompted by public opinion change is sufficient to yield tangible real-world outcomes even in the short term. Conclusion: Public opinion has a dynamic relationship with policy and real-world outcomes even in highly illiberal settings. We argue that these findings are likely to generalize across issue domains with outcomes that can be directly observed by the public. © 2023 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164565750"

Some evidence suggests that brief media literacy interventions might serve as an important means of helping social media users discern between “real” and “fake” news headlines. However, empirical research indicates that these effects tend to be relatively modest in magnitude. To that end, this study explored the degree to which epistemic self-efficacy beliefs may be able to positively “boost” media literacy interventions. Specifically, we used a series of 2 × 2 experiments to test the contention that the combinatory effects of epistemic self-efficacy and media literacy interventions will better equip users with the resources necessary to discern between disinformation and objectively produced news content. The results failed to indicate the presence of combinatory effects.

We measured the participants’ total number of fact-checked statements and their judgment accuracy of those statements. We also measured participants’ decision time for making judgments, and their judgment confidence levels. Participants’ social presence, time pressure, and information involvement were significantly related to the number of statements they fact-checked. Their perceived social presence on a social media platform reduced their fact-checking. Time pressure increased the frequency of fact-checking and weakened the impact of social presence. Participants were less likely to fact-check statements when they had high involvement with the information, due to overconfidence.

Results: The results indicate that the correction employing strong arguments and a correction provided by the CDC heightened heuristic processing of the corrective information, which in turn increased the perceived credibility of the conspiratorial misinformation. The effect of the CDC correction on heuristic processing was heightened when it contained weak arguments. Notably, user-generated corrections with weak arguments reduced heuristic processing of the information and contributed to reducing the perceived credibility of the misinformation. Conclusion: Based on the findings, we argue that both communicator- and content-related cues jointly influence how audiences process corrective information.

After explaining the term ""cognitive vulnerability, "" we point out some epistemological implications of the approach, like the dependence of rationality patterns on changing belief networks and symbolic practices. Against this backdrop, we highlight how post-truth discourse, in interaction with psychological, technological, and ideological drivers, destabilizes the epistemic equilibrium of uncertainty, trust and responsibility, thus jeopardizing our epistemic practices and invalidating autoregulatory epistemic functions. The last three sections analyze the destabilizing dynamics in more detail, focusing on the polarization of the public sphere, the social perception of science, and the impact of post-truth discourse on standards of rationality and common sense.

Finally, the performance of HDNN is compared with six Machine Learning (ML) and five Deep Learning (DL) models.

The study was conducted through an online questionnaire survey consisting of closed-ended statements on a five-point Likert scale. Principal components analysis was performed on the collected data. The retained principal components (PCs) were subjected to non-hierarchical k-means cluster analysis to group respondents into clusters based on the similarity of perceived outcomes. A total of 840 responses were obtained. Twenty-eight original variables from the questionnaire were summarised into five PCs, explaining 63.0% of the total variance. The majority of respondents felt that the information they had received about the Russo-Ukrainian war was unreliable. Older, educated, professional people with exposure to fake news were sceptical about the reliability of information related to the war. Young adults who were active on social networks and had no detailed knowledge of the events considered information about the war to be reliable. The study found that the greater an individual’s ability to spot fake news, the lower their trust in social media and their information habits on social networks. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172170108"

While many factors contributing to the propensity for embracing conspiracy ideation have been delineated, the foremost determinant influencing individuals’ proclivity towards CT endorsement appears to be their level of educational attainment. This research aimed to assess the moderating effect of religiosity, trust in scientists, and political orientation on the impact of education level on people’s belief in COVID-19-related CTs in Europe by considering both individual-level and country-level contextual covariates of CT. We analysed data from the newest European Social Survey (ESS10) round conducted between September 2020 and September 2022 in 26 countries. We found religiosity weakens, and trust in scientists strengthens the effect of education, while the impact of political orientation is not straightforward. The result also demonstrates a significant negative correlation between the aggregate country-level data of the respondents supporting CTs and the level of vaccination and cumulative excess deaths in Europe. We concluded with a recommendation that planning effective public health strategies and campaigns are insufficient when based solely on people’s education, as individuals’ beliefs moderate the effect of education. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174820637"

In this study, I examined metacognitive efficiency - the extent to which the subjective feeling of knowing predicts the objective accuracy of knowledge - as a tool to understand and measure the assimilation of misleading misinformation in a balanced sample of Great Britain's population (N = 1689), surveyed at the end of the third national lockdown. Using a signal-detection theory approach to quantify metacognitive efficiency, I found that at the population level, metacognitive efficiency for COVID-19 knowledge was impaired compared with general knowledge, indicating a worse alignment between confidence levels and the actual ability to discern true and false statements. Crucially, individual differences in metacognitive efficiency related to COVID-19 knowledge predicted health-protective behaviours, vaccination intentions and attitudes towards public health measures, even after accounting for the level of knowledge itself and demographic covariates, such as education, income and political alignment. These results reveal the significant impact of misinformation on public beliefs and suggest that fostering confidence in accurate knowledge should be a key target for science communication efforts aimed at promoting compliance with public health and social measures.  © 2023 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171578822"

To that end, we conducted an experiment in 16 countries across 6 continents (N = 34,286; 676,605 observations) to investigate predictors of susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19, and interventions to combat the spread of this misinformation. In every country, participants with a more analytic cognitive style and stronger accuracy-related motivations were better at discerning truth from falsehood; valuing democracy was also associated with greater truth discernment, whereas endorsement of individual responsibility over government support was negatively associated with truth discernment in most countries. Subtly prompting people to think about accuracy had a generally positive effect on the veracity of news that people were willing to share across countries, as did minimal digital literacy tips. Finally, aggregating the ratings of our non-expert participants was able to differentiate true from false headlines with high accuracy in all countries via the ‘wisdom of crowds’.

Although most theorizing about the CIE attempts to explain why corrections do not eliminate belief in and influences of the misinformation, the present research takes a different approach and focuses instead on why corrections do reduce belief in misinformation (even if not entirely). We examined how a correction can change perceptions of the original source of the misinformation and how these changes in perceptions can mediate continued influence effects. We also examined causal evidence linking manipulations of misinformation source perceptions to continued belief and misinformation-relevant inferential reasoning. Study 1 demonstrated that an external correction (i.e., a new source labeling misinformation as false) influences perceptions of the misinformation source, and these perceptions of the misinformation source then correlated with belief in the misinformation. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1 and used source derogation to manipulate misinformation source perceptions and further lessen continued belief. Study 3 was a preregistered replication of previous results using new methodology. These studies suggest that perceptions of the misinformation source is one mechanism that can cause changes in belief in misinformation, and changes in the perception of a source can be achieved simply by correcting the source or through other means. This approach can be used to find other mechanisms responsible for reducing belief in misinformation. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151321137"

There are several approaches to address the detection of fake news. This work focuses on a hybrid approach based on functional linguistic features and machine learning. There are several recent works with this approach. However, there are no clear guidelines on which linguistic features are most appropriate nor how to justify their use. Furthermore, many classification results are modest compared to recent advances in natural language processing. Our proposal considers 88 features organized in surface information, part of speech, discursive characteristics, and readability indices. On a 42 677 news database, we show that the classification results outperform previous work, even outperforming state-of-the-art techniques such as BERT, reaching 99.99% accuracy. A proper selection of linguistic features is crucial for interpretability as well as the performance of the models. In this sense, our proposal contributes to the intentional selection of linguistic features, overcoming current technical issues. We identified 32 features that show differences between the type of news. The results are highly competitive in the classification and simple to implement and interpret. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168311758"

The scientific community has proposed several solutions to detect such fraudulent information. However, such solutions are unsuitable for social media posts since they cannot extract sufficient information from one-line textual and graphical content or are highly dependent on prior knowledge, which may be unavailable in the case of unprecedented events (e.g., breaking news). This paper tackles this issue by proposing HiPo, a novel multimodal historical post-based fake news detection method. By combining the features extracted from the graphical and textual content, HiPo assesses the truthfulness of a social media post by building its historical context from prior off-label posts with high similarity, therefore achieving online detection without maintaining a context or knowledge database. We evaluate the performance of HiPo via an exhaustive set of experiments involving four real-world datasets. Our method achieves a detection accuracy higher than 84%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most experimental instances. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Owing to the availability of deep fake generation algorithms at cheap computation power in cloud platforms, realistic fake videos or images are created. However, it is more critical to detect fake content because of the increased complexity of leveraging various approaches to smudge the tampering. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework to detect fake videos through the utilization of transfer learning in autoencoders and a hybrid model of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Recurrent neural networks (RNN).

In this study, we focused on contaminated mindware (conspiracy and paranormal beliefs) and investigated its relationship with both acceptance of and adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, along with other variables from the domains of emotion (trait anxiety, fear), traditional personality traits (Big 5, locus of control, optimism/pessimism) and motivation (self-control, dispositional regulatory focus). A total of 22 variables were measured in an online survey (N = 374) that took place during the second wave of COVID-19 (Nov. 2020 – March 2021) in Switzerland. Of all variables, the endorsement of specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was most strongly associated with lower acceptance and adherence to the preventive measures, together with mistrust in science and a more right-wing political orientation. In contrast, fear of COVID-19 and prevention regulatory focus were positively associated with acceptance and adherence. Our results therefore highlight the importance of fighting (conspiratorial) misinformation and of increasing the perceived credibility of science in reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Moreover, when acceptance was used as predictor for adherence, agreeableness and dispositional prevention regulatory focus still explained unique variance in adherence, suggesting that such personality and motivational variables play an important role in adhering and regulating preventive behaviour independent from the attitude towards the preventive measures themselves. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125521800"

Structurally, neoliberalism has involved privatization, deregulation, and government divestment from public health systems. Cultural psychologists have begun to outline the ways that neoliberalism is reflected in attitudes, ways of being, and ideologies, such as in the form of heightened individualism, justification of inequality, depoliticization, and precarity. We argue that neoliberal structures and psychologies may contribute to deleterious outcomes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that neoliberalism at the US state level (n = 51) is associated with higher COVID mortality and case fatality rates, as well as lower vaccination rates (Study 1). We also demonstrate that individual-level (n = 8280) neoliberal ideology predicts less adaptive beliefs and attitudes such as the belief that the federal response to the pandemic was too fast and belief in COVID-related misinformation (Study 2). We demonstrate using multilevel modeling that state-level neoliberalism predicts individual-level COVID-related attitudes, which is explained in part by heightened neoliberal ideology in more neoliberal states (Study 2).

In St. Louis, MO, we created iHeard STL, a community-level misinformation surveillance and response system. This paper reports methods and findings from its first year of operation. Methods We assembled a panel of over 200 community members who answered brief, weekly mobile phone surveys to share information they heard in the last seven days. Based on their responses, we prioritized misinformation threats. Weekly surveillance data, misinformation priorities, and accurate responses to each misinformation threat were shared on a public dashboard and sent to community organizations in weekly alerts. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between panel member characteristics and misinformation exposure and belief. Results In the first year, 214 panel members were enrolled. Weekly survey response rates were high (mean = 88.3% ± 6%). Exposure to a sample of COVID-19 misinformation items did not differ significantly by panel member age category or gender; however, African American panel members had significantly higher reported odds of exposure and belief/uncertain belief in some misinformation items (ORs from 3.4 to 17.1) compared to white panel members. Conclusions Our first-year experience suggests that this systematic, community-based approach to assessing and addressing misinformation is feasible, sustainable, and a promising strategy for responding to the threat of health misinformation. In addition, further studies are needed to understand whether structural factors such as medical mistrust underly the observed racial differences in exposure and belief. © 2023 Johnson et al.

However, different media organizations and fact-checkers have produced different sets of news domain quality ratings, raising questions about the reliability of these ratings. In this study, we compared six sets of expert ratings and found that they generally correlated highly with one another. We then created a comprehensive set of domain ratings for use by the research community (github.com/hauselin/domain-quality-ratings), leveraging an ensemble “wisdom of experts” approach. To do so, we performed imputation together with principal component analysis to generate a set of aggregate ratings. The resulting rating set comprises 11,520 domains-the most extensive coverage to date-and correlates well with other rating sets that have more limited coverage. Together, these results suggest that experts generally agree on the relative quality of news domains, and the aggregate ratings that we generate offer a powerful research tool for evaluating the quality of news consumed or shared and the efficacy of misinformation interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172355490"

However, concerns have been raised that corrections may introduce false claims to new audiences when the misinformation is novel. This is because boosting the familiarity of a claim can increase belief in that claim, and thus exposing new audiences to novel misinformation—even as part of a correction—may inadvertently increase misinformation belief. Such an outcome could be conceptualized as a familiarity backfire effect, whereby a familiarity boost increases false-claim endorsement above a control-condition or pre-correction baseline. Here, we examined whether standalone corrections—that is, corrections presented without initial misinformation exposure—can backfire and increase participants’ reliance on the misinformation in their subsequent inferential reasoning, relative to a no-misinformation, no-correction control condition. Across three experiments (total N = 1156) we found that standalone corrections did not backfire immediately (Experiment 1) or after a one-week delay (Experiment 2). However, there was some mixed evidence suggesting corrections may backfire when there is skepticism regarding the correction (Experiment 3). Specifically, in Experiment 3, we found the standalone correction to backfire in open-ended responses, but only when there was skepticism towards the correction. However, this did not replicate with the rating scales measure. Future research should further examine whether skepticism towards the correction is the first replicable mechanism for backfire effects to occur. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163864128"

This study investigates how conspiracy mentality may affect compliance with preventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the underlying emotional and cognitive mediators. Data was collected through a survey among 1878 Chinese respondents at the conclusion of the pandemic. The results indicate that individuals with higher levels of conspiracy mentality are significantly less engaged in preventive behaviors. Furthermore, this correlation is mediated by a sequence of mediating factors, starting from anger leading to institutional distrust and fear leading to perceived risk. Conspiracists’ response mode can be described as a state of ""attentive immobility,"" in which the impact of heightened institutional distrust outweighs their perceptions of risk, ultimately reducing engagement in preventive behaviors during crises. These findings underscore the importance of debunking initiatives that aim to address and mitigate the negative consequences of conspiracy mentality by targeting the mediating psychological processes during future pandemic threats. © 2023 Zhao et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177419618"

Although the state and associated health institutions should feasibly be sources of epistemic authority, the pandemic has undermined their legitimacy as anti-science rhetoric proliferated and ‘fake news’ spread rapidly. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of interviews with citizens across four different countries and explore how a lack of consistency and clarity in public health guidance from government and other trusted institutions led to a polarisation in public perceptions and mixed understandings of the pandemic. Using interview data collected across Brazil, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, we explored whether there were differences in the extent to which both state governments and scientific institutions were perceived as epistemic authorities through managing the pandemic. Participants grappled with a distrust of government guidelines, finding alternative sources of information to manage perceived infection risk, and make decisions around self-medication. Our analysis suggests several components were key to maintaining trust – and therefore epistemic authority – during the pandemic: reliability of the information delivered by different government bodies, including clarity of messaging; reliability of the government bodies themselves, including whether officials conducted themselves appropriately; and honesty about claims to expertise, including communicating when the scientific evidence was unclear or inconclusive. Our data suggests that honest communication about the limits of their knowledge would assist governments in engendering trust among citizens, and theoretically, compliance with public health guidelines. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165336254"

Specifically, we propose, at this aim, an intervention that centers on recognizing stereotypical beliefs and other media biases about a group of people in misleading news. To better understand the variables that contribute to improving socio-analytical performance in the face of such misinformation, we investigated the influence of implicit associations as a tendency toward the automatic labeling of groups, as well as two dimensions of perceived self-efficacy in the face of misinformation, one active and one inhibitory. Our results demonstrate the presence of a negative link between affective prejudice and socio-analytical processing, and that this analytical performance toward misleading news is negatively related to the individual tendency toward implicit activation, and is also explained by the inhibitory factor of the perceived efficacy toward misinformation. The role of the active factor related to the perceived ability of fact-checking is not significant. This research suggests that education focused on the socio-analytical processing of misleading news in social media feeds can be an effective means of intervening in online affective prejudice among adolescents; the implications and limitations of our findings for future research in this area are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173457249"

This study explores social factors associated with the belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing upon the theoretical framework of Max Weber, it posits that beliefs in conspiracy theories are linked to both instrumental rationality considerations, such as trust in health authorities, science, and pharmaceutical companies, as well as value-rationality based factors, such as ideological orientation. The study analyzes recent, nationally representative survey data and is the first to examine the social predictors of belief in conspiracy theories in Spain during the pandemic. The findings highlight that conspiracy theory beliefs are (a) associated with considerably worse vaccination behaviors, (b) not or only very weakly associated with standard demographics such as age, sex, or education, (c) related to instrumental rationality considerations, and (d) only weakly related to value-rationality indicators such as ideological and religious affiliations. In conclusion, the study underscores the significance of public health policies that specifically address conspiracy theory convictions, and to that end, advocates for the application of a Weberian sociological perspective to better understand the diverse rationalities underlying these beliefs, particularly in the absence of discernible demographic predictors. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173129880"

However, the results are in line with the synergistic integrative model as partisanship interacted with cognitive reflection: anti-government voters used their analytic capacities to question both concordant and discordant fake news more than pro-government voters.

Employing structural equation modeling, we not only examine these associations but also explore how trust and COVID-19 anxiety act as moderating variables in this context. Additionally, we delve into demographic factors such as age group, educational level, gender, and place of residence (governorate) to discern potential variations. Our findings reveal that trust in health experts is inversely related to belief in conspiracy theories, while trust in health experts negatively correlates with exposure to conspiracy and misinformation. Intriguingly, trust in health experts exhibits divergent effects across governorates: it diminishes conspiracy and misinformation beliefs in some regions but not in others. Exposure to personal contacts and digital media, on the other hand, is associated with heightened beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories, respectively, in select governorates. These distinctions may be attributed to proximity to Muscat, the capital city of Oman, where various media outlets and policy-making institutions are situated. Furthermore, lower educational attainment is linked to greater belief in conspiracy and misinformation. Females reported higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs and COVID-19 anxiety while no significant differences were detected in misinformation beliefs. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of misinformation and conspiracy theories in the context of COVID-19 in Oman, highlighting the pivotal roles of trust and COVID-19 anxiety as moderating factors.

We test the impact of three independent motives on people’s willingness to share CTs on social media: bolstering their or their group’s beliefs (motivated sharing), generating collective action against their political outgroup because of losing (sounding the alarm), and mobilizing others against the political system (need for chaos). Using an original survey of US adults (N = 3336), we test these three motives together and find strong evidence for motivated sharing and need for chaos, but no evidence for sounding the alarm. Our findings suggest that motivated sharing—when measured directly as belief in the CTs—is the strongest predictor of willingness to share CTs on social media. Need for chaos has less of an effect on sharing than belief but a consistently stronger effect on sharing than partisanship and ideology. Altogether, we demonstrate that sharing CTs on social media can serve both motivated and mobilizing functions, particularly for those who believe the CTs or seek to challenge the political system, rather than impugn their political rivals. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166571513"

Yet research on the emotional basis for misinformation susceptibility and how emotional appeals may help reduce COVID-19 related misperceptions remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a 2 (threat from COVID-19: yes vs. no) × 4 (correction conditions: none vs. factual correction vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook & individual efficacy vs. factual correction + words of optimistic outlook & collective efficacy) between-participant factorial experiment among an online sample of Chinese residents (N = 836) in June 2020. Misinformation about COVID-19 treatments and mitigation was presented in all conditions. Across five misinformation topics, threat information induced more misperceptions while all three types of corrections mitigated threat information's deleterious impact and improved belief accuracy. Importantly, corrections incorporating hope appeals showed enhanced effectiveness in improving belief accuracy when threat information was present whereas factual corrections absent hope appeals did not show similar sensitivity towards threat information. For hope appeal corrections, their indirect effects on desirable downstream behavioral intentions through corrected beliefs were stronger with than without preceding threat information. Our study thus demonstrated the potential of deploying hope appeals to fight the COVID-19 infodemic in China and beyond when threat information is prevalent, while highlighting the importance of studying the roles of emotional appeals in health misperception formation and correction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169804028"

We propose an outlier knowledge management framework of “generation–spread–identification–refutation” for detecting fake news in emergencies based on the theory of complex adaptive systems and information transmission. We extract and acquire outlier knowledge of COVID-19 fake news, incorporate it into the outlier knowledge base of major emergencies for knowledge sharing and transformation, classify the acquired knowledge from three dimensions (people, organization, and technology), and develop wisdom according to the extracted knowledge. Our proposed hybrid model is based on Convolutional Neural Network, Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Network, and Attention Mechanism (AM) for fake news detection, thereby improving the evaluation indicators of Loss, Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall by at least 1 %. The multi-head AM performs better in fake news detection when models with different AMs are adjusted, and significant differences in sentence length and topic distribution can be observed between real and fake news. The model provides a think tank and a platform for public opinion guidance to deal with major emergency news detection. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166217886"

Notably, there is currently no unified theoretical framework that addresses the questions of (1) how individuals discern whether political information is true or (deliberately) false, (2) under what conditions individuals are most susceptible to believing misinformation, and (3) how the structure of political and communicative environments skews cognitive processes of truth, discernment, and interpretation generation. To move forward, we propose the Misinformation Receptivity Framework (MRF). Building on Bayesian and probabilistic models of cognition, the MRF suggests that we can conceptualize misinformation receptivity as a cognitive inference problem in which the reliability of incoming misinformation is weighed against the reliability of prior beliefs. This reliability-weighting process can model when individuals adopt or reject misinformation, as well as the ways in which they creatively generate interpretations rather than passively discern truth versus falsehood. Moreover, certain communication contexts can lead people to rely excessively on incoming (mis)information or conversely to rely excessively on prior beliefs. The MRF postulates how such environmental properties can heighten the persuasiveness of different kinds of misinformation. For instance, the MRF predicts that noisy communication contexts, in which the reliability of inputs is ambiguous, make people susceptible to highly partisan and ideological misinformation or disinformation that amplifies their existing belief systems. By contrast, the MRF predicts that contextual instability renders people susceptible to misinformation that would be considered extreme or worldview-incongruent in conditions of stability. The MRF formally delineates the interactions between cognitive and communicative mechanisms, offering insights and testable hypotheses on when, how, and why different kinds of misinformation proliferate. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165504639"

Across three experiments, 1551 US-based online participants viewed fact checks (either health- or politics-related) with or without a quiz. Overall, the fact checks were effective, and participants were more accurate in rating the claims after exposure. In addition, quizzes improved participants’ memory for the details of the fact checks, even 1 week later. However, that increased memory did not lead to more accurate beliefs. Participants’ accuracy ratings were similar in the quiz and no-quiz conditions.

The results show that COVID-19 shared center stage with other topics in the health area. In addition, a unique agenda is evident in each situation in the study, indicating a fact-checking strategy that is differentiated according to the media outlet and type of specialization (generalist fact-checker or one specialized in health). Vaccination, nutrition, and disease treatment emerge as the most important thematic subfields. Most health hoaxes are manufactured, i.e., created from scratch, rather than being manipulated or reconfigured from real preexisting elements. The format of text and image together predominates, and new social networks (TikTok or Telegram) have appeared as platforms for the circulation of hoaxes. This indicates that providing necessary health literacy to society and giving health issues greater presence in current fact-checking agendas are strategies for combatting disinformation, which can have serious consequences, regardless of whether there is a public health crisis such as the one experienced recently. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178301568"

A new approach recently proposed in scholarship and piloted on online platforms is to harness the wisdom of the crowd by enabling recipients of an online message to attach veracity assessments to it. The intention is to allow poor initial crowd reception to temper belief in and further spread of misinformation. We study this approach by letting 4000 subjects in 80 experimental bipartisan communities sequentially rate the veracity of informational messages. We find that in well-mixed communities, the public display of earlier veracity ratings indeed enhances the correct classification of true and false messages by subsequent users. However, crowd intelligence backfires when false information is sequentially rated in ideologically segregated communities. This happens because early raters’ ideological bias, which is aligned with a message, influences later raters’ assessments away from the truth. These results suggest that network segregation poses an important problem for community misinformation detection systems that must be accounted for in the design of such systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146958067"

Our results show that endorsers performed worse than non-endorsers on the CRT, but they took significantly longer to answer the questions and did not make proportionally more intuitive mistakes.

Artificial intelligence-based methods of altering videos and photos (deepfakes) lower the barriers to the mass creation and dissemination of realistic, manipulated digital content. The risk of exposure to deepfakes among education stakeholders has increased as learners and educators rely on videos to obtain and share information. We field the first study to understand the vulnerabilities of education stakeholders to science deepfakes and the characteristics that moderate vulnerability. We ground our study in climate change and survey individuals from five populations spanning students, educators, and the adult public. Our sample is nationally representative of three populations. We found that 27–50% of individuals cannot distinguish authentic videos from deepfakes. All populations exhibit vulnerability to deepfakes which increases with age and trust in information sources but has a mixed relationship with political orientation. Adults and educators exhibit greater vulnerability compared to students, indicating that those providing education are especially susceptible. Vulnerability increases with exposure to potential deepfakes, suggesting that deepfakes become more pernicious without interventions. Our results suggest that focusing on the social context in which deepfakes reside is one promising strategy for combatting deepfakes. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168353580"

Additionally, PNFS significantly positively predicted the use of problem and emotion-focused coping strategies and did not predict dysfunctional coping mechanisms.

In this intervention, participants were endowed with an expert role and requested to write a letter to their digitally less competent relatives explaining six strategies that help fake news recognition. Compared to the active control group there was an immediate effect (d = 0.32) that persisted until the follow-up four weeks later (d = 0.22) on fake news accuracy ratings of the young, advice-giving participants. The intervention also reduced the bullshit receptivity of participants both immediately after the intervention and in the long run.

It advances an emotion-centered approach to understanding misinformation by examining how different conceptualizations of emotions, such as core affect and dimensional approaches, discrete emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety, fear), feelings-as-information, and intuition, are applied to investigate the spread and belief of false information online. The chapter also discusses how emotions impact the effectiveness of corrections to falsehoods. It concludes with a call to place more emphasis on emotions in misinformation research, offering a series of unanswered questions about emotion and misinformation to be addressed in future work. Together, the chapter offers a comprehensive overview for why and how emotions can promote public misinformation about key social issues. © Oxford University Press 2023.

A segment of the population, which we call the Self-Wise, seems to exhibit an inflated sense of self-expertise relative to domain experts, which – combined with a lack of trust in the latter – leads them to ignore or reject expert advice. We argue and demonstrate that this phenomenon is distinct from other “illusory superiority” phenomena, most notably Dunning-Kruger and Lake Wobegon. Three studies with US participants provide compelling evidence for the existence of the Self-Wise phenomenon. In the context of COVID-19, its behavioral consequences are non-compliance with expert-based COVID-19 guidelines and measures (e.g., wearing a mask and getting vaccinated). The studies also provide insight into additional characteristics of the Self-Wise, which can be used for identification and targeting purposes. We tested the effectiveness of two tailored interventions that aimed at reducing this segment's “illusory superiority” and (re-)establishing their trust in medical experts. The interventions proved effective in terms of reducing the “illusory superiority” of the Self-Wise, and generally enhanced the participants' intention to comply with COVID-19 guidelines. However, to substantially change the non-conforming COVID-19 behavior of the Self-Wise likely requires stronger and sustained mitigation strategies or interventions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170435406"

This has affected many vulnerable communities in Brazil. The ability to understand and sort out pieces of reliable information and fake news has become a fundamental cognitive skill. In this study we report on the development of a serious game (a card-based role-playing game) using Brazilian folk heroes aimed to develop critical thinking skills to empower vulnerable communities affected by misinformation and fake news. Four groups located in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) participated in this research: one group of people experiencing homelessness; two groups of favela residents (one urban and one in the suburbs) and one group of recyclable material collectors from a cooperative. We gained entry and built trust with each of these groups and worked together for 10 months during the pandemic. We conducted participatory observations, individual interviews with each participant and discussed their daily interaction with information, specifically in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. The analyses of the observations and interview data gave us a glimpse of the communicative needs of the groups. Inserting players into a narrative where they can make decisions based on critical thinking and their own reflections on the pandemic was important for building knowledge and developing critical thinking in these communities. The nature of the game (interactive and cooperative) allowed participants to focus on problem-solving skills and group work. It encouraged them to use real-life knowledge and skills to solve the fictional problems presented by the narrative. © 2023","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163465854"

In this game, players take on the role of the misinformation spreader, intending to add more followers to their virtual accounts using different strategies. A total of 180 Chinese participants were randomly assigned to game-based inoculation, graphic-based inoculation, and control groups. The results indicated that both types of inoculation interventions significantly decreased the perceived credibility and sharing intention of misinformation. Game-based inoculation was more effective than graphic-based inoculation in terms of misinformation perceived credibility, and the intervention effects were stable after 2 weeks.

Disinformation campaigns framing renewables as unreliable are driven by two factors: the increasing frequency of power outages and the growing pressures facing fossil fuel energy stakeholders. Over the past decade, power outages in the United States have doubled, primarily due to increased extreme weather, aging energy infrastructure, and a rapidly changing resource mix. At the same time, the energy transition is placing unprecedented competitive pressure on the coal and gas industry and on the nation’s utilities. These factors are driving fossil fuel stakeholders and their allies to increasingly make renewables the scapegoat for large-scale blackouts and other grid-related challenges. As the scapegoating after recent power outages in Texas and California shows, such disinformation campaigns can shift blame for grid failures away from responsible parties, bolster policies that perpetuate the nation’s reliance on carbon-heavy energy sources and justify unwarranted investments in outdated energy infrastructure. This article highlights this trend and its adverse impacts and suggests several potential strategies for addressing it, including government-sponsored information campaigns and the possibility of creating a new federal agency focused on promoting accuracy and transparency in energy-related messaging. © 2023, University of New Mexico.

Many academics have expressed fears that deepfakes present a severe threat to the veracity of news and political communication, and an epistemic crisis for video evidence. These commentaries have often been hypothetical, with few real-world cases of deepfake’s political and epistemological harm. The Russo-Ukrainian war presents the first real-life example of deepfakes being used in warfare, with a number of incidents involving deepfakes of Russian and Ukrainian government officials being used for misinformation and entertainment. This study uses a thematic analysis on tweets relating to deepfakes and the Russo-Ukrainian war to explore how people react to deepfake content online, and to uncover evidence of previously theorised harms of deepfakes on trust. We extracted 4869 relevant tweets using the Twitter API over the first seven months of 2022. We found that much of the misinformation in our dataset came from labelling real media as deepfakes. Novel findings about deepfake scepticism emerged, including a connection between deepfakes and conspiratorial beliefs that world leaders were dead and/or replaced by deepfakes. This research has numerous implications for future research, societal media platforms, news media and governments. The lack of deepfake literacy in our dataset led to significant misunderstandings of what constitutes a deepfake, showing the need to encourage literacy in these new forms of media. However, our evidence demonstrates that efforts to raise awareness around deepfakes may undermine trust in legitimate videos. Consequentially, news media and governmental agencies need to weigh the benefits of educational deepfakes and pre-bunking against the risks of undermining truth. Similarly, news companies and media should be careful in how they label suspected deepfakes in case they cause suspicion for real media. © 2023 Twomey et al.

The role of political leaders in this process has attracted less research attention, even though politicians who ‘speak their mind’ are perceived by segments of the public as authentic and honest even if their statements are unsupported by evidence. By analysing communications by members of the US Congress on Twitter between 2011 and 2022, we show that politicians’ conception of honesty has undergone a distinct shift, with authentic belief speaking that may be decoupled from evidence becoming more prominent and more differentiated from explicitly evidence-based fact speaking. We show that for Republicans—but not Democrats—an increase in belief speaking of 10% is associated with a decrease of 12.8 points of quality (NewsGuard scoring system) in the sources shared in a tweet. In contrast, an increase in fact-speaking language is associated with an increase in quality of sources for both parties. Our study is observational and cannot support causal inferences. However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the current dissemination of misinformation in political discourse is linked to an alternative understanding of truth and honesty that emphasizes invocation of subjective belief at the expense of reliance on evidence. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172444815"

This study delves into the verbal and nonverbal linguistic strategies employed to influence the cognitive background of Saudis as well as their ideological beliefs in a way that targets a shift in their attitudinal behavior, socially, politically, and religiously. The paper analytically covers two linguistic dimensions of using language to influence others, either persuasively or manipulatively: the lexical level, which focuses on the lexical choices of particular words that serve to create a specific attitudinal shift in the recipients’ personalities, and the pragmatic level, which constitutes the intended meaning of speakers or writers that lies beyond the surface propositional meaning of the linguistic expression. To achieve its objective, the paper draws on two analytical strands: critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the social cognitive theory (SCT). The paper has three main findings: first, language is a rhetorical device for influencing the public’s political, social, and religious views, and, therefore, the rhetorical power of the word significantly contributes to attitudes shift; second, misinformation propagated via social networks influences the attitudinal behavior of recipients, particularly at the social level; and, third, social platforms are ideology conduits via which various meanings targeting attitudes shift are communicated. © World Journal of English Language.All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178399991"

Gamified “inoculation” interventions have shown promise in improving people’s ability to recognize manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation, but so far few interventions exist that tackle multimodal misinformation (e.g., videos, images). We developed a game called Cat Park, in which players learn about five manipulation techniques (trolling, emotional manipulation, amplification, polarization, and conspiracism), and how misinformation can spread through images. To test the game’s efficacy, we conducted a conceptual replication (N = 380) of Roozenbeek and van der Linden’s 2020 study about Harmony Square, with the same study design, item set, and hypotheses. Like the original study, we find that people who play Cat Park find misinformation significantly less reliable post-gameplay (d = 0.95, p < 0.001) compared to a control group, and are significantly less willing to share misinformation with people in their network (d = 0.54, p < 0.001). These effects are robust across different covariates. However, unlike the original study, Cat Park players do not become significantly more confident in their ability to identify misinformation (p = 0.204, d = − 0.13).

Recent research on finding check-worthy claims and automated fact-checking have made significant advancements. However, limited guidance exists regarding the presentation of fact-checked content to effectively convey verified information to users. We address this research gap by exploring the critical design elements in fact-checking reports and investigating whether credibility and presentation-based design improvements can enhance users' ability to interpret the report accurately. We co-developed potential content presentation strategies through a workshop involving fact-checking professionals, communication experts, and researchers. The workshop examined the significance and utility of elements such as veracity indicators and explored the feasibility of incorporating interactive components for enhanced information disclosure. Building on the workshop outcomes, we conducted an online experiment involving 76 crowd workers to assess the efficacy of different design strategies. The results indicate that proposed strategies significantly improve users' ability to accurately interpret the verdict of fact-checking articles. Our findings underscore the critical role of effective presentation of fact reports in addressing the spread of misinformation. By adopting appropriate design enhancements, the effectiveness of fact-checking reports can be maximized, enabling users to make informed judgments. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The public also has lost much of its confidence in the institutions designed to adjudicate those epistemic debates. To counter this threat, civic entrepreneurs have devised institutional reforms to revitalize democratic policymaking. One promising intervention is the Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR), which has been adopted into law in Oregon and tested in several other states, as well as Switzerland and Finland. Each CIR gathers a demographically stratified random sample of registered voters to form a deliberative panel, which hears from pro and con advocates and neutral experts while assessing the merits of a ballot measure. After four-to-five days of deliberation, each CIR writes an issue guide for voters that identifies key factual findings, along with the most important pro and con arguments. This study pools the results of survey experiments conducted on thirteen CIRs held from 2010 to 2018, resulting in a dataset that includes 67,120 knowledge scores collected from 10,872 registered voters exposed to 82 empirical claims. Analysis shows that reading the CIR guide had a positive effect on voters’ policy knowledge, with stronger effects for those holding greater faith in deliberation. We found little evidence of directional motivated reasoning but some evidence that reading the CIR statement can spark an accuracy motivation. Overall, the main results show how trust in peer deliberation provides one path out of the maze of misinformation shaping voter decisions during elections. © 2023 Gastil et al.

However, the distinction between active and passive use of social media, although important in explaining a variety of users’ behaviours, has been overlooked in terms of its potential to predict key socially relevant outcomes like beliefs in conspiracy theories. In three studies (N = 1388, in total), we provide evidence on (a) the role of passive social media use in believing in conspiracy theories via personal relative deprivation; (b) the interaction effect between social media use and personal relative deprivation on beliefs in conspiracy theories. The results showed that passive social media use is linked to, and increases, beliefs in conspiracy theories and this relationship is partially mediated via increased personal relative deprivation (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 3, personal relative deprivation was also manipulated experimentally in the context of a ʻmoderation-of-process' design, yielding a significant interaction with social media use.

The present study aimed to explore the perceptions, beliefs and information around post-mortem donation and will expression in different groups of the Italian population, to orient future interventions and raise awareness. Design: Qualitative research with focus groups. Methods: A total of 38 focus groups involving 353 participants including the general population (young adults: 18–39, mature adults: 40–70), local and hospital health professionals, critical area health professionals (emergency room and intensive care), registry office employees and opinion leaders, were conducted in six regions from different parts of Italy between June and November 2021. Thematic analysis was conducted with the use of Atlas.ti9. Results: Five overarching themes were identified: dilemmas regarding donation, resistance to donation, facilitators of donation, difficulties in terms of will expression and proposals to encourage will expression. Possible facilitators were having personal and professional experiences with organ donation, feeling useful for society, having reliable information and trust in the health care system. Potential barriers to donation were doubts and fears about brain death, bodily integrity concerns, religious beliefs, misinformation and distrust in the health care system. Conclusions: These results highlighted the significance of a bottom-up perspective with regard to identifying the personal perceptions and beliefs with regard to donation, underlining the urgency of creating tailored interventions to sensitize different groups of the population in terms of promoting an informed choice and a culture of donation. © 2023 The Authors.

In these environments, populist politicians use “fake news” and “anti-elitist” attacks to undermine the credibility of news messages. This article argues that to truly understand the impact of these criticism cues, one must simultaneously consider additional contextual cues as well as individual-level moderators. In a factorial survey, we exposed 715 respondents to tweets by a politician retweeting and discrediting a news message of which topic and source varied. We find that both the fake news cue and the anti-elitist cue have limited across-the-board effects but decrease credibility if the message is incongruent with voters’ issue positions. Our results thus offer a more optimistic view on the power of populist media criticism cues and suggest that source and confirmation heuristics are (still) stronger influences on citizens’ credibility evaluations. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162699203"

Their gender bias is assessed through the Word Embedding Association Test. The performance of co-reference resolution and text classification models trained on both original and debiased embeddings is evaluated in terms of accuracy. A compressed co-reference resolution model is examined to gauge the effectiveness of debiasing techniques on resource-efficient models. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply compression techniques to debiased models.

Jennifer Lackey argues in The Epistemology of Groups that a group agent is responsible for such deception. She analyzes this deception as a group lie, which involves a group misrepresenting its own beliefs through a jointly accepted assertion or a spokesperson. Against this view, I argue that the group responsible for disinformation campaigns is a diffuse network. This deception involves misrepresenting scientific knowledge, not a group belief. Taking tobacco industry disinformation campaigns as an example, I argue that these corporate groups needed a network of epistemically authoritative sources—including scientists, doctors, and reputable publishers—to create and spread disinformation in order to make a skeptical view of scientific knowledge appear credible. As such, I argue that a network is epistemically responsible for this deception. First, I challenge the assumption within group epistemology that assertion is the basis of epistemic responsibility and argue that credibility enhancement is the basis instead. This explains how non-testimonial forms of support and corroboration from multiple sources can bolster the apparent credibility of an implausible view. Next, I describe the roles of different corroborators to show why it is necessary to include them. Finally, I defend a network model of epistemic responsibility for deception. Understanding how enhancing the credibility of disinformation is a matter of responsibility can help us to build more trustworthy communities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168479102"

Earlier studies found that repetition increases truth judgments of factual statements, whether they are uncertain, highly implausible, or fake news, for instance. Would this ""truth effect"" be observed with conspiracy statements? If so, is the effect size smaller than the typical truth effect, and is it associated with individual differences such as cognitive style and conspiracy mentality? In the present preregistered study, we addressed these three issues. We asked participants to provide binary truth judgments to conspiracy and factual statements already displayed in an exposure phase (an interest judgment task) or that were new (displayed only in the truth judgment task). We measured participants' cognitive style with the three-item Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), and conspiracy mentality with the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ). Importantly, we found that repetition increased truth judgments of conspiracy theories, unmoderated by cognitive style and conspiracy mentality. Additionally, we found that the truth effect was smaller with conspiracy theories than with uncertain factual statements, and suggest explanations for this difference.

Using the framework of truth criteria to guide the online questionnaire and focus group, the researchers gathered the different perspectives of three age groups: Group 1 aged 19–38, Group 2 aged 39–54, and Group 3 aged 55 or above. The findings reveal that: (1) Group 3 agrees that translated news should be compatible with their existing, verified knowledge; (2) respondents in different age groups have significantly different opinions when assessing the coherence of news translations; (3) Group 1 is the most critical when looking for the credibility of news sources; (4) Group 1 is more likely than older groups to make time to verify translated news through social consensus; and (5) Group 1 is the most active in their search for supporting evidence. The decision to verify the news translation is influenced by time constraints, family relationships, technology, and the ease of information processing.

Studies have shown that false claims about vaccines that use emotive personal narratives are more likely to be shared and engaged with on social media than factual evidence-based public health messages. The aim of this study was to explore parents’ views regarding the use of positive narratives to promote childhood vaccination. Methods We identified three *4-minute video narratives from social media that counter frequent parental concerns about childhood vaccination: parents and informed decision-making (online misinformation about vaccines); a paediatrician’s clinical experience with vaccine-preventable diseases (prevention of still existing diseases); and a mother’s experience with vaccine-preventable disease (risks of the disease). Focus group discussions were held with parents of children aged 0 to 5 years to assess their views on these three narratives and their general opinion on the use of narratives as a vaccine promotion intervention. Results Four focus groups discussions were virtually held with 15 parents in December 2021. In general, parents trusted both health care provider’s and parent’s narratives, but participants identified more with stories having a parent as the main character. Both narratives featuring personal stories with vaccine-preventable diseases were preferred by parents, while the story about informed decision-making was perceived as less influential. Parents expressed the need for reliable and nuanced information about vaccines and diseases and felt that a short video format featuring a story was an efficient vaccine promotion intervention. However, many mentioned that they generally are not watching such videos while navigating the Web. Conclusion While vaccine-critical stories are widely shared online, evidence on how best public health could counter these messages remains scarce. The use of narratives to promote vaccination was well-perceived by parents. Future studies are needed to assess reach and impact of such an intervention. © 2023 Dubé et al.

Specifically, the study focuses on two correction strategies: source-based correction and relational approaches. Source-based approaches combatting misinformation prioritize sharing accurate information from trustworthy sources to encourage audiences to trust reliable information over false information. On the other hand, relational approaches give priority to developing relationships or promoting dialogue as a means of addressing misinformation. In this study, we surveyed 416 scientists from U.S. land-grant universities using a self-report questionnaire. We find that scientists' engagement in science communication activities is positively related to their intention to correct misinformation using both strategies. Moreover, the scientists' attitude towards misinformation mediates the relationship between engagement in communication activities and intention to correct misinformation. The study also finds that the deficit model perception-that is, the assumption that scientists only need to transmit scientific knowledge to an ignorant public in order to increase understanding and support for science-moderates the indirect effect of engagement in science communication activities on behavioral intention to correct misinformation using relational strategies through attitude towards misinformation. Thus, the deficit model perception is a barrier to engaging in relational strategies to correct misinformation. We suggest that addressing the deficit model perception and providing science communication training that promotes inclusive worldviews and relational approaches would increase scientists' behavioral intentions to address misinformation. The study concludes that scientists should recognize their dual positionality as scientists and members of their community and engage in respectful conversations with community members about science. © 2023 Choi et al.

I will argue that there is no new or growing problem of excessive falsehood (variously referred to as the problem of “misinformation” or “fake news”). Furthermore, we should reject the very idea that falsehood as such is a problem, and hence we should reject the idea of coming up with public policy responses to this so-called problem. I argue that the idea that falsehood is a problem is a natural consequence of the idea that it is virtuous to love truth and hate falsehood.

Effective rebuttal of contrarian arguments requires an approach that goes beyond addressing flaws in the arguments, by also considering the attitude roots—that is, the underlying psychological attributes driving a person’s belief—of opposition to vaccines. Here, through a pre-registered systematic literature review of 152 scientific articles and thematic analysis of anti-vaccination arguments, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy that relates common arguments and themes to 11 attitude roots that explain why an individual might express opposition to vaccination. We further validated our taxonomy on coronavirus disease 2019 anti-vaccination misinformation, through a combination of human coding and machine learning using natural language processing algorithms. Overall, the taxonomy serves as a theoretical framework to link expressed opposition of vaccines to their underlying psychological processes.

Our insights also build on prior cognitive and personality literature by exploring how this mechanism is conditional upon users’ cognitive ability and narcissism traits. The results suggest that social media fatigue can influence false beliefs of misinformation which translates into sharing on social media. We also find that those with high levels of cognitive ability are less likely to believe and share misinformation.

Vaccine hesitancy, influenced by various vaccine-related factors, significantly impacts the adoption of COVID-19 vaccination. Misinformation contributes to vaccine distrust and hinders individuals' willingness to receive the vaccine. Despite its critical importance, there remains a paucity of comprehensive studies focusing on the determinants of vaccine confidence, leading to a deficiency in implementation research aimed at understanding and modifying individuals' behavior towards COVID-19 vaccination. This research endeavors to examine the influence of three key dimensions of trust in the COVID-19 vaccine, namely vaccine reliability, transparency in information dissemination, and pharmaceutical laboratory investment in innovation, on individuals' intention to receive the vaccine. Furthermore, we investigate the repercussions of these dimensions on actual COVID-19 vaccination behavior. Our quantitative study comprises a sample of 240 participants and employs a rigorous analytical approach. The findings underscore that individuals' intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 is positively affected by all three trust dimensions, i.e., drug reliability, innovation investment, and information transparency. Importantly, this intention positively correlates with actual vaccination behavior. This study substantiates the utility of the behavioral approach and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in elucidating vaccine hesitancy and the factors exerting influence on vaccine uptake. © 2023 The Authors.

A pile of efforts has been put forward to address the problem with high accuracy, while most of them lack convincing explanations, making it difficult to curb the continued spread of false news in real-life cases. Although some models leverage external resources to provide preliminary interpretability, such external signals are not always available. To fill in this gap, in this work, we put forward an interpretable fake news detection model IKA by making use of the historical evidence in the form of graphs. Specifically, we establish both positive and negative evidence graphs by collecting the signals from the historical news, i.e., training data. Then, given a piece of news to be detected, in addition to the common features used for detecting false news, we compare the news and evidence graphs to generate both the matching vector and the related graph evidence for explaining the prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both Chinese and English datasets. The experiment results show that the detection accuracy of IKA exceeds the state-of-the-art approaches and IKA can provide useful explanations for the prediction results. Besides, IKA is general and can be applied on other models to improve their interpretability. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This rapid advancement can cause panic and chaos as anyone can easily create propaganda using these technologies. Hence, a robust system to differentiate between real and fake content has become crucial in this age of social media. This paper proposes an automated method to classify deep fake images by employing Deep Learning and Machine Learning based methodologies. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) based systems employing handcrafted feature extraction fail to capture more complex patterns that are poorly understood or easily represented using simple features. These systems cannot generalize well to unseen data. Moreover, these systems are sensitive to noise or variations in the data, which can reduce their performance. Hence, these problems can limit their usefulness in real-world applications where the data constantly evolves. The proposed framework initially performs an Error Level Analysis of the image to determine if the image has been modified. This image is then supplied to Convolutional Neural Networks for deep feature extraction. The resultant feature vectors are then classified via Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbors by performing hyper-parameter optimization.

This paper will focus on two different risks epistemic agents face online: being exposed to fake news and epistemic flooding. While the first risk is widely known and has been extensively discussed in the philosophical literature, the notion of ‘epistemic flooding’ is a novel concept introduced in this paper. Epistemic flooding occurs when epistemic agents find themselves in epistemic environments in which they are routinely confronted with more information and evidence than they can diligently process. Epistemic flooding is one of the most significant risks epistemic agents run while using social media and one of the reasons why the first risk (being exposed to fake news) is especially pernicious. It is particularly harmful if one ascribes to the Spinozan model of belief acquisition in which belief comes easy. Mitigating the combined threat of fake news and epistemic flooding requires us to think normatively about our epistemic environments and how to better them. This paper turns to the normative framework of epistemic environmentalism in order to accomplish this. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172372503"

In this study, we experimentally test how debunking text structure (truth sandwich vs. bottom-heavy) and headline format (statement vs. questions) affect the belief in misinformation across topics of the safety of COVID vaccines and GMO foods. Design: Experimental online study. Methods: A representative German sample of 4906 participants were randomly assigned to reading one of eight debunking messages in the experimentally varied formats and subsequently rated the acceptance of this message and the agreement to misinformation statements about the mentioned topics and an unrefuted control myth. Results: While the debunking messages specifically decreased the belief in the targeted myth, these beliefs and the acceptance of the debunking message were unaffected by the text structures and headline formats. Yet, they were less successful when addressing individuals with strong pre-existing, incongruent attitudes and distrust in science. Conclusions: The risk of backfire effects in debunking misinformation is low. Text structure and headline format are of relatively little importance for the effectiveness of debunking messages. Instead, writers may need to pay attention to the text being comprehensive, trustworthy and persuasive to maximize effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors.

With fast-paced online content generation, has come the challenging problem of fake news content. Consequently, automated systems to make a timely judgment of fake news have become the need of the hour. The performance of such systems heavily relies on feature engineering and requires an appropriate feature set to increase performance and robustness. In this context, this study employs two methods for reducing the number of feature dimensions including Chi-square and principal component analysis (PCA). These methods are employed with a hybrid neural network architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model called FakeNET. The use of PCA and Chi-square aims at utilizing appropriate feature vectors for better performance and lower computational complexity. A multi-class dataset is used comprising ‘agree’, ‘disagree’, ‘discuss’, and ‘unrelated’ classes obtained from the Fake News Challenges (FNC) website. Further contextual features for identifying bogus news are obtained through PCA and Chi-Square, which are given nonlinear characteristics. The purpose of this study is to locate the article’s perspective concerning the headline. The proposed approach yields gains of 0.04 in accuracy and 0.20 in the F1 score, respectively. As per the experimental results, PCA achieves a higher accuracy of 0.978 than both Chi-square and state-of-the-art approaches. Copyright: © 2023 Aljrees et al.

The development of procedures and techniques for drift detection, interpretation, and adaptation is central to concept-drift research. Data research has demonstrated that machine learning in a concept-drift environment produces poor learning results if drift is not handled. This study focuses on defining the concept-drift detection index to predict when the performance of a machine learning model for text-stream classifiers is low. It proposes an index that relies on the Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis theory. The index exploits the formal lattice to understand whether new incoming facts (e.g., news) are well represented in the training data used to build the machine-learning model. Fake news was deemed ideal for testing this new measure because its typical application scenario required handling a stream of unstructured content and concept-drift awareness. Experiments on three news datasets revealed a relevant correlation (i.e., 73.9 %, 80.8 %, and 81 %) between the Accuracy of Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Passive Aggressive (PA) models, respectively, and the proposed index. This strong correlation suggests that the new index can avoid incorrect classifications and help in retraining decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162838875"

Therefore, identifying predictors and motives for both behaviors is of importance. Here, we study the decisions made by a cross-national sample in randomized hypothetical scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that mask-wearing was predicted by empathic tendencies, germ aversion, and higher age, whilst belief in misinformation and presentation of an interaction partner as a family member lowered the safety standards. The main motives associated with taking the mask off included: rationalization, facilitating interaction, and comfort. Vaccination intention was positively predicted by empathy, and negatively predicted by belief in misinformation and higher costs of the vaccine. We found no effect of immunization status of the surrounding social group. The most common motive for vaccination was protection of oneself and others, whereas undecided and anti-vaccine groups reported doubts about the effectiveness and fear of side effects. Together, we identify social and psychological predictors and motives of mask-wearing behavior and vaccination intention.

One important aspect of this work that receives less attention than it should is exactly why misinformation is a problem. To adequately address this question, we must first look to its speculated causes and effects. We examined different disciplines (computer science, economics, history, information science, journalism, law, media, politics, philosophy, psychology, sociology) that investigate misinformation. The consensus view points to advancements in information technology (e.g., the Internet, social media) as a main cause of the proliferation and increasing impact of misinformation, with a variety of illustrations of the effects. We critically analyzed both issues. As to the effects, misbehaviors are not yet reliably demonstrated empirically to be the outcome of misinformation; correlation as causation may have a hand in that perception. As to the cause, advancements in information technologies enable, as well as reveal, multitudes of interactions that represent significant deviations from ground truths through people’s new way of knowing (intersubjectivity). This, we argue, is illusionary when understood in light of historical epistemology. Both doubts we raise are used to consider the cost to established norms of liberal democracy that come from efforts to target the problem of misinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148418072"

Works of the prominent academicians in the area of manipulation studies constitute the theoretical framework of this research. Empirical research methods such as observation, comparison, generalization and expert evaluation are used. First of all, types and methods of psychological influences used by mass media and social networks with a view to manipulate public opinions are distinguished. Moreover, the impact of emotions on the critical perception of the news is highlighted. The indicators of manipulative influence are defined in order to resist them. Besides, the ways of creating and distributing false information are described. In addition, the development of fakes identification mechanisms is considered a priority for the governmental and other public institutions. This is illustrated by a range of technologies developed to automatically detect fake news. Apart from that, the degrees of the information reliability are explored. Furthermore, structural elements of fake messages, which include the source and the message itself, are discussed. Misinformation of the public, promotion of certain opinions, encouragement of aggressive actions and instalment of doubts are singled out as the main tasks of fake information. Additionally, stages of countering fakes are distinguished. Finally, the specific features of the forensic expertise procedure are determined in order to provide information security in Ukraine.

We developed a single-item prototype measure of leadership styles and recruited participants from four Western democratic countries (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, N = 501) who identified their immediate boss as an autonomous, paternalistic, or authoritarian leader. Then they were asked to evaluate the accuracy of several fake news articles and their expectations to agree with their boss when asked about these articles. People with authoritarian bosses were less accurate in spotting fake news (Cohen’s d = 0.32) compared to employees with autonomous bosses. The bigger effect, however, was that they would agree with their boss about the fake news article when it was shared by their authoritarian boss compared to employees with autonomous (Cohen’s d = 1.30) or paternalistic bosses (Cohen’s d = 0.70). We argue that in addition to effects on the perceived accuracy of information, social influence, conformity, and obedience are crucial and unacknowledged factors of how misinformation may be maintained and propagated by authoritarian leaders. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167372051"

Two complementary studies examined the influence of perceived minority status on susceptibility to misinformation and conspiracy beliefs. In study 1 (n = 2140), the perception of belonging to a minority group, rather than factually belonging to it, was most consistently related with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation across national samples from the USA, the UK, Germany and Poland. Specifically, perceiving that one belongs to a gender minority group particularly predicted susceptibility to misinformation when participants factually did not belong to it. In pre-registered study 2 (n = 1823), an experiment aiming to manipulate the minority perceptions of men failed to influence conspiracy beliefs in the predicted direction. However, pre-registered correlational analyses showed that men who view themselves as a gender minority were more prone to gender conspiracy beliefs and exhibited a heightened conspiracy mentality. This effect was correlationally mediated by increased feelings of system identity threat, collective narcissism, group relative deprivation and actively open-minded thinking. Especially, the perception of being a minority in terms of power and influence (as compared to numerically) was linked to these outcomes.

This would bring financial and reputational incentives for engagement, which might lead users to post more objectionable content. Previous research showed that financial or reputational incentives for accuracy decrease the willingness to share misinformation. However, it is unclear to what extent such outcome would change if engagements instead of accuracy were incentivized, which is a more realistic scenario. To address this question, we conducted a survey experiment to examine the effects of hypothetical token incentives. We find that a simple nudge about the possibility of earning token-based points for the achieved user engagements increases the willingness to share different kinds of news, including misinformation. The presence of penalties for objectionable posts diminishes the positive effect of tokenization rewards on misinformation sharing, but it does not eliminate it.

In this context, popular social media users play a major role, as they have the ability to broadcast messages to large audiences and influence public opinion. In this article, we make use of openly available data to study the behavior of popular users discussing the pandemic on Twitter. We tackle the issue from a network perspective, considering users as nodes and following relationships as directed edges. The resulting network structure is modeled by embedding the actors in a latent social space, where users closer to one another have a higher probability of following each other. The results suggest the existence of two distinct communities, which can be interpreted as “generally pro” and “generally against” vaccine mandates, corroborating existing evidence on the pervasiveness of echo chambers on the platform. By focusing on a number of notable users, such as politicians, activists, and news outlets, we further show that the two groups are not entirely homogeneous, and that not just the two poles are represented. To the contrary, the latent space captures an entire spectrum of beliefs between the two extremes, demonstrating that polarization, while present, is not the only driver of the network, and that more moderate, “central” users are key players in the discussion. © The Author(s) 2023.

In this paper, I argue that an excess of humility also plays a role in allowing for the spread of misinformation. Citing experimental evidence, I show that inducing intellectual humility causes people inappropriately to lower their confidence in beliefs that are actually justified for them. In these cases, they manifest epistemic humility in ways that make them epistemically worse off. I argue that epistemic humility may fail to promote better beliefs because it functions for us against the background of our individualistic theory of responsible epistemic agency: until we reject such theories, intellectual humility is as much a problem as a solution to epistemic ills. Virtue epistemology is inadequate as a response to unjustified beliefs if it does not look beyond the virtues to our background beliefs. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170561260"

However, few literacy scales can evaluate students' fake news reporting and checking abilities. In the past, the new media literacy framework only included Critical Consuming, Critical Prosumption, Functional Prosumption, and Functional Consuming. Therefore, this study proposes a self-assessable new online media and reporting literacy scale (NOMRL) based on the previous new media literacy framework. The NOMRL scale was developed in four phases. A literature review generated a pool of items in the first phase. Phase 2 was conducted through an expert review to confirm the validity of the content. Phase 3 was the purification of the scale in Study 1, where 243 university students participated in this survey phase. Finally, we analyzed 365 university students' responses in Study 2 and derived a factor structure using EFA while conducting a reliability assessment with CFA to test the theoretical structure. This study resulted in a 22-item scale, including two new constructs: Behavioral Consumption and Behavioral Prosumption. The scale can help college students self-assess their level of reporting-related literacy in social media.

This qualitative study assessed the motivations, beliefs, and perceptions of individuals who have decided to remain unvaccinated against COVID-19.

To assess this question, we conducted 18 interviews with unvaccinated adults throughout 2021–2022. The interviews consisted of 20 questions regarding participants' perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and their intentions to get vaccinated.

The consequences of this phenomenon can be serious, both for the individual and at a social and political level. To alleviate this situation, different agencies recommend healthy practices regarding consumption and exchange of information; from checklists to self-learning exercises for the development of critical thinking. This research proposes a tool for the identification of behaviours among adolescents when giving credibility to information or content and the motives that lead them to share it, contributing at times to the spread of misleading information. After an exhaustive process of design, piloting, and psychometric validation using an English-speaking sample (N = 417), a reliable instrument was obtained. We also measured its correlation with critical thinking and moral disengagement. The results lead us to conclude that this is a new tool with which to observe the information consumption behaviours of young people and thus measure their vulnerability to disinformation. Similarly, we have confirmed how greater critical thinking is positively re-lated to more responsible consumption when giving credibility to content or news, and how moral disengagement is linked to the fact of sharing such items with greater ease. © 2023, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Across two studies, we first distinguish false memories from false beliefs and expressive responses; false political memories appear to be genuine and subject to partisan bias. We also examine the political and psychological correlates of false memories. Nearly a third of respondents reported remembering a fabricated or factually altered political event, with many going so far as to convey the circumstances under which they “heard about” the event.

It is widely interpreted as reflecting readers' effective ""validation"" of text coherence. However, there are also numerous phenomena of readers' deficient validation, sometimes collectively labelled ""misinformation effects."" This study asked whether readers become consciously aware of the text discrepancies diagnosed by the consistency effect. Experiment 1 scrutinized (a) conspicuous conceptual inconsistencies and (b) character-trait inconsistencies. It replicated the consistency effect both at a critical target sentence and at a subsequent sentence (spillover). Experiment 2 replaced self-paced reading with consistency judgments about the target sentences. The subjects overlooked almost half of the inconsistencies, thus denying that readers reliably become aware of consistency-effect discrepancies. In Experiment 3, the former target sentences were reframed as explicit questions. Accuracy for inconsistencies was statistically indistinguishable from accuracy for consistent targets, favoring the interpretation that Experiment 2 subjects overlooked known, encoded discrepancies. The results are interpreted with reference to Kintsch's (Psychological Review, 95, 163-182, Kintsch, 1988; Comprehension. New York: Cambridge University Press, Kintsch, 1998) construction-integration model, a refinement of which adds an immediate, passive stage of validation processing to construction and integration.

In two experiments, participants viewed an image of an innocent suspect in the time between viewing a mock-crime video and completing a lineup procedure. The imagewas presented in the context of a social media search or a police mugbook viewing. A control group viewed no photos of innocent people before the lineup. The same images were used in the mugbook and social media conditions, but the social media profiles were designed so that the innocent suspect stood out as the only person who had mutual friends with the participant. In both experiments, the innocent suspect was more likely to be mistakenly identified if they were previously viewed on social media relative to the control condition. The mugshot viewing also increased innocent suspect identifications, but only after the plausibility of the innocent suspect was increased in Experiment 2. Relative to the control condition, participants who viewed either a mugbook or socialmedia had lower accuracy when they identified the suspect with high confidence. These findings indicate that viewing images of innocent people can contaminate the memory of eyewitnesses, influence identifications at a subsequent lineup procedure, and undermine the eyewitness confidence–accuracy relation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184878299"

Detection of fake news is essential in the modern society. Complex models are used in the analysis of data by ML classification algorithms, which accurately detect incorrect information. This safeguards integrity and gives people the confidence to rely on reliable sources. Fake news threatens democracy, diminishes public trust, and intensifies polarisation. Transformer models like M-BERT, ALBERT, BERT, and XLNET were used in this task, and notably, M-BERT surpassed the competition with a strong F1 score of 0.74, while XLNET and ALBERT only managed 0.71 and 0.66 accuracy respectively.

Infographics are often shared on Instagram, but they harbour the potential for misinformation. Users do not always research posts before sharing, and the social nature of the site influences user behaviour. Current digital literacy theories highlight the need to integrate digital technologies into traditional information literacy theories, because technologies are increasingly central to everyday life and information consumption. In this article, I investigated digital literacy from a user perspective, examining how users’ digital literacy skills interact with their sharing of infographics. I also examined how infographics are used for activism, and the social and visual affordances of Instagram, which helped to dictate the users’ relationship with digital literacy. I conducted a qualitative study consisting of interviews with six participants. Participants were asked about their Instagram behaviour, infographic selection, and how they judge the reliability of an infographic before sharing. Participant responses were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Responses revealed that users are familiar with traditional concepts of information literacy, such as referencing sources, but often prioritise other areas, such as the social and personal contexts of an infographic when deciding what to share. Users also dialogue with online followers using visual imagery and activism. These sharing practices are contextualised within Instagram affordances and the behaviours the platform enables and constrains. The study is novel in examining digital literacy as enacted through Instagram, specifically the use of infographics, while also foregrounding the user perspective. The results emphasise the need to consider user perspectives in digital literacy whether conducting research or teaching. © 2023, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

Researchers have highlighted that social communication often embodies nonverbal behavior. A forensic interviewer’s nonverbal behavior, such as gesturing during an interview, could communicate misleading information and may cause inaccuracies in the interviewees’ testimonies. The current study was conducted in Switzerland and included 108 child participants, in three age groups (a younger sample aged 6–9 years, n = 32) (a middle sample aged 10–11 years, n = 40) and an older sample aged 12–13 years, n = 36). Participants viewed a video and completed an interview about the video, individually, immediately after. During the questioning, the interviewer deliberately misled the interviewees with nonverbal gestures. The results showed that 95 children were misled by at least one gesture and that gestures led to a significant decrease in accuracy. Children also incorporated misleading gestures and reported false information; adding to existing evidence that misinformation can also be communicated through nonverbal gestures. Our findings demonstrate the negative influence of misleading gestures in child eyewitness interviews and provide more evidence for the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect, reported in previous research. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146891609"

Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre–post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond “true” or “fake”) from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment).We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more “false” responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154582248"

Methodology: This paper analyses the journalistic sources-from the indicators of number, identification and typology-used in 420 articles on the coverage of COVID-19 corresponding to four journalistic professional models: traditional press, digital native media, popular press and verification platforms. Results: The analysis reflects an adequate management of sources by the Spanish press during the coverage of the pandemic, mostly using a higher than standard number of sources; identifying them correctly in almost all cases; and using an adequate variety. Therefore, despite the clear predominance of official sources, there is also a notable presence of expert sources from the scientific and health fields. Discussion and conclusions: The quality of source management has contributed to fighting disinformation in the Spanish press, although there are important differences between professional models. Verification platforms are those with the highest quality standards when managing their information sources, which helps to reinforce key criteria in the fight against disinformation, such as verification, relevance, credibility and transparency. © 2023, University of La Laguna.

In the United States, for instance, PHBs emerged as (and remain) a partisan issue. The current work examines partisan gaps in PHB by considering both informational and perceptual factors related to COVID-19. Specifically, we focus on politically motivated belief in COVID-19 (mis)information and simultaneously consider the roles of physical threat and disgust perception. We find that poor performance in misinformation accuracy judgments and subsequently lower COVID-19 threat perceptions sequentially predict less PHB engagement. In Study 1 (N = 87 US undergraduate students), higher conservatism predicted lower COVID-19 threat perceptions but not COVID-19 disgust perceptions. Study 2 (N = 168 US undergraduate students) replicated this effect, while demonstrating that the relationship between stronger conservatism and lower engagement in PHB was mediated by higher accuracy judgments of COVID-19 misinformation and, in turn, lower perceptions of COVID-19 threat but not disgust. This suggests that considering threat perception is essential to understanding how politically motivated endorsement of COVID-19 misinformation shapes PHB. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147035574"

Social media platforms are experimenting with different interventions to curb fake news' spread, often employing them simultaneously. However, research investigating the interaction of these interventions is limited. Here, we use the heuristic-systematic model of information processing (HSM) as a theoretical framework to jointly test two interventions against fake news that are implemented at scale by social media platforms: (1) adding warning labels from fact checkers to initiate systematic processing and (2) removing social endorsement cues (e.g., engagement counts) to reduce the influence of this heuristic cue. Moreover, we accounted for dispositions previously found to affect a person's response to fake news through motivated reasoning or cognitive style. An online experiment in Germany (N = 571) confirmed that warning labels reduced the perceived credibility of a fake news post exaggerating the consequences of climate change. Warning labels also lowered the (self-reported) likelihood to amplify fake news. Removing social endorsement cues did not have an effect. In line with research on motivated reasoning, left-leaning individuals perceived the climate fake news to be more credible and reported a higher likelihood to amplify it. Supporting research on cognitive style, participants with lower educational levels and a less analytic thinking style also reported a higher likelihood of amplification. Elaboration likelihood was associated only with age, involvement, and political leaning, but not affected by warning labels. Our findings contribute to the mounting evidence for the effectiveness of warning labels while questioning their relevance for systematic processing. © 2023 The Authors.

A prominent line of research suggests that these beliefs are promoted by repeated exposure. Yet, as scholars have rushed to understand these beliefs, they have exposed countless respondents to conspiratorial claims, raising the question of whether researchers are contributing to their spread. We investigate this possibility using a pre-registered within-subjects experiment embedded in a panel survey. The results suggest that exposure to a standard conspiracy question causes a significant increase in the likelihood of endorsing that conspiracy a week later. However, this exposure effect does not occur with a question format that offers an alternative, non-conspiratorial explanation for the target event. Thus, we recommend that researchers reduce the likelihood of spreading conspiracy beliefs by adopting a question format that asks respondents to choose between alternative explanations for an event.  © The Author(s), 2023.

But why do citizens contribute to the dissemination of falsehoods online? This article investigates this question by focusing on the role of motivated reasoning and, in particular, perceptions of group-based conflict. It examines the effect of perceived conflict on the endorsement of false news in the context of a regional conflict between Russia and the West as experienced by Ukrainian citizens. In our survey experiment, a sample of Ukrainians (N = 1,615) was randomly assigned to read negative false news stories about Russia, the European Union or Tanzania–a country with no stakes in the conflict. The results show that higher perceived conflict between Ukraine and Russia makes Ukrainians less likely to endorse false news targeting the European Union, but more likely to endorse false news that paint a negative picture of Russia. This finding extends the support for motivated reasoning theory beyond Western contexts investigated so far. Importantly, the effects of conflict perceptions remain strong after controlling for group identity and political knowledge of participants. These results advance our understanding of why false information is disseminated and point to the importance of conflict deescalation to prevent the diffusion of falsehoods. © 2023 Mazepus et al.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among ordinary citizens. In addition to demographic and vaccine-related information, a five-point Likert scale was used to measure vaccine-related misinformation beliefs and how to counter them. Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationship between demographic variables and vaccine acceptance. A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify vaccine hesitancy by different demographic groups. Nonparametric Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed to determine the significance of difference between demographic groups in terms of their vaccine-related misinformation beliefs. Finally, the total misinformation score was computed to examine the correlation between vaccine hesitancy and the total score. Findings: This study found that nearly half of the respondents were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine, whereas more than one third of the participants were unsure about taking the vaccine. Demographic variables (e.g., gender, age and education) were found to be significantly related to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that respondents who were below 40 years of age, females and those who had lower education attainments had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. There were significant differences in participants’ vaccine-related misinformation beliefs based on their demographic characteristics, particularly in the case of educational accomplishments. A highly significant negative correlation was found between total misinformation score and vaccine acceptance. Research limitations/implications: The survey was conducted online, and therefore, it automatically precluded non-internet users from completing the survey. Further, the number of participants from villages was relatively low. Overall, the results may not be representative of the entire population in Bangladesh. Practical implications: The findings of this paper could guide government agencies and policymakers in devising appropriate strategies to counter COVID-related misinformation to reduce the level of vaccine hesitancy in Bangladesh. Originality/value: To the authors’ best knowledge, this study is the first to measure the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and the influence of misinformation in this process among the general public in Bangladesh. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117473635"

Early reports emphasized the unusual heterogeneity of these protests: Hippies and esoterics marched alongside conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazis. We examined what these protestors might (andmight not) have in common. A large study with antilockdown protestors in Germany (N = 1,700) revealed four subgroups: centrists, politically undifferentiated, left-wingers, and right-wingers. Beyond that, these subgroups demonstrated striking similarities: All endorsed conspiracy beliefs, misinformation, esotericism, and vaccine hesitancy to a similar extent.

However, some research suggests that when numerate people hold extreme worldviews they could use their skills to engage in motivated (biased) reasoning about controversial topics like climate change, further polarizing their judgments and beliefs. While suggestive, previous numeracy studies on this topic have neglected the highly influential role of knowledge in skilled judgment and decision making (see Skilled Decision Theory; Cokely et al., 2018). To address this limit, we conducted two studies with diverse (n = 537) and probabilistically representative samples (n = 305) of U.S. residents, testing the first integrated cognitive model of the relations between numeracy, worldviews, knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions. Structural modeling revealed that regardless of people’s worldviews, numeracy was not associated with polarization or enhanced bias. However, numeracy was consistently related to more accurate climate change knowledge, which was by far the strongest predictor of accurate beliefs (e.g., 6–10 times stronger than people’s worldviews), largely mediating the associations between worldviews and risk perceptions (e.g., individualists were less informed and less concerned about climate change). Consistent with the risk literacy Knowledge is Power account, results suggest that when accurate risk knowledge is available numeracy skills may generally promote more informed and therefore less biased judgment and decision making, even when people are confronted with controversies and conflicts of interest. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186488630"

This paper examines the negative consequences of neoliberal self-care discourses related to COVID-19 that contributed to the disinfodemic, focusing on the wellness industry. Some health gurus and wellness instructors promoted lifestyle adjustments and self-care to prevent contracting the virus and sometimes blamed COVID-19 patients for contracting it. These claims contributed to vaccine hesitancy and pseudo-scientific beliefs. The misinformation was attractive partly because it promised individual control and independence from mainstream (scientific) advice. These discourses existed before the pandemic but were amplified within the wellness community after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Historically, science education has rested on two premises. The first is that it is possible for students to acquire sufficient scientific knowledge from K-12 education to become intellectually independent. That is that science education can produce individuals capable of evaluating scientific evidence and arguments critically for themselves. This belief is what underlies many of the conceptions of scientific literacy and is the basis of the rationale that is used to sustain and justify what is offered in nearly all countries across the globe. The second is the belief that the science that students will encounter will have been filtered such that it can be trusted. Nothing today could be further from the truth. Today, misinformation abounds and much of it purports to be scientific. Very few conceptions of scientific literacy have considered how students can be prepared to evaluate the claims that abound on social media. Current conceptions of “scientific literacy,” we argue, are failing to articulate the competencies and knowledge required in today's changed context. In what follows, we lay out our arguments for why it is time to rethink the conception of scientific literacy by considering what it requires to be a competent outsider to science. Then drawing on our recent report, we lay out what might be done within science education to address the specific phenomenon of misinformation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150623291"

Given the rapid and easy access to information, news stories quickly go viral, the vast majority of which are misleading and with no prospect of verification. Specifically, the headline of a correctly designed news item must correspond to a summary of the main information of that news item and it should be neutral. However, many headlines circulating on the Internet use false or distorted information, seeking to confuse or mislead the reader. Misleading headlines indicate a dissonance between the headline and the content of the news story. From a computational perspective, this problem is being tackled as a Stance Detection problem between the headline and the body text of the news item. This paper contributes to the fight against the spread of misleading information by presenting a generic and flexible multi-level hierarchical classification. The approach is based on two stages that enable the detection of the stance between the news headline and the body text. The proposed architecture, called HeadlineStanceChecker+ uses the headline and only the essential information of the news item (not the full body text) as inputs. To extract this essential information, different summarization approaches (extractive and abstractive) are analyzed in order to determine the most relevant information for the task. The experimentation has been carried out using the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) dataset. A 94.49% accuracy was obtained using extractive summaries, which were more helpful than abstractive ones. HeadlineStanceChecker+ improves the accuracy results of existing state-of-the-art systems. In conclusion, using automatic extractive summaries together with the two-stage generic architecture is an effective solution to the problem. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150879912"

The two groups participated in a 30-minute-long text-based learning intervention: either about informal fallacies or about fake news. Learning about informal fallacies enhanced participants’ ability to identify fallacious arguments one week later.

We examine how variations in the sources and messaging strategies of these public statements affect respondents’ beliefs about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We analyzed the results of an experiment embedded within a multi-wave survey deployed to US and UK respondents in January–February 2022 to examine these effects. We employ a test-retest between-subjects experimental protocol with a control group. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions reflecting discrete pairings of message source (political authorities vs. healthcare professionals) and messaging strategy (debunking misinformation vs. discrediting mis-informants) or a control condition. We use linear regression to compare the effects of exposure to treatment conditions on changes in respondent beliefs about the potential risks associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Results: In the UK sample, we observe a statistically significant decrease in beliefs about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines among respondents exposed to debunking messages by healthcare professionals. We observe a similar relationship in the US sample, but the effect was weaker and not significant. Identical messages from political authorities had no effect on respondents’ beliefs about vaccine risks in either sample. Discrediting messages critical of mis-informants likewise had no influence on respondent beliefs, regardless of the actor to which they were attributed. Political ideology moderated the influence of debunking statements by healthcare professionals on respondent vaccine attitudes in the US sample, such that the treatment was more effective among liberals and moderates than among conservatives. Conclusions: Brief exposure to public statements refuting anti-vaccine misinformation can help promote vaccine confidence among some populations. The results underscore the joint importance of message source and messaging strategy in determining the effectiveness of responses to misinformation. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151568610"

This paper looks at some underexplored implications and outcomes of Ernst Gombrich’s conceptual schemata when such a schemata is applied to cartoons. While we might easily avoid defamatory reference when picking out a subject in writing or speech, cartoon depictions, especially those unaccompanied by speech bubbles or captions, often rely on a visual symbolism typified by the warping of some features the removal of others, and the manifestation of some visual trope or other, more easily lend themselves to defamatory reference. While harms to the referent are many in cases of defamatory cartoons, this paper focuses on the harms to the viewers of such cartoons by the depicter’s message and mode of representation, unique to the cartoon form. I will focus on the harms of misinformation of the viewer by the visual schemata (Gombrich 1960) present in certain cartoons, and the way this misinformative visual schemata (Ibid) may also restrict the possibility of conceptual revisions in its viewership. Harms of this kind come out uniquely in cartoons via norms of cartooning (as a particularly stylized and symbolic mode of visual representation) and the norms of interaction employed in the act of viewing a cartoon. As we’ll see in our case study of the infamous Jyllands Posten cartoons of Muhammad the Prophet, even in cases where a cartoon representation bears no visual similarity to its referent, viewers can easily and reliably pick out the referent by calling to mind, in our focal case, the defamatory stereotypes, stock figures and icons inextricably linked with the referent. I argue that the damage to viewers of these sorts of depictions lies not in the fact that the viewer manages to pick out the intended referent of the depiction but what tools they use to pick out the referent and how such tools of reference (mis)inform their understanding of the referent they’ve picked out. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146740500"

Previous research (Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019a, 2019b) has indicated that playing the “Bad News” game, in which a player spreads fake news to gain followers, reduces people's belief in fake news. The goal of the present paper was to test an analogous new game called “COVID-19 Bad News (CBN)” to improve one's eagerness to vaccinate against coronavirus. CBN was constructed to examine whether creating and disseminating fake news focused on vaccinations and the COVID-19 pandemic has a similar effect and improves people's attitudes toward vaccination. Two experiments were conducted where participants played CBN or Tetris and afterwards evaluated the credibility of statements about vaccines against COVID-19 and finally filled out a questionnaire concerning their attitudes toward vaccination. The results show that playing CBN does not reduce evaluations of the credibility of all statements that are unfavorable to vaccines (false as well as true). Additionally, it does not enhance readiness to vaccinate.

Research has shown that individuals persevere in their biased beliefs and opinions even after the retraction of misinformation. This phenomenon is known as the belief perseverance bias. However, research on mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation has been limited. Only a few debiasing techniques with limited practical applicability have been proposed, and research on comparing various techniques in terms of their effectiveness has been scarce. This paper contributes to research on mitigating the belief perseverance bias after the retraction of misinformation by proposing counter-speech and awareness-training techniques and comparing them in terms of effectiveness to the existing counter-explanation technique in an experiment with N = 251 participants. To determine changes in opinions, the extent of the belief perseverance bias and the effectiveness of the debiasing techniques in mitigating the belief perseverance bias, we measure participants’ opinions four times in the experiment by using Likert items and phi-coefficient measures. The effectiveness of the debiasing techniques is assessed by measuring the difference between the baseline opinions before exposure to misinformation and the opinions after exposure to a debiasing technique. Further, we discuss the efforts of the providers and recipients of debiasing and the practical applicability of the debiasing techniques. The CS technique, with a very large effect size, is the most effective among the three techniques. The CE and AT techniques, with medium effect sizes, are close to being equivalent in terms of their effectiveness. The CS and AT techniques are associated with less cognitive and time effort of the recipients of debiasing than the CE technique, while the AT and CE techniques require less effort from the providers of debiasing than the CS technique. © 2023 Siebert, Siebert.

The study found that the presence of data visualization in news articles correcting misperceptions significantly enhanced the reduction of misperceptions among news readers with less than average prior knowledge about an issue. In addition, it was found that prior beliefs had a significant effect on news readers’ misperceptions regardless of the presence or absence of data visualization.

In the context of defamation law, courts try to set a standard that balances the interests of speakers and their potential targets. This article empirically demonstrates an unappreciated effect of such decisions on third parties: a credibility effect. Using a series of lab experiments, I find that defamation law makes individuals more trusting of reports from various media. This credibility effect is desirable when the report is true but can lead to unintended consequences in the case of misinformation. In particular, the credibility effect is shown to cast a stigma on innocent targets who choose not to file lawsuits. The existence of the credibility effect calls for different balances than are currently employed in defamation law; challenges the vindication justification; and, more broadly, illustrates the limits of policies intended to fight misinformation. © 2023 by The University of Chicago.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151281513"

Understanding the factors that lead social media users to amplify (or indeed intervene in) the spread of this content is an ongoing challenge. Prior research suggests that users are not only more likely to interact with misinformation that supports their ideology or their political beliefs, they may also feel it is more acceptable to spread. However, less is known about the influence of newer, issue-specific beliefs. Two online studies explored the relationship between the degree of belief-consistency of disinformation on users’ moral judgements and intentions to spread disinformation further. Four disinformation narratives were presented: disinformation that supported or undermined the UK Government’s handling of COVID-19, and disinformation that minimised or maximised the perceived risk of COVID-19. A novel scale for measuring intentions to contribute to the spread of social media content was also used in study 2. Participants reported greater likelihood of spreading false material that was consistent with their beliefs. More lenient moral judgements related to the degree of belief-consistency with disinformation, even when participants were aware the material was false or misleading. These moral judgements partially mediated the relationship between belief-consistency of content and intentions to spread it further on social media. While people are concerned about the spread of disinformation generally, they may evaluate belief-consistent disinformation differently from others in a way that permits them to spread it further. As social media platforms prioritise the ordering of feeds based on personal relevance, there is a risk that users could be being presented with disinformation that they are more tolerant of. © 2023 Joyner et al.

AOT scales are strong predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks and of the avoidance of reasoning traps such as superstitious thinking and belief in conspiracy theories. Nevertheless, AOT is most commonly measured with questionnaires rather than performance indicators. Questionnaire contamination becomes even more of a danger as the AOT concept is expanded into new areas such as the study of fake news, misinformation, ideology, and civic attitudes. We review our 25-year history of studying the AOT concept and developing our own AOT scale. We present a 13-item scale that both is brief and accommodates many previous criticisms and refinements. We include a discussion of why AOT scales are such good predictors of performance on heuristics and biases tasks. We conclude that it is because such scales tap important processes of cognitive decoupling and decontextualization that modernity increasingly requires. We conclude by discussing the paradox that although AOT scales are potent predictors of performance on most rational thinking tasks, they do not predict the avoidance of myside thinking, even though it is virtually the quintessence of the AOT concept. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148707265"

In three experiments, we investigate the influence of the credibility of the story’s narrator on the likelihood that readers encode and recall misinformation contained in the narrative. Participants read stories containing accurate real-world facts and misleading lures. The stories were narrated by either a credible or a non-credible narrator. Following the stories, participants were tested for the critical story information with a free response test of their general knowledge (Experiments 1 and 2) or with a speeded true-false test (Experiment 3). Overall, narrator credibility had no influence on readers’ memory for accurate information. However, readers were more likely to reproduce and affirm misinformation when it was delivered by a credible than a non-credible narrator.

We explored how division along these two dimensions interacts with the correction of political misinformation. Participants saw accurate and inaccurate statements (either balanced or mostly inaccurate) from two politicians from opposing parties but the same Brexit position (Experiment 1), or the same party but opposing Brexit positions (Experiment 2). Replicating previous work, fact-checking statements led participants to update their beliefs, increasing belief after fact affirmations and decreasing belief for corrected misinformation, even for politically aligned material. After receiving fact-checks participants had reduced voting intentions and more negative feelings towards party-aligned politicians (likely due to low baseline support for opposing party politicians). For Brexit alignment, the opposite was found: participants reduced their voting intentions and feelings for opposing (but not aligned) politicians following the fact-checks. These changes occurred regardless of the proportion of inaccurate statements, potentially indicating participants expect politicians to be accurate more than half the time. Finally, although we found division based on both party and Brexit alignment, effects were much stronger for party alignment, highlighting that even though new divisions have emerged in UK politics, the old divides remain dominant.  © 2023 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147556211"

Across 12 online experiments (N = 6,989), we examined decisions to share news touching on the divisive issues of gun control, abortion, gender and racial equality, and immigration. Myside sharing was systematically observed and was consistently amplified when participants (i) moralized and (ii) were attitudinally extreme on the issue. The amplification of myside sharing by moralization also frequently occurred above and beyond that of attitude extremity. These effects generalized to both true and fake partisan news. We then examined a number of interventions meant to curb myside sharing by manipulating (i) the audience to which people imagined sharing partisan news (political friends vs. foes), (ii) the anonymity of the account used (anonymous vs. personal), (iii) a message warning against the myside bias, and (iv) a message warning against the reputational costs of sharing ""mysided""fake news coupled with an interactive rating task. While some of those manipulations slightly decreased sharing in general and/or the size of myside sharing, the amplification of myside sharing by moral attitudes was consistently robust to these interventions. Our findings regarding the robust exaggeration of selective communication by morality and extremism offer important insights into belief polarization and the spread of partisan and false information online. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177174233"

The present study investigated the associations of political orientation with vaccine hesitancy and intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and the potential mediating roles of trust in science and belief in misinformation. A total of 750 Italian respondents completed an online questionnaire in the period between the second and the third wave of COVID-19 (from 9th March to 9th May 2021). The results showed that political orientation had both direct and indirect associations with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine intention, mediated by trust in science and belief in misinformation. Specifically, right-wing adherents were less trustful of scientists and believed in COVID-19-related misinformation more than left-wing adherents, and these two factors accounted for their higher vaccine hesitancy and reduced willingness to receive an anti-COVID-19 vaccination. Our findings are in line with the predictions of the mindsponge theory and suggest that communicative campaigns aimed at improving the rates of vaccine acceptance in right-wing adherents should be specifically focused on enhancing trust in science and reducing belief in misinformation. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159588607"

We also find no evidence of backfire effects occurring. However, subsequent analysis using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) finds significant heterogeneity within these treatment effects. While all advertisements were effective, each ad was effective in different ways despite common themes and content.

To explore this exposure, valenced framing theory is applied as a suitable framework where credibility and cognitive image are checked to be mediators in this relationship. This study adopted a perceived and projected image approach for online survey design, and a quantitative method was applied. The results depict that fake news frames have an indirect effect on a country's brand equity mediated by news credibility and cognitive image toward the country. We show that news credibility and cognitive image function as sequential mediators, meaning that the level of believability and cognitive preconceptions about a certain country directly affect country brand equity. Moreover, this study demonstrates that negatively framed fake news can affect all dimensions of country brand equity negatively, whereas positive fake news frames do not change people's perceptions significantly. According to the outcomes, we proved that the level of credibility is significantly influenced by the type of valenced fake news frame as well.

In this research (N = 2,476), we show that the structure of online sharing built into social platforms is more important than individual deficits in critical reasoning and partisan bias—commonly cited drivers of misinformation. Due to the reward-based learning systems on social media, users form habits of sharing information that attracts others' attention. Once habits form, information sharing is automatically activated by cues on the platform without users considering response outcomes such as spreading misinformation. As a result of user habits, 30 to 40% of the false news shared in our research was due to the 15% most habitual news sharers. Suggesting that sharing of false news is part of a broader response pattern established by social media platforms, habitual users also shared information that challenged their own political beliefs. Finally, we show that sharing of false news is not an inevitable consequence of user habits: Social media sites could be restructured to build habits to share accurate information.

These fault lines in the care of minority communities in the US have been further exacerbated by the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by race and ethnicity, particularly among African American and Latinx communities in Eastern Pennsylvania (PA). Methods Survey data was collected in July 2021 in Philadelphia, Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton, PA. The 203 participants (38.7% Black, 27.5% Latinx) completed the 28-question survey of COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in either English or Spanish. Result Out of the 203 participants, 181 participants met all the inclusion criteria, including completed surveys; of these participants, over three-fifths (63.5%) were acceptant of the COVID-19 vaccine whereas the remainder (36.5%) were hesitant. Binary logistic regression results showed that age, concern for vaccine efficacy, race, knowledge on the vaccine, and belief that the COVID-19 virus is serious significantly influenced COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Minorities were more likely to be hesitant toward vaccination (OR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8) than non-Hispanic whites. Those who believed the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective (OR: 8.3, 95% CI: 3.8, 18.2), and that the virus is not serious (OR: 8.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 61.8) showed the greatest odds of hesitancy. Conclusions Minority status, age less than 45 years, misinformation about seriousness of COVID-19 illness, and concern about vaccine efficacy were contributing factors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, understanding and addressing the barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in minority groups is essential to decreasing transmission and controlling this pandemic, and will provide lessons on how to implement public health measures in future pandemics.  © 2023 Colvin et al.

This chapter clarifies how the Japanese government (including local governments) from the Taisho era (1910s-1920s) to recent years have attempted to respond to man-made crises involving phenomena such as disinformation, rumors, and panics that tend to be triggered after natural disasters or war and consider the challenges that have existed in each period. The cases discussed in this chapter are the Great Kanto, Hanshin-Awaji, and East Japan earthquakes, several typhoons and earthquakes, and war disasters (air raids in Japan during World War II). Results of the analysis, this chapter concludes that although there will inevitably be information gaps to some extent at the time of a disaster, overcoming these gaps always involves a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It will be increasingly important for governments to be aware of these issues and to consider recovery methods. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Yasuhiro Takeda, Jun Ito, Yusuke Kawashima; individual chapters, the contributors.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180734503"

Nowadays, the accuracy of information in all types of media is less important than the number of clicks and views per media content. Due to the fact that there is a proven correlation between the level of media literacy and democratic development of a society, as well as the fact that the media have a great influence on the shaping of public opin-ion via media framing and agendas, this paper explores the awareness on media literacy of Twitter users in Croatia (primarily journalists) and their perception of their own consumption and dissemination of fake news across social networks and traditional mass media. Although Twitter is not popular in Croatia, it is intensively used by Croatian journalists, and tweets often serve as topics for media processing, which gives Twitter great importance in creating the Croatian media discourse. The research was conducted by encouraging a discussion and undertaking further content analysis of tweets regarding the role of media literacy in combating the impact of fake news, especially on social networks. This was followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with six journalists who are active Twitter users and content analysis of articles on media literacy and fake news available on Croatian web portals. Triangulation was used in order to reduce the echo chamber effect on the results of the study. The research has shown that respondents, i.e. Twitter users in Croatia – including journalists – are not sufficiently informed about media literacy and its impact on combating fake news. It has also pinpointed their lack of awareness regarding their own consumption and dissemination of fake news across social networks and mass media. The objective of the research was to create a model for analyzing the interrelationship between media literacy and creating fake news from two perspectives: (1) evaluating self-perception of Twitter users via content analysis and in-depth interviews, and (2) analyzing media publications on the topic of media literacy and fake news, whose content reflects the perception of the media on these topics. © 2023, Doron Fakultet Politickih Znanosti.

However, little is known about the experiences, knowledge, and feelings of Brazilian women in this period. The objective was to analyze the experiences of women, seen at maternity hospitals accredited by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS, acronym in Portuguese), regarding health care during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum periods, their interpersonal relationships, and perceptions and feelings about the pandemic. This was a qualitative, exploratory research, carried out in three Brazilian municipalities with women hospitalized in 2020, during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum period, with COVID-19 or not. For data collection, semi-structured individual interviews (in person, by telephone, or by digital platform) were conducted, recorded and transcribed. The content analysis of thematic modalities was displayed as per the following axes: i) Knowledge about the disease; ii) Search for health care in prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum periods; iii) Experience of suffering from COVID-19; iv) Income and work; and v) Family dynamics and social support network. A total of 46 women were interviewed in São Luís-MA, Pelotas-RS, and Niterói-RJ. Use of media was important to convey information and fight fake news. The pandemic negatively impacted access to health care in the prenatal, childbirth, and postpartum periods, contributing to worsening of the population’s social and economic vulnerabilities. Women experienced diverse manifestations of the disease, and psychic disorders were very frequent. Social isolation during the pandemic disrupted the support network of these women, who found social support strategies in communication technologies. Women-centered care–including qualified listening and mental health support–can reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases in pregnant, parturient, and postpartum women. Sustainable employment and income maintenance policies are essential to mitigate social vulnerabilities and reduce risks for these women. © 2023 Lamy et al.

Social media allows people to spread information on the internet with slight investigations and to add fewer filters than the actual content. Nowadays, the false news in the internet community is unsure, and it creates a wrong impression among the users. Detecting false news has become a critical task based on shared content. To tackle the false news growth in social media, various automatic detection schemes were evaluated. The “Natural Language Processing (NLP)” method also gives a prominent solution for false news detection. The main intention of this paper is to design and introduce an innovative false news recognition method using Meta-heuristic Searched-Ensemble Learning (MS-EL). Further, the selected features are extracted by the “Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)” and also Word2vec features. Here, the extracted selected features are integrated with the Hybrid Squirrel–Dragonfly Search Optimization (HS-DSO) is used to optimize the weighted feature selection approach with the fitness function of solving data variance and correlation. The proposed MS-EL is adopted in the classification part, having three sets of classifiers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Here, the ensemble classifier is enhanced by the same HS-DSO that shows the parameter tuning with a high convergence rate. From the experimental outcomes, the accuracy of HS-DSO-MS-EL is 22% higher than BMO-MS-EL, 24% higher than SP-BMO-MS-EL, 30% higher than SSA-MS-EL, and 29% higher than DA-MS-EL. Thus, the experimental analysis with standard datasets establishes that the introduced fake news detection method has gained higher accuracy than the existing models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145782702"

We use the rating to compare rhetorical strategies for discrediting opponents as sources during rival information campaigns about the Equal Rights Amendment. We show claiming the opponent is spreading disinformation rather than misinformation (stating the opponent is spreading falsehoods deliberately, rather than unwittingly) appears more effective at discrediting, particularly when disinformation claims allege more sinister motives for lying.

In one study, social endorsement enticed a higher accuracy rating of news posts. In both studies, people judged attitudinally congruent news posts as being more accurate and reported a higher likelihood to share them.

In particular, many argue that the context of social media itself may make people susceptible to the influence of false claims. Here, we test that claim by asking whether simply considering sharing news on social media reduces the extent to which people discriminate truth from falsehood when judging accuracy. In a large online experiment examining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and political news (N = 3157 Americans), we find support for this possibility. When judging the accuracy of headlines, participants were worse at discerning truth from falsehood if they both evaluated accuracy and indicated their sharing intentions, compared to just evaluating accuracy. These results suggest that people may be particularly vulnerable to believing false claims on social media, given that sharing is a core element of what makes social media “social.” Copyright © 2023 The Authors, some rights reserved;","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149436728"

Participants that consulted official data following exposure to misinformation (N = 43) did not differ from participants exposed solely to misinformation in regard to the level of worry about terrorism (N = 43). Similarly, there was no significant difference between misinformation (N = 43) and accurate (N = 47) information groups in the level of worry about terrorism after consulting official data. However, the role of media engagement has proven essential: when presented with accurate information followed by reliable data, participants’ worry about terrorism decreased significantly, but only for those highly engaged with news concerning terrorism. Similarly, when presented with misinformation followed by reliable data, participants’ worry significantly increased, but only for those not engaged with terrorism-related news. Further analyses revealed a polarization effect within the group of participants exposed to inaccurate information and reliable data, with the engagement with terrorism-related news and conservatism as predictors.

We investigate susceptibility to this pro-Kremlin disinformation from a cognitive-science perspective. Is greater analytic thinking associated with less belief in disinformation, as per classical theories of reasoning? Or does analytic thinking amplify motivated system 2 reasoning (or “cultural cognition”), such that analytic thinking is associated with more polarized beliefs (and thus more belief in pro-Kremlin disinformation among pro-Russia Ukrainians)? In online (N = 1,974) and face-to-face representative (N = 9,474) samples of Ukrainians, we find support for the classical reasoning account. Analytic thinking, as measured using the Cognitive Reflection Test, was associated with greater ability to discern truth from disinformation—even for Ukrainians who are strongly oriented towards Russia. We find similar, albeit weaker, results when operationalizing analytic thinking using the self-report Actively Open-Minded Thinking scale. These results demonstrate a similar pattern to prior work using American participants. Thus, the positive association between analytic thinking and the ability to discern truth versus falsehood generalizes to the qualitatively different information environment of postcommunist Ukraine.

However, simultaneous evaluation of learner metacognition more accurately assesses the multiple dimensions of knowledge and has been shown to increase assessment validity and reliability. Motivation for researching these multidimensional methods has primarily been to identify guesswork and misinformation by evaluating the alignment of response correctness with the learner’s certainty that their provided response is correct. Learner confidence before assessment, however, has not been thoroughly investigated either alone or in conjunction with certainty for use in performance evaluation, especially at the undergraduate level. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy for assessing pre-assessment confidence and post-response certainty in relation to response correctness for students in an undergraduate linear algebra course. Due to the subjective nature of self-reflection, certainty was found to be more aligned with correctness than confidence. Though confidence and certainty levels were reported with similar overall averages, 32% of students demonstrated misaligned confidence and certainty. This study demonstrates the usefulness of a novel assessment method and presents insights that may inform teaching methods, improve examination structure, and identify concerning student behaviors early for corrective intervention. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152565872"

We report combined analyses across 10 studies testing these predictions. Seven studies (total N = 1,323) used a mediational framework and found that the more consistent misinformation was with participants’ attitudes, the more discomfort was elicited by a retraction of the misinformation. Greater discomfort then predicted greater continued belief in the misinformation, which, in turn, predicted greater use of the misinformation when participants made relevant inferences. Three additional studies (total N = 574) utilized misattribution paradigms to demonstrate that the relation between discomfort and belief in misinformation is causal in nature. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126014288"

Recent research suggests Christians are especially susceptible to belief in conspiracy theories in the United States, but scholars have yet to ascertain the role of religiopolitical identities and epistomological approaches, specifically Christian nationalism and biblical literalism, in generalized conspiracy thinking. Because Christian nationalists sense that the nation is under cultural threat and biblical literalism provides an alternative (often anti-elite) source of information, we predict that both will amplify conspiracy thinking. We find that Christian nationalism and biblical literalism independently predict conspiracy thinking, but that the effect of Christian nationalism increases with literalism.

This work revises recent literature on AI and ML techniques to combat disinformation, ranging from automatic classification to feature extraction, as well as their role in creating realistic synthetic content. We conclude that ML advances have been mainly focused on automatic classification and scarcely adopted outside research labs due to their dependence on limited-scope datasets.

Coordinated information operations frequently spread mis/disinformation through inauthentic or ""troll""accounts that appear to be trustworthy members to the targeted polity, as in Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. We experimentally tested the efficacy of inoculation against inauthentic online actors, using the Spot the Troll Quiz, a free, online educational tool that teaches how to spot markers of inauthenticity. Inoculation works in this setting. Across an online US nationally representative sample (N = 2,847), which also oversampled older adults, we find that taking the Spot the Troll Quiz (vs. playing a simple game) significantly increases participants' accuracy in identifying trolls among a set of Twitter accounts that are novel to participants. This inoculation also reduces participants' self-efficacy in identifying inauthentic accounts and reduced the perceived reliability of fake news headlines, although it had no effect on affective polarization. And while accuracy in the novel troll-spotting task is negatively associated with age and Republican party identification, the Quiz is equally effective on older adults and Republicans as it was on younger adults and Democrats. In the field, a convenience set of Twitter users who posted their Spot the Troll Quiz results in the fall of 2020 (N = 505) reduced their rate of retweeting in the period after the Quiz, with no impact on original tweeting. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165668153"

This study assesses the influence of vaccine information and other factors on vaccine acceptance in the Thai population. Between March and August 2021, six rounds of cross-sectional surveys through village health volunteer networks and online channels were conducted; as well as qualitative interviews with frontline health workers, patients with chronic diseases, and religious believers and leaders. Descriptive and multiple logistic regression with 95% level of confidence were used for survey findings while deductive thematic analysis was used for in-depth interview findings. Among the total 193,744 respondents, the initial COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate decreased from 60.3% in March 2021 to 44.0% in April 2021, then increased to 88.8% in August 2021. Participants who were able to differentiate true and false statements were 1.2 to 2.4 times more likely to accept vaccine than those who were not. Those who perceived a high risk of infection (Adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 2.6–4.7), perceived vaccine safety (AOR = 1.4–2.4), judged the importance of vaccination (AOR = 2.3–5.1), and had trust in vaccine manufacture (AOR = 1.9–3.2) were also more likely to accept the vaccine. Moreover, higher education (AOR = 1.6–4.1) and living in outbreak areas (AOR = 1.4–3.0) were significantly related to vaccine uptake, except in people with chronic diseases who tended not to accept the vaccine (AOR = 0.7–0.9). This study recommends effective infodemic management and comprehensive public communication, prioritising vulnerable groups such as those with a low level of education and people with chronic conditions. Communication through reliable channels can support higher vaccine acceptance and rapid vaccine rollout. Finally, regular monitoring of misinformation is important such as fact checking support, timely legal actions and specific debunking communication. © 2023 Kosiyaporn et al.

In this paper, we first present an overview of the ethical risks associated with real-world misinformation. We then report results from a scoping review of ethical practices in misinformation research. We investigated (1) the extent to which researchers report the details of their ethical practices, including issues of informed consent and debriefing, and (2) the specific steps that researchers report taking to protect participants from the consequences of misinformation exposure. We found that fewer than 30% of misinformation papers report any debriefing, and almost no authors assessed the effectiveness of their debriefing procedure. Building on the findings from this review, we evaluate the balance of risk versus reward currently operating in this field and propose a set of guidelines for best practices. Our ultimate goal is to allow researchers the freedom to investigate questions of considerable scientific and societal impact while meeting their ethical obligations to participants. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144536740"

This is known as the continued influence effect, and one of its presumed drivers is misinformation familiarity. As continued influence can promote misguided or unsafe behaviours, it is important to find ways to minimize the effect by designing more effective corrections. It has been argued that correction effectiveness is reduced if the correction repeats the to-be-debunked misinformation, thereby boosting its familiarity. Some have even suggested that this familiarity boost may cause a correction to inadvertently increase subsequent misinformation reliance; a phenomenon termed the familiarity backfire effect. A study by Pluviano et al. (2017) found evidence for this phenomenon using vaccine-related stimuli. The authors found that repeating vaccine “myths” and contrasting them with corresponding facts backfired relative to a control condition, ironically increasing false vaccine beliefs. The present study sought to replicate and extend this study. We included four conditions from the original Pluviano et al. study: the myths vs. facts, a visual infographic, a fear appeal, and a control condition. The present study also added a “myths-only” condition, which simply repeated false claims and labelled them as false; theoretically, this condition should be most likely to produce familiarity backfire. Participants received vaccine-myth corrections and were tested immediately post-correction, and again after a seven-day delay. We found that the myths vs. facts condition reduced vaccine misconceptions. None of the conditions increased vaccine misconceptions relative to control at either timepoint, or relative to a pre-intervention baseline; thus, no backfire effects were observed. This failure to replicate adds to the mounting evidence against familiarity backfire effects and has implications for vaccination communications and the design of debunking interventions. © 2023 Ecker et al.

Despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence, research on whether and how politicians’ verbal attacks against the “lying press” and “fake news” lead to non-state violence against journalists is limited. This study makes the case that features of the political landscape where anti-media proponents emerge explain why discourse increases journalists’ vulnerability to attacks. Because anti-media discourse is common in contexts where mechanisms of accountability for non-state violence against the press are already weak and electoral competition is fierce, what politicians say can be particularly consequential. Discourse legitimizes non-state attacks, signals to transgressors that violence will not be prosecuted, and paves the way for electorally motivated violence. I capitalize on case narratives collected by local human rights monitoring organizations and media transcripts to build an original dataset of anti-media messages and non-state attacks against journalists in Venezuela (2002–2013). Using survival and instrumental variable models, I show that politicians’ messages are positively correlated with non-state physical attacks against journalists, that the estimated effect of discourse on violence is largest in highly competitive electoral districts, and that electoral campaigns amplify the degree to which messages increase the incidence of attacks by party loyalists. I also show that the longer politicians sustain anti-media discourse, the more likely it is to increase journalists’ vulnerability to attacks. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118875847"

We predicted that source expertise can impact a retraction’s believability independent of trustworthiness, but that this is most likely when the source does not have a vested interest in issuing a retraction. Study 1 demonstrated that retractions from an expert source are believed more and lead to less continued belief in misinformation than retractions from an inexpert source while controlling for perceptions of trustworthiness. Additionally, Study 1 demonstrated that this only occurs when the source had no vested interest in issuing the retraction. Study 2 found similar effects using a design containing manipulations of both expertise and trustworthiness.

At the beginning of the pandemic, science did not yet have a medicinal product for this new disease, and alternative medicines offering “miracle cures” were acclaimed by some citizens looking for an effective treatment for COVID-19. This article aims to study a specific “miracle cure”, namely, chlorine dioxide, a bleaching agent for textiles or paper that also has disinfectant properties (water, surfaces). The dissemination of information about chlorine dioxide to French-speaking people on the social network Twitter from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021 is analyzed using a graph network. The results show that messages promoting misinformation, even if they are likely to be quantitatively less numerous, spread more widely than those based on more reliable information. In addition, this article shows that chlorine dioxide was promoted as an effective cure by medical doctors and peer-reviewed articles, which consequently increased the dissemination of this belief in the social space. Consequently, the process of misinformation entered the sphere of scientific controversy. The boundary between science and misinformation is becoming blurred to the point that it is no longer possible until proven otherwise to call chlorine dioxide a “false miracle cure” but a controversial treatment against COVID-19. © 2023 by the author.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163704931"

Proposed solutions vary substantially. Here, I describe a set of prospective benchmarks—10 competencies—that seem essential for reorienting science education to address the challenge. They include, first, elements of epistemic motivation, including basic epistemological beliefs about “constructed” knowledge, adopting a posture of respect for empirical evidence, and an understanding of our epistemic dependence on experts. Second, the benchmarks include perspectives and skills in interacting with media sources. These include how to identify experts, how to identify credible gatekeepers, how to recognize deceptive strategies, and how to deal with social networks and technology. Finally, the competencies include self-regulation, such as acknowledging the cognitive dispositions that bias our thinking (especially about information that challenges our pre-existing beliefs) and the counter-balancing role of consensus. I hope that these competency goals can function as a concrete target in guiding discussion of perhaps more complete or more nuanced approaches to the current crisis. With such competencies clearly and explicitly articulated, teachers will be better positioned to develop effective classroom strategies to nurture the relevant competencies. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133546763"

The present study investigated how such attitudes and stereotypes influence media perception in terms of identifying manipulated news articles. In a fake news paradigm, N = 326 participants provided self-report measures of xenophobia and conservatism, and were presented with real news media articles describing crimes that were committed either by putative German (i.e., in-group) or putative immigrant (i.e., out-group) perpetrators. Half of the articles were manipulated, and the participants were asked to rate the articles with respect to the perceived veracity of the article and the reprehensibility of the described criminal offences. Xenophobia, but not conservatism, was associated with poorer news discernment and higher perceived veracity in the immigrant offender condition, but not in the native German offender condition. Reprehensibility was not differentially associated with xenophobia in the two origin-of-offender conditions. The fake news paradigm revealed an out-group bias with respect to the perceived veracity of media news, and this result offers an alternative to measure stereotypes about immigrants more subtly than by explicit self-report. Xenophobia seems to make people less sensitive to hints that could inform them about the falsehood of information. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150939139"

There is a debate in the literature about why people spread misinformation and what should be done about it. According to the purely cognitive account, people largely spread misinformation because they are lazy, not biased. According to a motivational account, people are also motivated to believe and spread misinformation for ideological and partisan reasons. To better understand the psychological and neurocognitive processes that underlie misinformation sharing among the far-right, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment with conservatives and far-right partisans in the Unites States and Spain (N= 1,609) and a neuroimaging study with far-right partisans in Spain (N = 36). Far-right partisans in Spain and U.S. Republicans who highly identify with Trump were more likely to share misinformation than center-right voters and other Republicans, especially when the misinformation was related to sacred values (e.g., immigration). Sacred values predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond familiarity, attitude strength, and salience of the issue. Moreover, far-right partisans were unresponsive to fact-checking and accuracy nudges. At a neural level, this group showed increased activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing and norm compliance in response to posts with sacred values. These results suggest that the two components of political devotion—identity fusion and sacred values—play a key role in misinformation sharing, highlighting the identity-affirming dimension of misinformation sharing. We discuss the need for motivational and identity-based interventions to help curb misinformation for high-risk partisan groups. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170231515"

More research is needed on technology incidental learning effects, defined as changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors as a result of being exposed to information while pursuing goals other than learning (e.g., entertainment). In this study, we examined how 51 college students responded to incidental exposure to accurate and inaccurate COVID-19 information delivered via a simulated social media environment. Participants’ verbalizations during think-aloud protocols indicated numerous mental processes including cognition, metacognition, epistemic cognition, motivation, and emotions. Positively valanced mental processing was more often expressed with accurate COVID-19 information and negatively valanced mental processing was more often verbalized with misinformation. Negatively valanced evaluations of knowledge claims and sources predicted less engagement with COVID-19 misinformation posts. However, in many cases the relations among verbalized mental processing and behavioral responses were complex or nonob-vious. For example, participants’ positive metacognition and epistemic cognition verbalizations decreased their likelihood of engaging with accurate COVID-19 information, whereas positive interest was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging with misinformation.

Participants experienced the creation of deepfakes and assessed their ability to counter disinformation. They delved into their own construct systems and reflected on the genesis of their vulnerabilities. They moved from being unfamiliar with the deepfake phenomenon to becoming empowered digital citizens, motivated to develop their skills in assessing the validity of online information and resisting manipulation regardless of its source. The study provides recommendations for more targeted education about deepfakes and disinformation for youth. Educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers can use these findings to ensure that a well-equipped generation of digital citizens protects society from the growing disinformation plague. With this proof of concept, the next step is to bring this approach to a larger number of youth and contribute to the fight against malicious deepfakes, while developing strategies to integrate PCT-informed learning experiences into education. © 2023 The Author(s).

The study was conducted during—and is thematically framed by—the Covid‐19 pandemic, and it investigates how news, information, and deliberation related to this crisis were facilitated in the communities. The article embarks from ideas of informed citizenship and problems of misinformation and free speech related to the pandemic, and it aims to uncover developments in local democracy in places left behind by local journalism and dominated by platforms. The article argues that “news desert” is not an accurate term describing such places. Instead, such places and their social media platform dependency constitute what is identified as “casual democracies.” In casual local democracies, who and what gets to dominate the local public spheres is difficult to predict, as are the credibility and trustworthiness of local news and information and the interests that local news and information providers serve. Such local democracies are, to a large degree, shaped by informal power structures, individual agency, and the infrastructure of platforms. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167912560"

This study sets out to understand the news industry’s credibility crisis by comparing public perceptions of journalism with public perceptions of another institution facing similar trust challenges: healthcare. Drawing on in‐depth interviews with 31 US adults, we find that although both healthcare and journalism face public distrust, members of the public generally tend to feel more trusting of individual doctors than they do of individual journalists. This is because people (a) perceive doctors to be experts in their field and (b) engage more frequently with doctors than they do with journalists. Consequently, our interviewees described treating their doctors as “fact‐checkers” when it comes to health information they find online, demonstrating trust in their physicians despite their lack of trust in healthcare more broadly. Meanwhile, the opposite unfolds in journalism: Instead of using legitimate news sources to fact‐check potential misinformation, people feel compelled to “fact‐check” legitimate news by seeking alternative sources of corroboration. We conclude that, to improve their credibility among the public, journalists must strike the right balance between persuading the public to perceive them as experts while also pursuing opportunities to engage with the public as peers. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178910758"

Immigration, both documented and undocumented, is a controversial political and social issue. It is a lightning rod for debate. Emotions are heightened during conversations about this topic; there is no neutral position on the subject.

The most important extension was that the replications included a larger number of true Tweets than the original study and planned analyses of responses to true Tweets. The four replications were loosely coordinated, with each team independently working out how to implement the agreed plan.

Despite the existence of many fake news detection models; annotation inconsistency, memory consumption, accurate and self-trained efficient algorithms for detecting the emerging COVID-19 misinformation tweets are still challenging. Hence, the main aim of this work is to come up with a self-trained semi-supervised model that accurately and automatically detects the reliability of emerging COVID-19 tweets without delay. In this work, COVID-19 tweet dataset is created in English Language from the period January 2020 to January 2022 as a ground truth database. Then self-trained semi-supervised hybrid deep learning model is proposed to train both supervised and unsupervised components simultaneously using the created dataset. The proposed model is self-trained repeatedly and the model gets updated to predict the reliability of upcoming COVID-19 tweets that differ from training tweets. We performed experiments multiple times by limiting the percentage amount of labelled tweets shown to the model, namely 80%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% labelled tweets, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 80.92% accuracy and 98.15% accuracy in the 10% and 80% label-seen experiments, respectively. This shows a clear rising trend in the performance curve. Therefore, this technique will be useful for effectively classifying voluminous amounts of emerging tweets generated as part of the COVID-19 infodemic. The proposed model may efficiently use a huge amount of unlabelled tweets and enhance the model's generalization performance. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176758063"

Historical revisionism plays an essential role in Russian foreign policy towards the post-Soviet space and is in strong relation with the concepts of Near Abroad and Russkii Mir (‘Russian World’) and with certain ideas contained in the neo-Eurasianist Movement. This article examines Russian revisionist narratives disseminated in information and influencing campaigns in Europe and against the West.       Methods: This study uses a mixed methodology combining desk research, including literature review, and analysis of the EUvsDisinfo database of cases identified before the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. R esults: The manipulation of historical events has been largely employed by the Kremlin as a tool for foreign interference to achieve strategic objectives. First World War treaties, mainly the Trianon Peace Treaty, as well as the Second World War and the communist and fascist historical experiences in countries within the post-Soviet space, are the pivotal topics from which hostile influencing narratives are built. From the analysis of the EUvsDisinfo database, the article identifies seven topic themes.       Conclusions:  Our findings suggest that pre-emptively elaborated counter-narratives based on historical evidence and sound historiography can be an effective tool against hostile revisionist narratives that exploit vulnerabilities and specific target groups within European societies.

However, the sub-dimensions of NFM have distinct implications: The reliance on peers and not seeking but feeling informed dimensions work in the same manner as when NFM is treated as a single-dimensional construct, whereas reliance on algorithmic news negatively predicts belief in misinformation and negatively mediates the aforementioned relationship.

Machine learning and natural language processing are often touted as the perfect solutions for the problem of detecting misinformation at scale. We argue, however, that current approaches tend to fall short because of the unavailability of reliably annotated data. Given the scarcity of quality labelled data, we first conduct a data collection effort by leveraging fact-checking websites. Second, we perform a comparative feature analysis of the news articles with true vs false content. Finally, we conduct a set of text classification experiments using a variety of methods and show that the quality of the training data in terms of its labelling system and balanced coverage of topics directly affects the classification accuracy on test data (news articles that the classifier did not see during training). Feature analysis experiments show specific trends of linguistic patterns in fake news articles. In predictive classification, some of these features such as n-grams and semantic features help considerably in recognising false from true news articles and some features such as readability features tend to be less helpful. We also compare deep learning classification models against feature-based models and show that, given the small size of currently available data, feature-based models are more capable of cross-topic generalisation. This result points to the need for automatic classification methods that are informed by linguistic, corpus linguistic, and stylistic research. Finally, we show that using data labelled based on the reputation of the sources does not result in accurate classification of test data, which, in turn, motivates future data collection with reliable tagging and on diverse topics. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

The experiment measures the improvement achieved by older adults in the detection of political disinformation thanks to a digital competence course offered through WhatsApp. The study comprises a total sample of 1,029 individu-als, subdivided into a control group (n = 531) and an experimental group (n = 498), from which a qualified experimental subsample (n = 87) was extracted. Results reveal that participants’ political beliefs, ranging from left to right positions, influence their ability to detect misinformation. A progressive political position is associated with higher accuracy in identifying right-biased news headlines and lower accuracy for left-biased headlines. A conservative position is associated with higher accuracy when the news headline has a progressive bias, but lower accuracy when the headline is right-wing. Users are more critical when the headline has a bias against theirs, while they are more likely to believe news that confirms their own beliefs. The study adds evidence on the relevance of cognitive biases in disinformation and supports the convenience of designing specific media literacy actions aimed at older adults. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175429739"

PIL is necessary to navigate the convoluted political information landscape, including the threats to democracy and the spreading of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news. Having PIL is especially crucial in adolescence and young adulthood as these are prime phases where young people shape their beliefs and attitudes and learn about their political and civic lives. Understanding what it means to have PIL is essential so that educators and practitioners can teach and assess PIL, resulting in young people being able to understand, analyze, critique, and make informed decisions on political information. This systematized review sampled 99 journal articles and conference papers from seven databases in the disciplines affiliated with the social sciences published between 2006 and 2022. The paper discusses how different factors shape and contribute to or hinder young people’s political knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy as they navigate political information.

Identifying how older adults assess the credibility of health information that they acquire on social media is an important step toward understanding and reducing their susceptibility to health misinformation. In this study, we investigated the credibility assessment strategies used by older WeChat users in China. Following a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with 40 WeChat users 65–85 years old (M = 71.75, SD = 6.65) in China who had acquired health information on WeChat. Results of theoretical thematic analysis revealed five source-based and content-based evaluative strategies: (1) determining the communicative orientation of the source, (2) assessing source reputation, (3) confirming content based on life experiences, (4) checking for exaggeration in claimed effects, and (5) assessing the consistency of content across sources. Older WeChat users’ reliance on certain heuristic cues and their self-reliant approach to assessing information credibility provide contextual explanations for the link between heuristic processing and susceptibility to health misinformation. The findings have implications for anti-misinformation interventions targeting the older population in China and potentially beyond. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this new environment, the amount of information available and the speed at which it is disseminated are multiplied. The characteristics of social networks offer many opportunities to those who want to spread disinformation. It is easy to create hoaxes and make them viral. Therefore, it is essential to help the public distinguish between a reliable source and one that is not. This is one of the main challenges facing journalism today. Fact-checking initiatives are an essential part of the journalistic task of generating reliable spaces for the public within the tide of online information to which they have constant access. Thus, journalism faces a double challenge. On the one hand, it has to become one of the main reliable sources for the public searching for information on the internet and social networks. On the other hand, it has to help citizens to detect toxic sources that try to contaminate public debate through disinformation.

Guided by the Risk Information Seeking and Processing model, this study explored the roles of medical mistrust and social media as a source of risk information in Black Americans’ vaccine hesitancy. Survey results from a YouGov panel sample of Black Americans (n = 1,136; 53.5% female) showed that social media use and medical mistrust were positively associated with belief in misinformation related to the COVID-19 vaccine, which, in turn, was positively related to vaccine hesitancy through perceived information insufficiency and information seeking intentions.

We build on theories of rational belief updating and motivated reasoning, and link public opinion data from 82 national elections with expert survey data on disinformation and de facto electoral integrity. We show that, overall, people arrive at largely accurate perceptions, but that disinformation campaigns are indeed associated with less accurate and more polarized beliefs about election fairness.

We describe a survey experiment conducted during the 2019 election in Argentina measuring the propensity of voters to share corrections to political misinformation that randomly confirm or challenge their initial beliefs. We find evidence of selective sharing—the notion that individuals prefer to share pro-attitudinal rather than counter-attitudinal fact-checks. This effect, however, is conditioned by the type of adjudication made by fact-checkers. More specifically, in line with motivated reasoning processes, respondents report a higher intent to share confirmations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “true” rating) compared with refutations (i.e. messages fact-checked with a “false” rating). Experimental results are partially confirmed with a regression discontinuity analysis of observational data of Twitter and replicated with additional experiments.

We investigated this phenomenon by asking what kind of results users see when they search for information on eleven popular conspiracy theories (CTs) via Google. We analysed links from Google search results (N = 1259) in 12 Western and non-Western countries and 10 languages. Overall, users are more likely to encounter neutral or debunking content when using Google to search for prominent CTs. However, for some CTs, strong country differences in the quality of search results emerge, showing clear correlations between categorical inequalities and unequal access to reliable information. In countries where journalists enjoy less freedom, people enjoy fewer democratic rights and are less able to rely on social elites, Google also provides less enlightening content on CTs than in developed and prosperous democracies. The countries thus disadvantaged are precisely those countries where there is a high propensity to believe in CTs according to comparative survey research. However, in countries where a global language is spoken, for example, English or Portuguese, there is no correlation between structural, country-specific factors and the quality of search results. In this sense, structurally disadvantaged countries seem to benefit from belonging to a larger language community. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177420309"

We conducted news literacy training with 101 Hong Kong students (aged 11 to 14) evaluating their news literacy, susceptibility to fake news, perceived responsibility, as well as motivation to engage in protective behaviours. The training significantly enhanced participants’ news media knowledge, perceived control, and reduced their vulnerability to fake news. Participants became more motivated to report fake news, warn others, suggest alternative sources, and manage preferences to filter our problematic news sources. Participants also demonstrated an improved ability to evaluate the credibility of a real-world news article. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the training for this age group and suggest its potential for implementation in junior secondary-school classrooms. © 2023 The Author(s).

Both men are obsessed with a grievance that deeply wounded them; enraged, they are determined to sell a false narrative of being afflicted by forces that should be demolished. Captain Ahab is physically and psychologically dismembered by an earlier confrontation with the white whale which severed his leg. Ahab’s vengeance pulls the entire crew into his false depiction that Moby Dick is either the principal or the agent of evil itself. Defeated presidential candidate for reelection, Donald Trump shares a similar mutilation. His response is to insist on a false narrative of a stolen election; his grievance demands he be reinstated for a second term. Both leaders’ false stories lead in their own trajectories to violence, the response of distorted views that conflate fictions with facts. Violence is embedded deeply in the American psyche. Wounded innocence is the heartbeat of both insurrections, one against nature and the other against the cultural myth of America embodied in the Constitution. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Ipek S.

By deepening their processing, they likely look for true cues to accept information instead of false cues to reject it. The current paper examined whether the OV theory works in the evaluation of information credibility in two studies. Study 1 found that more elaborated information processing brought higher perceived information credibility, no matter whether the news was true or false. Study 2 found that false cues made little impact on perceived information credibility, but true cues increased it significantly. As for people who had little prior knowledge, enriching either true or false details increased their perceived credibility.

Our results show that panelists who are exposed to misinformation consume more reliable news and from a more ideologically diverse range of sources.

Despite this urgency and the severity of the outcomes of mis- and disinformation, social media environments remain largely unregulated. The solution is not really, unilaterally within the grasp of education, nor does it rest solely in the province of legislation and policy. Instead, we need much thoughtful debate and advocacy to build a new technological world that can render many of the benefits of freedom, choice, and community, with at least some mitigation of the toxic manipulations of greed, desire for power, and corruption. Education in the Age of Misinformation seeks to explore the significance of the changing nature of youth life and the implications for education. The book pursues various philosophical and conceptual and pedagogical inquiries into the shifting responsibilities of education in a time of hastened change. The explorations in the following chapters notably do not seek to provide solutions in any pat or instrumentalist way. None of the authors propose more technology as the answer to the problems created by neoliberal capitalist technology. Instead, what you will find in the collection are a range of investigations into the nature of knowing, evidence, information, and identity-formation. Authors take up the relationships between what it means to form beliefs and opinions in relation to a cluttered and manipulated information landscape, and what these closely held beliefs mean for the public sphere, democratic engagement, and participatory discourse. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172122671"

Fake news contaminates democracy by blurring the sight and the vision, or by altering the beliefs of citizens on simple everyday matters but also on significant matters such as vaccination, politics, social issues, or public health. Lots of efforts have been conducted in order to tackle the phenomenon. Fact-checking platforms consist of a major step in this issue. Certain cases of fact-checking platforms worldwide seem to work properly and fulfill their strategic goals, although functional and other issues might emerge. This study comes to take the fact-checking platform evolution one step beyond by proposing a new communication model for fake news detection and busting. The proposed model's blueprint is based on the Greek ""Ellinika Hoaxes"" fact-checking platform with some critical reinforcements: More extensive use of crowdsourcing strategies for detecting and busting non-true stories with the aid of AI chatbots in order not only to bust non-true stories but also to rank news outlets, writers, social media personas and journalists for their credibility. This way, serious news outlets, journalists, and media professionals can build their trust and be ranked for the credibility of their services for a more trustful and democratic public sphere. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168588948"

Considering these findings, the present work sought to assess the extent to which general social media use might be conditionally related to political knowledge. To do so, we explored the moderating effect of information-related self-efficacy beliefs. Specifically, building upon general self-efficacy theory and the idea that there exists considerable concern over the extent to which information on social media is factually incorrect, misleading, or biased, we predicted that mis and disinformation self-efficacy (MDSE) beliefs would positively condition the relationship between general social media usage and political knowledge. Contrary to our expectations, the results of three studies indicated that the combination of MDSE and frequent social media use was negatively related to political knowledge.

To better understand how such accusations can affect the credibility of real information and policy preferences, we conducted a two-wave panel experiment (Nwave2 = 788) to assess the longer-term effect of delegitimizing labels targeting an authentic video message. We find that exposure to an accusation of misinformation or disinformation lowered the perceived credibility of the video but did not affect policy preferences related to the content of the video. Furthermore, more extreme disinformation accusations were perceived as less credible than milder misinformation labels. The effects lasted over a period of three days and still occurred when there was a delay in the label attribution. These findings indicate that while mis- and disinformation labels might make authentic content less credible, they are themselves not always deemed credible and are less likely to change substantive policy preferences. © 2023 (Michael Hameleers and Franziska Marquart).

Results: The study found that social media users may have difficulty telling the difference between information and disinformation. This can increasetheir fear, anxiety, and stress. This relationship appears to be clear, and cuts across all demographic lines. What is unclear is whether fear drives people to increase their social media searching for COVID-19 information, or if increased consumption increases fear?

To our knowledge, this is the first study to test empirically the predictive power of variance unique to each construct against covariance shared among these constructs when predicting authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Methods: Online survey was administered to 314 participants in 2021 that included a battery of demographic and psychological measures. Hierarchical factor models were used to isolate unique variance from shared covariance among responses to items representing conspiracy, paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs. Structural equation models were used to test their unique and shared effects on authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Results: We found that our combined measurement model of paranormal thinking, conspiracism, and pseudoscience exhibited exceptional model fit, and that each construct was strongly predictive of both SDO and RWA (r = 0.73–0.86). Once the shared covariance was partitioned into a higher order factor, the residual uniqueness in each first order factors was either negatively related or unrelated to authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. Moreover, the higher order factor explained the gross majority of variance in conspiracy (R2 = 0.81) paranormal (R2 = 0.81) and pseudoscientific (R2 = 0.95) beliefs and was a far stronger predictor (β = 0.85, p < 0.01) of anti-democratic attitudes than political partisanship (β = 0.17, p < 0.01). Strong partisan identifiers of both parties showed much higher romanticism scores than party moderates. Conclusion and limitations: When predicting authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes, we found no empirically unique contributions of conspiracy beliefs. Instead, we found that a shared factor, representing a ‘romantic’ mindset was the main predictor of authoritarian and anti-democratic attitudes. This finding potentially explains failures of interventions in stopping the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theory researchers should refocus on the shared features that conspiracy thinking has with other unwarranted epistemic beliefs to better understand how to halt the spread of misinformation, conspiracy thinking, anti-science attitudes, and even global authoritarianism.

The society recognises that false reports pose a real threat to the credibility of information and, ultimately, to the security of society. On the Internet an active audience is a distributor of media content because they are convinced of its truth, and in the online environment they find it in other people. Therefore, the audience seems to be an active amplifier of disinformation (sharing), and thus explicitly as a creator of (unwanted) web content (sharing and commenting). People’s willingness to share disinformation is linked to people’s similar attitudes; it is related to the similarity of faith and to the perception of the message, considered as appropriate and interesting (“I like it”), etc. The term “homogeneity” turns out to be a key term in audience research, and experts speak about a phenomenon that in fact appears to be the main driving force for the dissemination of any content.

We explored media communication not simply as the unidirectional transmission of collective beliefs to the Brazilian public, but as social representations co-constructed by citizens and expressed in the comments that they posted on social media. We collected data online and constructed two textual corpora. The first corpus included 134 news articles selected with the search terms ‘immigrants’ or ‘refugees’ and ‘Covid-19’. The second corpus included 1295 comments written by the readers of the mentioned articles and posted on the newspapers’ Facebook pages, which we considered a special interactive space for expressing, sharing, and co-constructing social representations. We analyzed the data using the Descending Hierarchical Analysis and Similarity Analysis provided by the software IRaMuTeQ. The results show social dynamics of argumentative polarization about (im)migrants framed in the geo-political Brazilian context at the time of the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our case study exemplifies how a context of crisis can reinforce the polarization of existing social representations of (im)migrants in Brazil. We discuss this polarization as an ‘echo chamber’ of informational polarization and fake news contributing to misinformation about Covid-19 worldwide, showing how political decisions may increase xenophobia or facilitate social dialogue. © 2023 Giacomozzi, Andréia Isabel, de Rosa, Annamaria Silvana, da Silva, Mariana Luiza Becker, Gizzi, Flavia & Moraes, Vitor de Sena.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167908804"

Here, we provide empirical tests of the importance of metacognition during the pandemic. Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrate that citizens with higher metacognitive sensitivity—where confidence differentiates correct from incorrect COVID-19 beliefs—reported higher willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19, and higher compliance with recommended public health measures. Notably, this benefit of accurate introspection held controlling for the accuracy of COVID-19 beliefs. By demonstrating how vaccination willingness and compliance may relate to insight into the varying accuracy of beliefs, rather than only the accuracy of the beliefs themselves, this research highlights the critical role of metacognitive ability in times of crisis. However, we do not find sufficient evidence to conclude that citizens with higher metacognitive sensitivity were more likely to comply with recommended public health measures when controlling for the absolute level of the confidence citizens had in their COVID-19 beliefs.

This study aims to ascertain the inclination and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy by conducting content analysis and sentiment analysis of the perspectives expressed in comments on videos related to vaccine hesitancy uploaded from India on YouTube. Design/methodology/approach: The assessment of the sentiments of the vaccine-hesitant population is done using Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner sentiment analysis module implemented with Python’s NLTK library to automatically determine the sentiments of the comments. Manual content analysis was performed on 60.09% viewer comments randomly selected from the total comments in 238 videos on vaccine hesitancy originated from India and labelled each comment with labels “Anti”, “Pro”, “Confused”, “Not Applicable” and “Unrelated” labels. Findings: The study found “Mistrust-Government policies”, “Fear-health related consequences”, “Mistrust-Scientific research”, “Vaccine effectiveness and efficacy” and “Misinformation/myths” as the top five determinants for vaccine hesitancy, whereas “Religious beliefs”, “Fear-Economic consequences”, “Side Effects- short-term” and “Fear-mode of administration” found to be the lesser cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. However, the study also investigates changes in the inclination of Indian commenters towards vaccine hesitancy and revolving issues over time. Social implications: Public health policymakers and health communicators may find the study useful in determining vaccine hesitancy factors in India. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in its approach. To date, no sentiment analysis has been conducted on the content released on YouTube by Indian content creators regarding pro- and anti-vaccination videos.

Much less attention has been paid to how citizens themselves make sense of misinformation as a broader social problem. We integrate theories of narrative, identity, cultural capital, and social distinction to examine how people construct the problem of misinformation and their orientation to it. We show how people engage in everyday ontological narratives of social distinction. These involve making a variety of discursive moves to position one’s “taste” in information consumption as superior to others constructed as lower in a social hierarchy. This serves to enhance social status by separating oneself from misinformation, which is presented as “other people’s problem.” We argue that these narratives have significant implications not only for citizens’ vigilance toward misinformation but also their receptiveness to interventions by policymakers, fact-checkers, news organizations, and media educators. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177067916"

The propagation of disinformation including misleading political advertising serves as a key example of how the Commission’s perception of the EU’s vulnerability to hybrid threats in times of geopolitical instability is shaping its regulatory policies. This article uses the framework of regulatory mercantilism, which argues that in conditions of perceived vulnerability, a state-like actor will reassert regulatory control based on a security logic in areas previously characterized by self-regulatory regimes. This article considers the Commission’s 2019–2024 priorities, and how the spheres of technology, security, and democracy policies are intersecting as a response to hybrid threats. As a result, online platform governance in the EU is being substantially restructured with a move from systems of self-regulation to co-regulation backed by sanction as a means of combating hybrid threats online. The Commission’s “taking back control” from platforms in the context of a digital sovereignty agenda serves as an example of regulatory mercantilism in digital policy, which sees the Commission seek to promote regulatory strength in response to perceived vulnerability. © 2023 The Author(s).

We investigate (1) whether technique-based inoculation can reduce susceptibility to content designed to fuel intergroup polarization; (2) whether technique-based inoculation can offer cross-protection against misinformation techniques that people were not inoculated against; and (3) whether political ideology plays a role in how people engage with anti-misinformation interventions.

This leads to an abundance of low-quality information that might later need to be corrected and provides a foundation on which false beliefs can arise. Today, the general population often consults digital media platforms for news content. Because of the sheer amount of news articles and the various ways digital media platforms organize material, readers may encounter news articles with faulty content and their subsequent corrections in various orders. They might read the misinformation before the corrected version or vice versa. We conducted two studies in which participants were presented with two reports of a news event: one report that included a piece of misinformation and one report in which that misinformation was retracted. The order in which the two reports were encountered was manipulated. In Study 1, the retraction contained an explicit reminder of the misinformation; in Study 2, it did not. Neither Study 1 nor Study 2 found an effect of presentation order on misinformation reliance. These findings run counter to predictions by those accounts of the continued influence effect that suggest a better encoding of retractions and subsequent lesser reliance on misinformation when retractions are encountered first. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168843604"

Vaccination is one readily available public health tool, yet vaccine uptake is lower among minority populations and hesitations and concerns are high. In the present study, interpersonal and media sources of information about COVID-19 were discussed in a series of six focus groups with Spanish-language dominant and bilingual English-Spanish respondents in a large metropolitan area in Texas. Participants reported using legacy media as a main source of information about COVID-19 vaccines and encountered conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media. Using the Health Belief Model as the theoretical lens, we found individuals’ and family members’ perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 played a part in participants wanting to find and get the vaccine. Provider recommendations may have served as cues to action. Ease of receiving the vaccines at church and pharmacies may have served to boost participants self-efficacy. Perceived barriers include vaccine specific reasons such as the fast pace of initial authorization, side effects, and long-term effects along with conspiracy theories. Prevailing information gaps regarding the COVID-19 vaccines and the resulting uncertainty are discussed.

As such, nowadays, many social media influencers–who have risen to fame due to successful self-branding–act as educators and role models for environmental matters. To illuminate the appeal of green influencers and the relationship they develop with their followers, we conducted in-depth interviews employing a novel digital go-along approach. Findings suggest that relationships with green influencers are fueled by the entanglement of relational and substantive environmental content. This mix underlies followers’ perceptions of sharing a reality and perceiving the influencer as a super peer. As for the characteristics of the follower-influencer bond, we show that followers appreciate the potential for reciprocity, while the relationship itself remains mainly asymmetric. We furthermore elucidate three key components that explain the unique appeal of influencers’ environmental communication: nuanced environmentalism, perceived reproducibility and trust in autodidactic expertise. KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS Influencers’ ability to provide reproducible environmental recommendations make them valuable collaboration partners for pro-environmental organizations and political actors. Youth especially appreciate that influencers offer non-judgmental, nuanced pro-environmental advice, which informs other pro-environmental actors trying to reach young people. Ascribing credibility to influencers based on their autodidactic skills rather than due to their formal training puts young people at risk of misinformation, which should be accounted for in influencer support programs, media literacy trainings, and public awareness campaigns. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166972429"

An experiment with 859 participants revealed few differences in effectiveness across fact-checking sources but found that sources perceived as more credible are more effective. Indeed, the data show that perceived credibility of fact-check sources mediates the relationship between exposure to fact-checking messages and their effectiveness for some source types. Moreover, fact-checker credibility moderates the effect of alignment on effectiveness, while analytic thinking is unrelated to fact-checker credibility perceptions, alignment, and effectiveness.

Accordingly, I defend an alternative diagnosis of the relevant epistemic error.

Mimetic and rhetorical theory offer resources for critiquing the personal vigilance approach, as well as demonstrating how social media facilitates communicative processes of imitation and adaptation. In this view, the rhetorical process of identification can transmogrify disinformation’s deceptive intent and deleterious consequences.

Examples from various African countries such as Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania are examined to highlight the actual situation. Communication and health communication theories discussed are: Theory of Reasoned Action, Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Protection Motivation Theory. The role the media (Newspapers, magazines, radio, television and social media networks) have played in persuading people to accept to be vaccinated and to wear masks is discussed. Studies conducted in Africa reveal that different countries have had to deal with different reactions towards COVID-19 communication. Studies reviewed from other continents show that what is applicable there can also work in Africa. African, Chinese and Iranian examples are discussed to prove that the above-named theories can also be applied in Africa to persuade people to maintain COVID-19 protocols and to accept to be vaccinated. Social media users communicated COVID-19 messages but most of them have participated more in spreading misinformation and propaganda about COVID-19 just as it happened during the Ebola pandemic in West Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173890526"

In this research note, the perceived credibility and persuasiveness of unverified negative information about brands posted on social media and the role therein of congruencies among the partisan identity of the self, the source of information, and the brand (i.e., liberal versus conservative) are investigated. Following marketing research on “identity congruency” and “motivated reasoning” effects, three experiments demonstrate that self-source, self-brand, and source-brand partisan identity (in)congruencies can influence the credibility and persuasiveness of unverified negative brand information. However, the observed partisan identity (in)congruency effects were found to be asymmetric; that is, their nature or magnitude was dependent on whether liberal or conservative partisan identities were involved. This research note also emphasizes that unverified negative brand information posted on social media can have a substantial impact on brand evaluations, even if consumers doubt its veracity. These findings are relevant not only for advertisers (on social media) and brand managers but also for researchers who study online disinformation. It is hoped that this research note will lead to further research on the nature and drivers of asymmetric partisan identity (in)congruency effects in advertising and other communications contexts. © Copyright © 2023, American Academy of Advertising.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176090814"

We take a complementary approach by investigating the conditions under which interpersonal concerns drive selective exposure. Drawing on a large literature on impression management, we test a social signaling model of selective exposure, which predicts that (a) individuals shift their information selection decisions to signal to observers and (b) observers reward such shifts. We test this model in the domain of partisan politics in the United States across five financially incentivized, preregistered experiments (N = 3,598). Our results extend prior theory by identifying three key contingencies: the type of task on which observers expect to collaborate with actors, alignment of group membership between observers and actors, and the magnitude of demonstrated selective exposure. Overall, we find that tailoring one’s information selection decisions can indeed have strategic value—but only under certain theoretically predictable conditions. Our work also identifies an actor–observer misalignment: While observers are sensitive to the type of future interaction with an actor, the actors themselves do not intuit this sensitivity. In the era of social media, when information selection decisions are more public than ever and the spread of misinformation is pervasive, understanding the ways in which reputational considerations shape decision making not only illuminates why selective exposure persists, but also suggests novel mitigation strategies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178662414"

As fake news itself is typically partisan and tends to deceive publics for specific purposes (e.g. gaining support for specific agendas), it usually induces heated discussion and uncivil commenting, especially among politically partisan individuals. Thus, in this study, we explored the effects of uncivil comments following fake news and political orientation on belief in fake news and anger. We used two issues to explore these mechanisms: climate change and immigration. Our results show that uncivil comments following fake news weakened participants’ belief in fake news about climate change. Moreover, uncivil comments made people angrier after viewing fake news about each issue. A significant moderating effect of political orientation on this relationship also emerged. Conservatives, who generally had a lower level of anger toward fake news than liberals, were more likely to feel anger when they viewed uncivil comments rather than civil comments.

As a result, evaluating news has emerged as a crucial skill. However, it is yet unclear what variables contribute to this increase. To offer more insights, this study attempts to investigate through political news accessibility the factors influencing political news assessment of university students in Northeast Thailand. This study was a quantitative research, and the theory underlying it was news literacy. 1200 samples from undergraduate students from state, private, and autonomous universities were obtained through a multi-stage sampling. 400 questionnaires, utilized as a research tool, were distributed to each type of university for data collection. In order to examine the reliability of the research instrument, Cronbach's alpha was also used in a pre-test stage along with a content validity analysis of the questionnaire. For all elements, the alpha coefficient was 0.93. The findings demonstrated that political news assessment was most influenced by political news accessibility, which is the intervening variable (Beta = 0.265); followed by political news exposure from social media (Beta = 0.217); inner drives for the follow-up of political news (Beta = 0.190); influence of groups and social networks (Beta = 0.170); specific characteristics of the Internet (Beta = 0.151); importance of political news (Beta = 0.147); political news exposure from websites (Beta = 0.099); benefits of political news (Beta = 0.075); and political news exposure from print media (Beta = 0.042). The student characteristic factor, motivation for political news exposure factor, and political news exposure factor accounted for 67.45 percent of the variance in explaining political news evaluation among Thai students, through political news accessibility (R2 = 0.6745). Consequently, improving these elements will lead to better political news evaluation. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174184208"

A very simple model of direct impacts shows that information value, voluntary sharing, and false data risk significantly impact data sharing, but the other antecedents do not. The dependent variable was explicitly about sharing factual data, and these results suggest some feeling of social obligation to voluntarily share, particularly when respondents are well aware of the prevalence of misinformation.

This annotation proposal aims to detect disinformation patterns in text and to classify the global reliability of news. To this end, a dataset in Spanish was built and manually annotated with RUN-AS and several experiments using this dataset were conducted to validate the annotation scheme by using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.

Previous work has shown that both trait-related and situational factors influence the spread of fake news on social media. However, we have limited insight into how the specific contextual conditions that shape information processing on social media contribute to the proliferation of misinformation. In this article, we posit that people are more susceptible to spreading misinformation because they engage selectively, briefly, and heuristically with political news on social media. To test our argument, we rely on a pre-registered online experiment conducted in two Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, Hungary and Romania. We designed this experiment to reflect the fast and impulsive decision-making that is characteristic of online behavior on social media platforms. The results support the idea that individuals’ tendency to disseminate fake news is amplified by conditions of fast-paced and impulsive decision-making. The effect is particularly pronounced among respondents with higher right-wing authoritarian attitudes. This suggests that the fast and intuition-reliant nature of decision-making on social media encourages the spread of such misinformation that is in line with individuals’ ideological beliefs, which could increase social polarization in societies. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180247341"

That depends on what is meant by ""pathological."" This paper begins by unpacking that ill-defined and value-laden term before making the case that widespread conspiracy theory belief should not be conceptualized through the “othering’ perspective of individual psychopathology. In doing so, it adopts a phenomenological perspective to argue that conspiracy theory beliefs can be reliably distinguished from paranoid delusions based on falsity, belief conviction, idiosyncrasy, and self-referentiality. A socio-epistemic model is then presented that characterizes the broader phenomenon of conspiracy theory belief as a product of a sick society plagued by epistemic mistrust and vulnerability to misinformation that is ubiquitous in today’s post-truth world. Finally, it is proposed that for individuals, the harmfulness of conspiracy theory belief is less related to belief content as it is to belief conviction and degree of self-relevant consequentiality. Staging conspiracy theory belief in terms of ideological commitment offers a conceptual framework to estimate behavioral risks and test hypotheses about the effectiveness of interventions along a continuum of belief conviction and associated socio-epistemic dynamics. Interventions should target not only individuals, but the dysfunctional social conditions that give rise to the pervasive and enduring phenomenon of conspiracy theory belief. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179927876"

Unlike literary or cinematic works of fiction, which engage in a suspension of disbelief, ARGs facilitate a production of belief. They can teach us about fictionality in the twenty-first century and contemporary “post-truth” politics and “fake news” that result from algorithmic bias. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alison James, Akihiro Kubo and Françoise Lavocat.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179188813"

Specifically, it aims to investigate fact-checkers’ outputs regarding verification genres, scrutinized actors, types of verified falsehoods, and inspected platforms. The focus on Brazil stems from its reputation as a disinformation hub, owing to social polarization, populist communication, high social media use, low media trust, and intense WhatsApp penetration. Consequently, fact-checking agencies have proliferated within Brazil’s media landscape. To provide some hints about the fact-checkers’ editorial choices, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of verification articles (n = 349) published during the second round of the presidential election by four leading fact-checking organizations: Lupa and Aos Fatos (independents), Estadão Verifica (press), and AFP Checamos (global news agency). The results reveal a prioritization of combating online falsehoods (82.2%) spread by anonymous sources, as opposed to verifying public figures’ statements (5.5%), a trend already observed in other media systems. Although Meta’s social networks and Twitter are primarily monitored, other platforms such as TikTok, Kwai, and Telegram are increasingly gaining fact-checkers’ attention. Fact-checkers predominantly scrutinized anonymous disinformation agents. Moreover, they primarily debunked falsehoods targeting the opposition, legacy media, social networking companies, and the Supreme Electoral Court. Despite the anonymity, 77.4% of the verified falsehoods were found to be beneficial to Bolsonaro, while 12% were advantageous to Lula da Silva. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169702217"

Through a qualitative longitudinal analysis of data from the online posts of a prominent branch of the anti-lockdown freedom movement, we identify the movement’s core narratives, motivations, and forms of action, revealing how this social movement developed into a complex form of anti-government extremist movement that combines and conflates anti-institutional, anti-elite sentiments, and anti-government attitudes and beliefs through conspiratorial narratives. Drawing upon interrelated strands of social movement theory and the broader body of research on conspiracy theories and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on radicalisation to extremism, we offer a conceptual framework to understand the movement’s emergence, consolidation, and development.

To explore ways to minimize such politically biased processing of fact-checking messages, an online experiment (N = 645) examined how different source labels of fact-checking messages (human experts vs. AI vs. crowdsourcing vs. human experts-AI hybrid) influence partisans’ processing of fact-checking messages.

Eight pairs of adult participants were recruited from diverse cultural backgrounds to participate online in joint fact-checking of suspect Tweets. To examine their collaborative deliberations we developed a novel experimental design and analytical model. Our analyses indicate that the salience of online information to people’s cultural identities influences their decision to fact-check it, that fact-checking deliberations are often non-linear and iterative, that collaborative fact-checking leads people to revise their initial judgments about the credibility of online information, and that when online information is highly salient to people’s cultural identities, they apply different standards of credibility when fact-checking it. In conclusion, we propose that cultural identity is an important factor in the fact-checking of online information, and that joint fact-checking of online information by people from diverse cultural backgrounds may have significant potential as an educational tool to reduce people’s susceptibility to misinformation.

Special attention has been paid to how social media discourse, rather than focusing on the correct identification of sources and voices, can end up constructing trust and credibility by emphasising shared identities and positions, usually in opposition to other views. Studies on “echo chambers” look at how the views of others are systematically rejected and used instrumentally to support one’s own beliefs. Twitter discourse is often a case in point. The focus of our analysis is on the language that manifests the writer’s position, starting from the concept of engagement as defined in Martin and White’s (2005) appraisal framework. This indicates the speaker’s degree of commitment to what is being expressed and manifests the speaker’s attitudes to opening and closing the dialogic space for external views. Using a corpus of tweets and one of journalistic texts on the pandemic, we test the hypothesis that the space given to dialogic contraction on Twitter may be wider than that provided by traditional journalism. The study - based on frequency analysis, concordance analysis, and word embedding - centres on a predefined list of appraisal markers indicating contraction or expansion. We look at the relative frequency of these markers and at their role in the ongoing debate. The results show that there are specific markers that dominate Twitter discourse: adversative “but”, negative “no”/“not”, and cognitive verbs like “know” and “think”. A closer analysis of concordances of negatives and cognitive verbs shows that it is possible to identify patterns that are clear signals of explicit denials, whether in representing a position or rejecting it, and that the verbs are used as markers of ideological positioning. Twitter thus turns out to be characterised by positioning that emphasises contrasting views and denial of other positions. (302 words). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

Now that news is dislocated from dedicated outlets of news organizations, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish from other cultural forms, including entertainment, advertising and misinformation. Especially on visual social media, where many different forms, topics and tones circulate, so-called “news feeds” offer blends of content that only partially match traditional journalistic conceptualizations. This paper advances current conceptual debates around news(-ness), by going beyond what is culturally accepted and cognitively recognized as news. We make an argument for the importance of capturing young people’s affective and tacit understandings of news, by analyzing what feels like news to them on Instagram. These judgments matter because what users understand as news or non-news also affects their assessments of trustworthiness and reliability. Drawing upon a three-wave study (2020-2022) employing in-depth interviews with and walk-throughs of the Instagram feeds of N = 111 Dutch smartphone users (aged 16-25), we find that while young people are strongly aware of societal norms around what news is or should be, these cognitive understandings do not necessarily align with what they experience as news(-like) within their everyday practices. Although some users do employ traditional journalistic conceptualizations of news, others negotiate or challenge such definitions through processes of compartmentalization, homogenization or reconceptualization, to mitigate tensions between what they cognitively recognize versus what they affectively perceive as news. Consequently, we argue that more inclusive epistemological approaches are needed to comprehend young people’s shifting experiences of news and conceptualize news from an audience perspective. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175558293"

To better understand factors that influence media credibility, the researchers conducted a survey across a nationwide sample of US adults (N = 413). Study participants evaluated the credibility of a political news article about the congressional response to the insurrection and assessed the likelihood they would share the article on social media. Additionally, a survey of hostile media perceptions was conducted to determine potential correlations between online behaviors and offline political ideologies. Study findings offer evidence of political affiliation as a strong predictor for specific cognitive heuristic processes related to political incidents and online news.

To Blacks, this iconography delivers a clear message of White supremacy. Six states have enacted laws to protect and preserve these memorials, making it almost impossible to use the court system to move them to private property. This paper explores connections between support for a myth called the Lost Cause, which is a revisionist history intended to spread misinformation about the true cause of the American Civil War, and attitudes toward placement of Confederate symbols on public land. We show that there is significant belief in the Lost-Cause myth among many White U.S. Southerners. Furthermore, we find those who believe most in the myth are the least likely to want to move the monuments or end taxpayer support for their maintenance. © (2023).

This leads to more “consultations” of LLMs about personal medical symptoms. Objective: This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance in answering clinical case–based questions in otorhinolaryngology (ORL) in comparison to ORL consultants’ answers. Methods: We used 41 case-based questions from established ORL study books and past German state examinations for doctors. The questions were answered by both ORL consultants and ChatGPT 3. ORL consultants rated all responses, except their own, on medical adequacy, conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility using a 6-point Likert scale. They also identified (in a blinded setting) if the answer was created by an ORL consultant or ChatGPT. Additionally, the character count was compared. Due to the rapidly evolving pace of technology, a comparison between responses generated by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 was included to give an insight into the evolving potential of LLMs. Results: Ratings in all categories were significantly higher for ORL consultants (P<.001). Although inferior to the scores of the ORL consultants, ChatGPT’s scores were relatively higher in semantic categories (conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility) compared to medical adequacy. ORL consultants identified ChatGPT as the source correctly in 98.4% (121/123) of cases. ChatGPT’s answers had a significantly higher character count compared to ORL consultants (P<.001). Comparison between responses generated by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 showed a slight improvement in medical accuracy as well as a better coherence of the answers provided. Contrarily, neither the conciseness (P=.06) nor the comprehensibility (P=.08) improved significantly despite the significant increase in the mean amount of characters by 52.5% (n= (1470-964)/964; P<.001). Conclusions: While ChatGPT provided longer answers to medical problems, medical adequacy and conciseness were significantly lower compared to ORL consultants’ answers. LLMs have potential as augmentative tools for medical care, but their “consultation” for medical problems carries a high risk of misinformation as their high semantic quality may mask contextual deficits. © 2023 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180330765"

As democratic societies emerged in Europe, so did journalistic outlets that interpreted political issues, scrutinized politicians, and shaped public opinion. The lofty Fourth Estate-watchdog of governments and educator of publics-is a key pillar upholding mature democracies. But the stability of that pillar depends on public trust, rooted in expectations of accuracy and objectivity. A number of factors may undermine that trust, including the publication-either intentional or accidental-of false stories, fabrication of sources, and manipulation or misinterpretation of facts. Moreover, trust declines in the wake of public accusations of falsehood and bias even when stories are fair and true. This chapter explores key moments in the history of journalism when truth prevailed and publics counted on news outlets as crucial components of democratic life, as well as cases when journalists fell short of the expected standards or the allegations of political adversaries proved too difficult to overcome in the public eye. Moreover, the chapter emphasizes the importance of a diverse media landscape to an informed democracy, highlighting alternative outlets that have taken up the mantle as journalistic pillars of democracy when mainstream organizations have failed in that regard. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Melita M.

The overabundance of scientific news published during the pandemic made it extremely difficult for much of the lay public to assess the reliability of the information made available by conventional and unconventional news outlets. Particularly challenging to assess were news articles which, while not reporting any falsehood, failed to report scientific findings accurately, thus (typically unwittingly) contributing to spreading misinformation. This study outlines a model for understanding and assessing this type of scientific news reporting, which is here called “semi-fake” news. The model relies on the notions of framing, relevance, and argumentative fallacy to provide a comprehensive account of the way in which scientific news reporting can end up being fallacious even while not being false. The informal fallacy of “wrenching from context”, coupled with framing strategies which heighten the relevance of some aspects of the original scientific findings over others, appears to play a key role in common instances of semi-fake news. The model offers useful insights into the mechanisms leading to the production of misleading news and can be used in both news literacy programmes and in news reporting training and guidelines aimed at prospective science reporters. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Stefania M.

Our research, based on a demographic study (N = 2007) carried out in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic, used a multifactor news credibility indicator to explore how different types of sources affected the perceived credibility of a fake news item on COVID-19 in the written digital press format. We also performed a cluster analysis to determine the subgroups profiled according to key sociodemographic variables (age, gender, and education). Our results indicate that expert and political sources had a null effect on news credibility, while citizen and celebrity sources had a clear negative effect. Furthermore, our fake news story that did not cite sources was awarded a positive level of credibility.

This study investigated the impact and management of mis/disinformation at university libraries in Australia through a survey of 88 library staff and interviews with 17 managers. Library staff believe they have a role in teaching skills such as critical thinking and evaluation, advocating in this space and maintaining credible, balanced and inclusive collections. Although combating mis/disinformation is a strategic priority for libraries, it is often not a priority for the institutions themselves, leading to barriers for staff who would like to devote more time and resources to teaching information literacy skills and assessing the credibility and accuracy of collections. While complaints about collection content are low and library managers’ view is that libraries should not censor materials, there is an increasing priority in Australia to address historical inaccuracies in content and build and maintain collections that are inclusive and culturally safe. Library staff in Australia would like support from national library bodies through training and resources and playing an advocacy role in national discussions around mis/disinformation. © 2023 The Author(s).

They are more likely to attribute false information to deliberative deception than to a lack of access to the war area or inaccurate expert knowledge.

Our results support the integrative model in the perception of misinformation—we found strong evidence of myside bias, as pro-Russia misinformation was judged to be significantly less accurate than pro-Ukraine misinformation. Analytical thinking, measured with the seven-item cognitive reflection test, was associated with lower levels of pro-Ukraine misinformation accuracy judgments and lower overall misinformation accuracy judgments; however, there was no correlation between analytical thinking and pro-Russian misinformation accuracy judgments. Pro-Ukrainian misinformation accuracy judgments were positively related to positive emotions elicited by misinformation, the level of support for Ukraine, and the participant's age. In addition, participants indicated a higher likelihood of engaging with misinformation if they came across it online, trusted the information, and if it elicited positive emotions.

We address this question by leveraging the most comprehensive data on Trump's repetition of misleading claims during his presidency. In a national survey asking Americans to evaluate the truth of claims from this database, we find a clear partisan asymmetry. An increase in the number of repetitions of a falsehood corresponded with increased belief among Republicans but decreased belief among Democrats. We also find an important moderating role of media consumption.

Therefore, understanding consumer behavior when they are exposed to SM fake news is important. From the perspective of information asymmetry and signaling theory, this study derives that the negative effect of fake news on consumer trust is further reinforced in the presence of information asymmetry. Conversely, vendors’ signal credibility and consumers’ perceived vendor reputation diminish the effect of SM fake news on consumer trust. Our research model is empirically validated via an online survey. The results support these three moderation effects. In addition, the results indicate that consumers’ brand bias is a direct predictor of consumer purchase behavior. The findings suggest development of strategies for marketing managers and executives to mitigate the impact of SM fake news by signaling techniques.

Discursive boundary-work takes the form of users repeatedly centering “true” or “correct” information, referencing experts and studies, and claiming the “other” is misunderstanding and misusing information or spreading (mis)information. However, these boundary-work as content moderation practices are not just about delineating between truth and falsehood; they are about users building and reinforcing norms of use, groups, relationships, and identities as well as the digital space for acceptance.

It is argued that online users turn primarily to attitude-confirming content (selective exposure effects) which amplifies existing opinions and societal polarization. However, with the increasing prevalence of online disinformation and fake news, it is also likely that people will be exposed to disinformation that contradicts their current beliefs. Regarding the controversial issue of anthropogenic climate change, we elucidate how users react when they are (incidentally) exposed to counter-attitudinal anthropogenity-denying fake news by investigating their search and selection behavior after the exposure. The innovative research design of our case study includes pre- and post-surveys, stimulus exposure, and content analyses of web activities (n = 39). Importantly, the exposure to climate-change-denying fake news decreased acceptance of climate change and its human causes. Selection behavior was mainly attitude-confirming, while search behavior was more diverse. Journalistic sources were used most often and for longest. Individual characteristics affected searches and selections. KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS In the information-saturated online environment comprising scientifically correct and incorrect information, users are frequently exposed to counter-attitudinal fake news, e.g. videos denying anthropogenic climate change. After exposure to an attitude-opposing fake news video, participants’ climate change acceptance decreased. In a free internet search after stimulus exposure, attitude-confirming anthropogenity-accepting positions and journalistic content dominated users’ selection but not search behavior. Future climate change-related communication activities should note that participants who stated they knew little about climate change knowledge were mainly interested in solution-oriented websites.

Overall, public trust in journalism remains low (44% globally), according to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2021. Building on a growing body of research on predictors of (dis)trust among news audiences, this study examines survey data from the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2021 to explore distrust profiles—comparative profiles of users based on their relative distrust in news in general, news they consume, and news accessed through digital intermediaries like social and search—across distinct news environments: India, South Korea, and the US. We conclude that, across all three countries, there are large segments who either trust everything or distrust everything, suggesting a trust polarization phenomenon. Moreover, the results identify segments of swing trusters, users who trust some news and distrust other types but do not indicate a blanket tendency to trust or distrust everything. Normative expectations about the institution of journalism (i.e., folk theories) seem to be the most powerful factors in explaining the relative likelihood of membership in all profiles, where expectations regarding impartiality, concern about fake news, and fair coverage were important indicators of (dis)trust, with varying degrees depending on the media, political, and technological contexts in which they are situated. These findings suggest that to regain trust, journalists should consider how they can change people’s folk theories when it comes to news by comprehensively taking into account the unique trajectory of a given country’s media system. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178960130"

Our objective is to analyze these two aspects in the context of COVID-19 in Spain. Also, we seek to identify the sociodemographic and political factors that determine them. We employed a quantitative survey run through an online panel (n=682). The results indicate that disinformation generates, as the primary effect, an increase in mistrust towards the media and politicians among Spanish citizens. Likewise, the incidence of disinformation in the change of opinion and the decision to vote has dropped. Concerning Coronavirus, falsehoods had a low impact on vaccination, although they promoted conspiracy theories among citizens. Men, young people and far-right sympathizers perceive the consequences of deception more intensely. Finally, the work of fact-checking agencies and legislation are the mechanisms to combat disinformation that citizens consider most reliable.

Throughout the unfolding of the scandal, unconfirmed and often salacious information about what had happened was transmitted among individuals and amplified through the media. The chapter takes a close look at some key elements contributing to such trends, including use of anonymous sourcing, heightened competition between media outlets, and the emergence of new media actors covering American politics and the presidency. An analysis of two specific incidents, involving coverage of allegations there were eyewitnesses to the president’s affair with Monica Lewinsky and that Lewinsky had a dress stained with the president’s DNA in her possession, demonstrates how prominent national news outlets publicized information reflecting weaker reporting standards and conveyed unsubstantiated rumors as news. As the news media devalued itself in cases such as this one, abandoning professional conventions and prioritizing sensational, entertaining content, the public began to no longer trust or rely on such sources to help it interpret events. We continue to see the ramifications of those developments in the present, with widespread belief in fake news, little consensus on what constitute facts or reality, and stark partisan divides about who can be relied upon to transmit the truth of political events. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163820137"

When making important decisions regarding self-care, people must have effective sex education, in which protection is of vital importance, since misinformation is one of the main factors that promotes cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on the knowledge of cervical cancer prevention in a group of nursing students and their families under the Nola Pender model. The method used in the study was a quasi-experimental, non-probabilistic sample; the knowledge about cervical cancer prevention and control was evaluated before and after the intervention, using the survey validated by Dr. Dina Rubio in 2009 (with her consent). The information was included in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: the items were placed in columns and the subjects were included in the rows. Specific frequencies and absolute frequencies were calculated, the Nola Pender model was used for the analysis. The units of analysis were selected manually or randomly and these selections do not depend on probability but are generated based on the criteria of the researcher or the specific needs of the research. From a statistical point of view, information about what cervical cancer is, what it implies and how it behaves as a risk is engrained in the mental structure of the participants. To these implications of a technical and methodological nature, others of a structural and conceptual nature are added to build an integrative analysis of the results obtained in the field work. In this case, they include opinions, appraisals, judgments, and evaluations about cervical cancer. This research was organized in the following stages: (1) Evaluation of prior knowledge on cervical cancer prevention and control. The starting point of the investigation was the recognition that the participating women had a basic conceptual scaffolding, acquired through their own experience and self-training or by going to sources such as academia, social networks, specialized magazines, health institutions, medical staff and other specialists who help in the creation of an important background to consolidate an individual perspective. (2) Application of an educational intervention. In this stage, designed workshops were implemented and evaluated by the students with the advice of a teacher, and included the following topics: general concepts, signs and symptoms, associated risk factors, screening techniques, benefits, and exam precautions. The students contributed a theoretical, methodological and evaluative foundation to the design of each workshop, considering the expected training objectives, the characteristics included in its development, and a diversity of pedagogical actions that guarantee the efficiency of the transmitted message. (3) Reevaluation of the knowledge acquired. By applying a post-test, the knowledge acquired during the implementation of the workshops was recovered and resized. In this stage, the variability of the responses measured the transforming effect of the training, either by improving the knowledge acquired or by introducing new knowledge into the participant’s cognitive model. The perception that participants have about self-care practices is linked to their beliefs, denoting a favorable level of awareness and clarity, which makes it possible for the application of cytology to recognize the frequency of use, regularity over time, and attention to the results. In conclusion, when evaluating the impact of educational intervention through the Nola Pender model, changes in knowledge were found. Results also indicate that this is an ideal model for employees in heterogeneous popu lation groups in ages, educational levels, professional training, and sexual habits, because it integrates personal experience, the environment and health practices as three elements without which it is not possible to practice self-care and the culture of intervention. © (2023), All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166359361"

As COVID-19 creates risks of seriously damaging health effects, fear of this disease is as a significant determinant of vaccination intentions, as indicated by past research. Nevertheless, this positive influence may be limited in people who do not consider vaccines as a solution to protect against COVID-19, especially those who hold conspiracist beliefs about the new coronavirus and, implicitly, about the newly developed vaccines. The present study examined in a cross-sectional design on a convenience sample (N = 564) the joint effect of fear of COVID-19 and conspiracist beliefs on vaccination intentions, advancing past research on their independent influences. Furthermore, we investigated and controlled the effects of perceived risk of catching COVID-19, trust in medical experts, attitude towards vaccination and socio-demographical characteristics (i.e., gender, age, and education), previously found to be associated to COVID-19 vaccination intentions. We also tested the effect of ambivalence towards vaccination, i.e., the degree to which people simultaneously hold positive and negative evaluations of this intervention, as the widespread misinformation on the new coronavirus and its vaccines may induce ambivalence on this latter issue in many people. The results showed that the positive effect of fear of COVID-19 on vaccination intentions emerged only in participants who tend not to endorse conspiracist ideas on the new coronavirus. Moreover, higher vaccine hesitancy was found in participants with higher ambivalence towards vaccination, in those who perceive the risk of being contaminated by the new coronavirus as low, and in those with more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. Vaccine ambivalence also emerged as a mediator of the negative effects of conspiracist beliefs about COVID-19 on vaccination intentions. This pattern of findings suggests the public messages emphasizing the risks of COVID-19 should also combat misinformation in order to maximize vaccine uptake.

In Thailand, false information on COVID-19 vaccines created anti-government sentiments and had a negative impact on public health. The Thai government tried to suppress false information by launching a centralised COVID-19 information centre. It also announced an Emergency Decree on 26 March 2020 that placed the country in lockdown. Its other measures included appointing official spokespersons and setting up a Facebook page for the Centre for the COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) to control communication of the emerging situation. The Anti-Fake News Centre, a fact checking unit under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES), legitimised the government’s claims as truths during the crisis. As a result, tensions among government agencies, journalists and netizens arose. This chapter adopts an ecology approach to examine how the Thai government combatted online falsehoods during the pandemic. It explores online falsehoods through three waves of the pandemic crisis and provides an analysis of how the Thai government attempted to control communication through laws and regulations, actions by government agencies and through social media campaigns. This chapter also discusses the gap between government information and citizens’ trust regarding the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine using data collected from social listening tool Zocial Eye.

Research has shown that politically affiliated individuals may be particularly vulnerable to disinformation in part due to confirmation bias or the tendency to accept and seek out information that is consistent with one’s preex-isting beliefs and ignore or refute information that is not. Using the quantitative method and cross‐matched data from the empirical research, the study has shown that political affiliation affects the way individuals perceive disinformation. Correspondingly, disinformation with a negative connotation from one’s affiliated political party is perceived by a lower percentage as accurate, contrary to disinformation with a negative connotation from the opposing political party, which is perceived by a higher percentage as accurate. The study also found that politically affiliated individuals are more prone to disinformation than those who are not politically affiliated. The results suggest that political affiliation plays a significant role in an individual’s vulnerability to disinformation. © 2023 by the author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154072520"

We discovered strong predictive validity across several outcome measures (e.g., epistemically suspect beliefs, bullshit receptivity, empathy, moral judgments), with some subscales having stronger predictive validity for some outcomes but not others.

Therefore, we introduce V e r i f ication d o n e, a nuanced interpretation schema and assessment tool that simultaneously considers V eracity discernment, and its distinct, measurable abilities (r eal/ f ake news detection), and biases (d istrust/n aïvité—negative/positive judgment bias). We then conduct three studies with seven independent samples (N total = 8504) to show how to develop, validate, and apply the Misinformation Susceptibility Test (MIST). In Study 1 (N = 409) we use a neural network language model to generate items, and use three psychometric methods—factor analysis, item response theory, and exploratory graph analysis—to create the MIST-20 (20 items; completion time < 2 minutes), the MIST-16 (16 items; < 2 minutes), and the MIST-8 (8 items; < 1 minute). In Study 2 (N = 7674) we confirm the internal and predictive validity of the MIST in five national quota samples (US, UK), across 2 years, from three different sampling platforms—Respondi, CloudResearch, and Prolific. We also explore the MIST’s nomological net and generate age-, region-, and country-specific norm tables. In Study 3 (N = 421) we demonstrate how the MIST—in conjunction with V e r i f ication d o n e—can provide novel insights on existing psychological interventions, thereby advancing theory development. Finally, we outline the versatile implementations of the MIST as a screening tool, covariate, and intervention evaluation framework. As all methods are transparently reported and detailed, this work will allow other researchers to create similar scales or adapt them for any population of interest. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163578223"

The first goal was to determine the extent to which conspiracy theories affect how undergraduates explain and understand crises and events. For example, theories about secret government cabals controlling Iraqi citizens’ lives and other issues. The second objective is to apply COVID-19 as a case to determine the extent of the conspiratorial interpretation of the sprea)d of the virus through exposure to misinformation through social media and how social media impacted it. The study was recruited from a snowball sample of students in two universities in Baghdad. Sample size 331 (230 males and 101 females) aged 19–24. They were surveyed through phone interviews. The study applied media dependency and conspiracy theories in survey research on a snowball sample in two major public universities in Baghdad. The survey shows undergraduate students depend on conspiracies from social media, especially Facebook. Moreover, the study finds that students believe in government malfeasance. In contrast, many students believe in multiple COVID-19 conspiracies, global government conspiracies, scientific conspiracies, extraterrestrial coverups, and government conspiracies meant to cause personal harm. Finally, there was no significant difference between males and females in dependence on media or scale of conspiracy belief. © 2023 The Author(s).

While Y is not itself misinformation (Y is factually correct), A suspects B might take Y as important evidence for not-X; (iv) A deliberately chooses not to mention Y to B, out of a concern that it could mislead B into believing not-X; and, (v) B has no compelling reason to expect A will avoid mentioning Y in this way. A’s behavior is rational insofar as A aims to use reasons to persuade B to believe a thesis that A holds as true and justified. Yet it is manipulation because A deliberately avoids furnishing B with information that B might regard as relevant, to ensure B arrives at the correct belief. I argue that we have good reason to think that A’s action will be wrongly manipulative because it disrespects B’s consent, epistemic autonomy, and personal autonomy. That said, context is critical, and there are many times evidence is intentionally occluded that are not rational manipulation.

Specifically, we argue that the perceived capability to analyze and reflect critically on the reliability of online information sources should be stayed with the perceived self-regulatory capability to resist online social pressures to share unverifiable news. Moreover, we posited that specific online self-efficacies beliefs can be promoted by the capabilities related to regulating emotions and reflecting on new problems. In a sample of 273, we tested a path analysis model. The results attest that self-efficacy beliefs in dealing with online misinformation refer to specific capabilities: an active one, related to checking the sources of the news in order to validate their content, and an inhibitory one, related to the capability to refrain from sharing the news that seems unreliable. Moreover, self-efficacy beliefs in self-control during online interaction spreading misleading news are supported by cognitive reflective capability and self-efficacy in regulating negative emotion. The relationship between active self-efficacy related to fact-checking and sharing misleading news is not significant.

Misinformation has cast doubt on the integrity of democratic elections, downplayed the seriousness of COVID-19, and increased vaccine hesitancy. Given the leading role that online groups play in the dissemination of fake news, in this research we examined how group-level factors contribute to sharing misinformation. By unobtrusively tracking interactions among 51,537 Twitter user dyads longitudinally over two time periods (n= 103,074), we found that group members who did not conform to the behavior of other group members by sharing fake news were subjected to reduced social interaction over time.We augmented this unique, ecologically valid behavioral data with another digital field study (N= 178,411) and five experiments to disentangle some of the causal mechanisms driving the observed effects. We found that social costs were higher for not sharing fake news versus other content, that specific types of deviant group members faced the greatest social costs, and that social costs explained fake news sharing above and beyond partisan identity and subjective accuracy assessments.

We are now in the era of the self-informative program; the hierarchical dimension of sources has vanished in parallel to the collapse of the authority, credibility, and trustworthiness of classical sources. Now, the user creates his own informative program, which gives rise to a new relationship between digital individuals. With this framework in mind, I intend to analyze the narrative of this post-pandemic phase proposed by mainstream media, using the tool of the fake news hexagon, to verify the impact and spread of fake news through social networks where emotionalism, hate speech, and polarization are accentuated. In fact, the definition of the fake news hexagon was the starting point to study through a predefined method the dynamics of proliferation of fake news to activate correct identification and blocking tools, in line with what is defined in the Digital Transformation Institute's manifesto.1 Platforms drive the process of identity construction within containers that adapt to the demands of individuals, leading toward a flattening out of results from web searches as these follow the principle of confirmation bias. We assist to an increasing lack of recognition of the other, the individual moves away from commitment, sacrifice, and achieving a higher collective good. It becomes quite evident how, in the face of the collapse of authority, as this new dimension takes hold, the understanding of reality and the construction of public identity can no longer be the result of the ability to decipher messages alone. Media and social multidimensionality necessitate developing new interpretive processes.

Background: Theoretical research provides support for the notion that the same users likely fall for multiple forms of online deception. However, no research has directly compared susceptibility for various online deceptions (eg phishing, disinformation, scam text messages) within the same group of users. Method: Participants completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions, the Cognitive Reflection Test (ie impulsivity), and the Digital Literacy Scale, and classified 90 legitimate and deceptive emails, text messages, and news headlines. Results: Results suggest that individuals who struggle to discriminate between deceptive and legitimate stimuli on one task experience similar difficulties on the other two tasks. Additionally, while lower levels of digital literacy and cognitive reflectiveness predicted poorer discrimination abilities across all three tasks, age did not predict performance. Interestingly, participants appeared to be the most susceptible to phishing emails. Conclusion: Overall, individuals who fall for one form of online deception appear to be more likely to fall for other forms of deception, and digital literacy and cognitive reflectiveness can predict widespread vulnerability to online deception. Application: Organizations may be able to identify potential vulnerabilities for a variety of online attacks by measuring digital literacy, cognitive reflectiveness, and performance in one online deception task. Additionally, training interventions may be the most needed for phishing emails. © 2023, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158824364"

Drawing on qualitative analysis of two leading figures of the anti-vaccination movement – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Joseph Mercola – we demonstrate how these influencers establish authority by staging indignation against a corrupt scientific establishment and positioning themselves as Truthers offering simple solutions to complex (wicked) problems. By conceptualising what we refer to as the Truther Playbook, we examine how anti-vaccine Truthers capitalise on existing grievances and conditions of low institutional trust to further solidify people’s troubled relationship with institutional expertise while drawing attention to the structural conditions and social inequalities that facilitate belief in conspiracy theories. We contend that conspiracy theories offer not only offer alternative facts and narratives but are predicated on identification and in-group membership, highlighting the limits of debunking as a strategy to tackle disinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163040395"

Numerous cognitive and socio-cognitive factors underlie misinformation reliance and the continued influence effect. Cognitive factors include limitations in memory capacity as well as memory updating and knowledge revision capabilities; socio-cognitive factors include biassed reasoning and perceived source credibility. Although misinformation is not a new problem, social media and instant messaging platforms have dramatically changed the information transmission environment, with their unregulated and user-controlled nature increasing the ease with which misinformation can be created and propagated. Drawing insights from cognitive, social and political psychology, the current chapter provides a general overview of the cognitive and social factors underlying (1) misinformation belief, and (2) the continued influence effect of corrected misinformation. The discussion focuses on how the unique nature of online information acquisition, specifically characteristics of both open and closed online communication networks, not only creates an environment ideal for the spread of misinformation, but functions to inhibit accurate knowledge revision. The chapter concludes by providing specific recommendations for how to effectively mitigate the spread of misinformation within the online information ecosystem.

Attempts to slow the spread of misinformation by platforms such as Facebook and Twitter include adding fact-checking labels to social media posts, the effectiveness of which remains unclear. Using two experiments, we tested the credibility effects of fact-checking labels (confirmed vs. disputed) on graphical presentations of political (Democrat vs. Republican) quotes and social media news posts. Study 1 (N = 312) tested the effects of these labels on political social media posts with political quotes, and Study 2 (N = 356) replicated and extended this research to a news story post about a politician. Results indicate that the valence of verification labels on their own do not affect perceptions of the content. Instead, users find corrections of opposite-party political figures more credible and are more willing to share content when it negatively portrays opposite-party political figures. These results demonstrate potential limitations of fact-checking labels and highlight the importance of considering political ideology in correcting misinformation on social media sites. © 2023 SAGE Publications.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161714211"

Participants watched a fictionalized crime video, received post-event misinformation about the video, and completed a cued recall memory test. They were randomly assigned to complete either a brief mindfulness exercise or unrelated task prior to encoding the video (E1) or prior to the final cued recall test (E2). Further, half of the participants in each group were informed that their assigned task was beneficial to memory performance. In Experiment 1, information about task benefits reduced misinformation reports on the final recall test, regardless of the task. The brief mindfulness exercise increased self-reported mindfulness scores in both experiments. While no group differences in memory were found, correlational analyses across the two experiments suggest that individuals who achieve more intense states of mindfulness may have lower susceptibility to misinformation and better event memory when meditation occurs prior to encoding. The results suggest that brief mindfulness exercises can reliably increase state experiences of mindfulness and have potential for use as experimental manipulations. However, the intensity of a self-guided mindfulness experience can vary across individuals, so it is important to consider individual differences when considering the application of the exercises. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150890506"

Therefore, they may be susceptible to believing misinformation because evidence that others share their beliefs provides “social proof” that they can expect interactions with others to be positive and rewarding. The present research examined whether alternatively fulfilling the need for social connection through romantic relationships could protect conspiracy theorists against COVID-19 misinformation. In a 3-week daily diary study (N = 555), experimental participants implicitly learned to associate their romantic partners with positive experiences (by repeatedly pairing their partner with highly positive and approachable stimuli, McNulty et al., 2017). We then assessed how much participants trusted individuals they might normally distrust, as a manipulation check, and how much participants tuned their daily personal beliefs and behavior to match the U.S. public's daily susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. Participants high on conspiratorial thinking trusted fellow community members more in the experimental than control condition. Participants high on conspiratorial thinking in the experimental condition were also less likely to treat the U.S. public's greater daily susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation as proof that they could discount the virus.

They see this as a discursive tool used by politicians to deflect critical reporting, delegitimise media outlets and achieve other political ends, suggesting that abuse of such deflections can benefit these political actors. Theoretically, ‘fake news’ deflections in the face of emergent derogatory information may benefit politicians by allowing them to maintain the support and trust of citizens as well as reduce belief in the accusation–as long as the deceit is not exposed. To evaluate this hypothesis, a survey experiment (n = 1,420) was conducted, varying how British PM Boris Johnson responded to two separate damaging accusations. This enabled the assessment of the impact of the ensuing fake news deflections on UK citizens’ belief in the accusation and also their opinion of the politician. Results show that employing fake news deflections reduces the respondents’ belief in the accusation, increases support for the politician, and generally increases perceptions of his truthfulness. However, when the deflection is revealed to be false and the politician’s deceit is exposed, citizens will revise their belief in the story, as well as punish the politician by significantly reducing their perception of his truthfulness and their support for him. Thus, while fake news deflections of emergent derogatory information are likely to reduce a citizen’s belief in these allegations and muster political support, rampant abuse of fake news deflections may ultimately erode citizens’ trust and support for the politician. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162764272"

While earlier studies have suggested a negative relationship between social media news consumption and factual knowledge, there are indications that social media use may give people a general sense of being informed, even when they are not. Such general subjective knowledge might, however, differ from confidence in retrieved facts. Drawing on a two-wave panel study from Norway, we find evidence of a negative relationship between social media news consumption and both dimensions of knowledge. Notably, however, we do not find that social media news use leads to confidence in incorrect beliefs, suggesting that the digital media environment produces an uninformed, but not an overconfident, misinformed news audience. © Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

A two-wave panel survey experiment shows that when people’s skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by accuracy motivations, they are less likely to believe in congruent misinformation later encountered. They also consume more mainstream media, which in turn reinforces accuracy-motivated skepticism. In contrast, when skepticism toward social media misinformation is driven by identity motivations, people not only fall for congruent misinformation later encountered, but also disregard platform interventions that flag a post as false. Moreover, they are more likely to see social media misinformation as favoring opponents and intentionally avoid news on social media, both of which form a vicious cycle of fueling more identity-motivated skepticism. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163392283"

Across waves, 0.1%–3.4% of our sample were certain the selected conspiracy theories were true, though this belief was unstable over time. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models revealed that individuals’ temporary level of conspiracy beliefs did not significantly depend on their temporary level of media use at a previous occasion, or vice versa. However, significant correlations at the group level indicated that more frequent use of health-related and social media sources were associated with higher levels of conspiracy beliefs.

To address this gap, this study focused on researchers (i.e., academics and scientists from different fields, including clinical researchers and medical doctors) who conducted research activities on COVID-19-related topics in three Southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Using an approach that combined survey data (n = 317) with semi-structured interviews (n = 40), we explored researchers' personal beliefs, opinions, and experiences regarding their encounters with the media during the pandemic. Our results show that researchers' motivations, concerns, and benefits in their interactions with the media remained largely unchanged during the pandemic.

Several practices to promote and maintain trustful and fruitful cooperation with journalists were also identified. Additionally, lessons learned were extracted from the interactions between researchers and journalists during the pandemic. They hold particular relevance in a context of uncertainty, fake news, high demand for information and high expectations in science and technology.

Finally, disinformation causes the diplomatic corps to abandon its traditional discretion and forces it to discuss matters in public and on social media. This shift from the private to the public makes diplomatic culture uncomfortable. There is no simple solution to the problem of disinformation because it operates with emotions, not facts or arguments. The challenge for diplomats is twofold.

Journalism, which has traditionally acted as a watchdog and a check on power, is now in the midst of a credibility crisis, compounded by polarization and the rise of disinformation. For this reason, various studies advocate that media outlets, just like institutions and governments, should use transparency mechanisms that allow them to respond directly or indirectly to society regarding the content they publish, as an exercise of responsibility. This research aims to evaluate media transparency in the Spanish–Portuguese landscape by means of an index that includes variables studied in the theoretical framework and that come from legislative, academic, and professional sources. These variables have been used to measure corporate and financial transparency, transparency in content production, openness to public participation, and the self-regulation mechanisms of ten media outlets in Spain and Portugal. This study concluded that, with only 43% adherence to the transparency variables analyzed, promoting accountability is still a work in progress for media outlets, and it must be stepped up at both the academic and professional levels. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Our data are a subset of in-depth interviews with 33 participants in a larger program of longitudinal qualitative fieldwork (N = 102) we conducted over 16 months. Participants could also donate examples of misinformation via our customized smartphone application. We find that some participants created group rules to mitigate what they saw as messaging’s harmful affordances. In the context of personalized trust relationships, these affordances were perceived as making it likely that misinformation would harm social ties. Rules reduce the vulnerability and can stimulate metacommunication that, over time, fosters norms of collective reflection and epistemic vigilance, although the impact differs subtly according to group size and membership. Subject to further exploration, group rulemaking could reduce the spread of online misinformation. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159075601"

We conducted a laboratory experiment based on game theory, using a modified version of the ultimatum game, where proposers had the opportunity to manipulate the responder’s beliefs by the use of ‘hide behind the small cake’ strategy. Our results contradict the selfish rationality model predictions. Intermediary financial incentives led people to adopt extremes strategies of pure fair/selfish allocation. Greater levels of financial incentive reduced the full expropriation strategy and at the same time, reduced the presence of fair offers, which suggests an interesting interaction between opportunism and psychological costs of lying. The results showed that opportunism is hugely context-dependent and people will update their decision regarding opportunism in accordance with the financial size incentive. Thus, the same person can behave differently depending on the financial value involved and will not necessarily be more selfish when the financial amount increases. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The current preregistered study investigated whether people with high memory distrust are less likely to exhibit this bias than their low memory distrust counterparts. Participants (N = 535) imagined a scenario in which they witnessed an accident and were then led by friends to question their memories about the accident. Participants had to propose five strategies for verifying that particular memory. Following this, they rated each strategy’s cost, reliability, and their likelihood of using it, as well as completing two validated measures of trait memory distrust. Contrary to our prediction, compared with participants with low memory distrust, participants with higher memory distrust exhibited a larger cheap-strategy bias. Follow-up analyses suggested that compared with memory-trusters, memory distrusters’ strategy choices were more influenced by a strategy’s perceived cost, and less influenced by its perceived reliability. Our results suggest that people who are more skeptical about their memories may be more cynical about the worthwhileness of verifying their memory, which could make them especially susceptible to misinformation acceptance and false memory creation. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study investigated possible differences in COVID-19 headline accuracy discernment and online sharing of COVID-19 misinformation between older and younger adults, as well as the role of individual differences in global cognition, health literacy and verbal IQ. Fifty-two younger (18–35 years old) and fifty older adults (age 50 and older) completed a neurocognitive battery, health literacy and numeracy measures, and self-report questionnaires via telephone. Participants also completed a social media headline-sharing experiment (Pennycook et al., Psychological science, 31(7), 770–780, 2020) in which they were presented with true and false COVID-19 headlines about which they indicated: 1) the likelihood that they would share the story on social media; and 2) the factual accuracy of the story. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance controlling for gender and race/ethnicity showed no effects of age (p =.099) but a significant interaction between actual COVID-19 headline accuracy and the likelihood of sharing (p <.001), such that accuracy was more strongly related to sharing false headlines (r = −.64) versus true headlines (r = −.43). Moreover, a higher likelihood of sharing false COVID-19 headlines was associated with lower verbal IQ and numeracy skills in older adults (rs = −.51--.40) and with lower verbal IQ, numeracy, and global cognition in younger adults (rs = −.66--.60). Findings indicate that headline accuracy judgements, numeracy, and verbal IQ are important contributors to sharing COVID-19 misinformation in both older and younger adults.

This study uses the information adoption model (IAM) as the theoretical framework to examine the moderating influence of perceived government information transparency on the adoption of COVID-19 pandemic information on social media systems from the Ghanaian perspective. Government information transparency regarding the pandemic is crucial since any lack of transparency can negatively affect the global response to the pandemic by destroying trust (in government and public health authorities/institutions), intensifying fears, and causing destructive behaviors. Methods: It applies a convenient sampling technique to collect the responses from 516 participants by using self-administrated questionnaires. The data analysis was computed and analyzed with SPSS-22. The following statistical tests were conducted to test the hypotheses: descriptive statistics, scale reliability test, Pearson bivariate correlation, multiple linear regressions, hierarchical regression, and slope analysis. Results: The results indicate that information quality, information credibility, and information usefulness are significant drivers of COVID-19 pandemic information adoption on social media systems. Furthermore, the perceived government information transparency positively moderates the influence of information quality, information credibility, and information usefulness on the adoption of COVID-19 pandemic information on social media systems. Conclusion: The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings suggest the utilization of social media systems as an effective tool to support the continued fight against the current COVID-19 pandemic and its future role in national and global public health emergencies.

This study examined how media coverage, myths, political leaders, and community leaders influence the attitudes and misconceptions about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination uptake in the Mississippi Delta region. This qualitative study employed focus group discussions (FDGs) with representatives from three rural counties in the Mississippi Delta. A thematic analysis approach was used for data analysis. Participants were aware of how COVID-19 is transmitted, the preventative measures that can be used to mitigate the spread of the virus, and misconceptions and beliefs that lingered in their communities. Participants were uncertain about the need for the COVID-19 vaccine in terms of perceived risks (e.g., side effects, efficacy, and safety) and its novelty. Participants also discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation that resulted in distress and distrust of the vaccine and health behavior recommendations. There are varying misconceptions and beliefs about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine among communities in the rural Mississippi Delta. Thus, multi-sectoral collaborations between agencies that can use risk communication frameworks to deliver accurate health information that can resolve misinformation about COVID-19 in rural communities are needed. © 2023 Taylor &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#x0026; Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159403990"

We conducted a content analysis of tweets we collected over a 30-day period (n = 419,495) and developed an iterative codebook that contained six domains (tweet source, location, tweet characteristics, COVID-19 specific topics, demographic descriptors, and sentiment) and thirty-six codes. Despite the abundance of misinformation on Twitter about the vaccine, we found that more tweets were positive than negative in tone and contained mostly reliable and up-to-date information about the vaccine. Most tweets came from individuals though many came from organizations. We found little discussion of demographic descriptors such as race/ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, nor did we see discussion of misinformation or mask-wearing. Additionally, few tweets came from politicians or political organizations, and we found little talk of politics.

Analyzing the link of digital skills achieved by students, applied in collaborative teaching methods, we established the existing relationship between information literacy (IL) and reciprocal teaching (RT) skills in Communication Sciences students; based on the classification of IL competencies in DigComp 2.1, related to skills and attitudes promoted by RT. Method: the research was anonymized, a digital questionnaire was used with 100 IL questions and 22 RT questions, both with a Likert scale with values of 0-9; the reliability of the instrument was validated by Cronbach’s Alpha with values of .987 for AI and .992 for RT, as well as the review at the discretion of 3 experts. Results: the data showed a non-normal distribution, applying Spearman’s Rho it was determined that there is a significant relationship, establishing through Multinomial Logistic Regression that the IL of level N3 predominates, concentrating 90% of cases, reflected in the 2/3 of RT concentrated in levels Low-Medium, the regression coefficients show that the low development of IL does not lead to an advanced RT. Conclusions: In Peru, the development of Digital Competencies, fundamentally the 3 dimensions of IL (navigate, evaluate and manage information), is similar to Spain, being that, evaluating it must have greater development to ensure that communicators can combat fake news, a level N3 would be insufficient, a review of the university curriculum and improving student training would be needed to achieve it, because being “digital natives” is not enough. © 2022 University of Granada.

Through focus groups with Vietnamese Americans across two generations and several geographic locations, we explore the complexities of misinformation within one such immigrant community. Findings highlight how a prevalence of intergenerational divides in political information seeking, lasting historical and political traumas of immigration, and language barriers underpin the saliency and impact of misinformation for Vietnamese Americans. Further, we explore how misinformation impacts political engagement, highlighting the consequences of misinformation at a familial and community-level.

Research suggests that multiplist epistemic beliefs may be maladaptive and lead to a radically subjective view of science. Little is known about the association between such beliefs and mistrust in science/scientists and the tendency to believe in misinformation. The aims of this study were to examine: (a) the degree to which multiplist epistemic beliefs about science are associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and science-related conspiracy beliefs, (b) the degree to which trust in science mediates the association between multiplist epistemic beliefs about science and conspiracy beliefs, and (c) the extent to which COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and science-related conspiracy beliefs are associated with compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Participants were 210 undergraduate students attending a Hispanic-serving institution located in a large city in the southern U.S. Path analysis results indicated that multiplist epistemic beliefs about science were positively associated with science-related conspiracy beliefs after accounting for fundamentalism and conservatism. Moreover, trust in science mediated the positive association between multiplist epistemic beliefs about science and COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. Finally, belief in COVID-19 conspiracies was negatively associated with COVID-19 prevention guideline compliance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159358335"

We test this hypothesis experimentally using a sample of 8,559 social media users in three post-Soviet countries.

Reasons are multifactorial and include social and structural determinants of health. During the onset and height of the pandemic, evidence suggested decreased access to SARS CoV-2 testing. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx)- Underserved Populations initiative to improve SARS CoV-2 testing in underserved communities. In this study, we explored attitudes, experiences, and barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and vaccination among New York City public housing residents. Methods Between December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted 9 virtual focus groups among 36 low-income minority residents living in New York City public housing. Results Among residents reporting a prior SARS CoV-2 test, main reasons for testing were to prepare for a medical procedure or because of a high-risk exposure. Barriers to testing included fear of discomfort from the nasal swab, fear of exposure to COVID-19 while traveling to get tested, concerns about the consequences of testing positive and the belief that testing was not necessary. Residents reported a mistrust of information sources and the health care system in general; they depended more on “word of mouth” for information. The major barrier to vaccination was lack of trust in vaccine safety. Residents endorsed more convenient testing, onsite testing at residential buildings, and home self-test kits. Residents also emphasized the need for language-concordant information sharing and for information to come from “people who look like [them] and come from the same background as [them]”. Conclusions Barriers to SARS CoV-2 testing and vaccination centered on themes of a lack of accurate information, fear, mistrust, safety, and convenience. Resident-endorsed strategies to increase testing include making testing easier to access either through home or onsite testing locations. Education and information sharing by trusted members of the community are important tools to combat misinformation and build trust. © 2023 Izeogu et al.

The salience of this label on social media and in political dis-course, and the frequent discussions held about the threats of fake news in public opinion, may result in a systematic overestimation of mis‐ and disinformation’s presence. Even more so, these primed perceptions about false information may affect people’s evaluations of factually accurate information. In this article, we offer a theoretical account of how the public’s and media’s attention to mis‐ and disinformation, fake news labels, and the threats of mis‐ and disinformation may have a negative impact on people’s trust in factually accurate information and authentic news. In addition, relying on an experimental case study of pre‐bunking interventions, we illustrate the extent to which tools intended to increase media literacy in the face of mis‐ and disinformation may also have ramifications for trust in reliable information. Based on this, we propose a forward‐looking perspective and recommendations on how interventions can circumvent unintended consequences of flagging false information. © 2023 by the author(s);.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154054118"

Using a probability sample (n = 825), we examine these factors in tandem across four political claims concerning US presidential elections and the COVID-19 pandemic. We find Democrats and Republicans differ in their belief in true and false claims, with each party believing more in pro-attitudinal claims than in counter-attitudinal claims. These results are especially pronounced for affectively polarized partisans. We also find interactions between partisanship and platform use where Republicans who use Google or Twitter are more likely to believe in false claims about COVID-19 than Republicans who do not use these platforms. Our findings highlight that Americans’ beliefs in political claims are associated with their political identity through both partisanship and polarization, and the use of search and social platforms appears critical to these relationships.

The same goes for the news. People are shifting from traditional mass media to digital news platforms and getting news through websites, news portals, social media, etc. If you are dependent on the Internet for every kind of information, then you will face false information on the Internet. False or fake news is defined as any information that does not have any credible and reliable source behind it or any misleading information that is likely to mislead the public. The aim behind fake news transmission is to damage a person's or entity's reputation or advertising revenue. If you want not to fall into the fake news you should know about fake news detection and media literacy. The main purpose of the study is to check the exposure of fake news awareness and fake news detection methods among social media users. In the current scenario, this is much necessary to know that social media users have the advisable knowledge of fake news detection and media literacy because people easily fall into the rumors. Mob lynching is one of the biggest rumors on the Indian Internet. In this research, the survey method and questionnaire for data collection were used. The questionnaire was distributed randomly over different social media platforms and emails to the intended respondents. The findings obtained reveal that most fake or false news in India is transmitted through WhatsApp, but social media users have adequate knowledge of fake news and media literacy. © Pandey B., Kumar G., Algavi L.O., Kumar M., Sharma V., 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166553734"

To address this question, this study examines not only how well (or poorly) individuals discern true and false news on social media, but also how contextual factors in news presentation and individual’s cognitive and motivational tendencies might shape the patterns of their beliefs in and likelihood to engage online news. We conducted an online survey experiment on a sample of Chinese social media users recruited from a national panel (N = 481). The results show that, first, people generally perceived social media news as accurate and were better at correctly identifying truthful news than false news, revealing both a truth bias and a veracity effect. Second, social endorsement cue and news content slant could affect how individuals judge the veracity of a news post and engage it online. Third, evidence was mixed on how individuals’ deliberative thinking propensity and epistemic motive operated. While our primary goal is to present evidence from a non-Western society to shed lights on the psychology of false news on social media, we also strive toward teasing out some implications specific to the China context. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158869748"

By contrast, tweets with second person pronouns, bald starts, or hedges were more likely to be fake news tweets. Accuracy (F1 score) was 95%. While some tweet attributes for detecting fake news might be universal (pronouns, politeness, followers), others might be topic specific (common words, emotions, hedges). © 2023 SAGE Publications.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162982857"

However, despite the rise of social media often being cited as a fundamental driver of misinformation exposure and false beliefs, how people process misinformation on social media platforms has been under-investigated. This is partially due to a lack of adaptable and ecologically valid social media testing paradigms, resulting in an over-reliance on survey software and questionnaire-based measures. To provide researchers with a flexible tool to investigate the processing and sharing of misinformation on social media, this paper presents The Misinformation Game—an easily adaptable, open-source online testing platform that simulates key characteristics of social media. Researchers can customize posts (e.g., headlines, images), source information (e.g., handles, avatars, credibility), and engagement information (e.g., a post’s number of likes and dislikes). The platform allows a range of response options for participants (like, share, dislike, flag) and supports comments. The simulator can also present posts on individual pages or in a scrollable feed, and can provide customized dynamic feedback to participants via changes to their follower count and credibility score, based on how they interact with each post. Notably, no specific programming skills are required to create studies using the simulator. Here, we outline the key features of the simulator and provide a non-technical guide for use by researchers. We also present results from two validation studies.

As information is posted without any kind of verification of its veracity, fake news has become a problem of great influence in our information driven society. Thus, to mitigate the consequences of fake news and its propagation, automated approaches to detect malicious content were created. This paper proposes an effective framework that utilizes only the text features of the news. We evaluate several features for differentiating fake from real news and we identify the best performing feature set that maximizes performance, using feature selection techniques. Text representation features were also explored as a potential solution. Additionally, the most popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models were tested to conclude to the model that achieves the maximum accuracy. Our findings reveal that a combination of linguistic features and text-based word vector representations through ensemble methods can predict fake news with high accuracy. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperformed all other models, while linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved comparable results. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163381594"

Inoculation theory has shown to be a promising vehicle to effectively neutralise the influence of misinformation on adults in various contexts. However, possible applications of inoculation theory for climate change education with young people have not been looked at yet. In this study, we investigated whether Austrian adolescents can be “inoculated” against misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change. In a quantitative randomised online survey experiment (N = 1066) based on the study of van der Linden et al. (Global Challenges 1(2):1600008, 2017), we demonstrated that adolescents are susceptible to presented misinformation targeted at the scientific consensus regarding climate change, even in the presence of accurate information. However, it is possible to pre-emptively protect adolescents against such misinformation through attitudinal inoculation. Furthermore, the inoculation treatment led to not only an increase in the adolescents’ consensus estimate but also their belief certainty in their estimate increased. We recommend future climate change education research to further elaborate possible applications of inoculation theory in climate change education or when teaching other supposedly socially controversial topics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166635072"

As a result, detecting and flagging fake news has become a critical task for social media platforms to ensure a safe environment for advertisers. Few studies have examined how fake news labeling influences the evaluation of a brand whose ad is inadvertently placed alongside fake news. We conducted three experiments using different types of fake news articles and ad stimuli to test fact-checking labeling effects. Study 1 employed a 2 (labeling vs. no labeling) x 2 (content-ad association high vs. low) between-subjects factorial design with a fake news story, disguised as real news, related to a product recall. The study findings revealed that a news story labeled as false hurts the evaluations of the adjoining ad and its brand by undermining the credibility of the story. This credibility spillover effect is moderated by the level of association between the story and the ad. Study 2 found that the same ads used in Study 1 received significantly more positive ad evaluations when they were presented in a positive non-fake news article. To determine whether the effects of labeling would be replicated in non-negative fake news, Study 3 was conducted. Even in non-negative fake news, when fact-check labeling was presented, the placed ad and its brand received significantly negative evaluations. © 2023 Western Social Science Association.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161440909"

We find that the strongest, and most reliable, predictor of perceived danger of misinformation is the third-person effect (i.e. the perception that others are more vulnerable to misinformation than the self) and, in particular, the belief that “distant” others (as opposed to family and friends) are vulnerable to misinformation. The belief that societal problems have simple solutions and clear causes was consistently, but weakly, associated with perceived danger of online misinformation. Other factors, like negative attitudes toward new technologies and higher sensitivity to threats, were inconsistently, and weakly, associated with perceived danger of online misinformation.

This comparative study investigates the role of trust in news media and political actors and general attitudes toward democracy in the willingness to spread disinformation (i.e., likes, shares, or comments). Findings of this study show that news media trust plays a subordinate role but that trust in social media news has a strong relationship with willingness to spread disinformation. In 2020, citizens in the United States and United Kingdom who had high trust in their governments were more willing to spread disinformation, whereas in France and Belgium, citizens who trusted opposition leaders were more likely to do so. Moreover, citizens who were satisfied with democracy appeared to be less vulnerable to disinformation, with the exception of those in the United States. Therefore, political actors bear great responsibility for the current (dis)information crisis because they can exploit citizens’ trust to their advantage. © 2023 The Author(s).

Particularly, we analyze how government policy responses to the pandemic and individuals' ideological predispositions interact to shape people's tendencies to believe conspiracy theories. Using survey data from 22 advanced industrial countries, we show that political conservatives are more prone to conspiracy beliefs than liberals. More importantly, this tendency is reinforced when the government adopts stringent containment policies.

In this study, we tested the model’s ability to predict adult support for COVID vaccination of children ages 5–11 after the vaccine was approved for this age group. Methods: Relying on a national panel that was established in April 2021 (N = 1941) and followed until March of 2022, we examined the relation between conspiratorial thinking measured at baseline and belief in misinformation and conspiracies about COVID vaccines, trust in various health authorities, perceived risk of COVID to children, and belief in conspiracy theories about the pandemic’s origin and impact. In addition, we tested a structural equation model (SEM) in which conspiracy mindset predicted adult support for childhood vaccination for COVID in January and March of 2022 as well as the adults own vaccination status and their willingness to recommend vaccinating children against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Results: The model accounted for 76% of the variance in support for childhood vaccination for COVID-19; the relation between the mindset and support for vaccination was entirely mediated by baseline assessments of misinformation, trust, risk, and acceptance of pandemic conspiracy theories. Discussion: The SEM replicated the prior test of the model, indicating that a conspiracy mindset present among at least 17% of the panel underlies their resistance to vaccinate both themselves and children. Efforts to counteract the mindset will likely require the intervention of trusted spokespersons who can overcome the skepticism inherent in conspiratorial thinking about the government and its health-related agencies’ recommendations for a particular vaccine.

In 2020, the most widespread xenophobic reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic was Sinophobia. In comparison, India’s response to the pandemic was both conventional and exceptional. Like other countries, India recorded a surge in Sinophobia; but –remarkably– in Islamophobia too. Turning to both history and theory, this paper investigates how Coronavirus got transformed into a ‘Muslim disease’ and connected to narratives of holy war and Islamization (‘Corona Jihad’). We contextualize the 2020 Covid-related Islamophobic wave within a longer process of demonization of the Muslim that is catalysed by the beliefs and policies of Hindu nationalism. In light of Muslims’ continuing relegation to the fringe of the Indian body-politic, we propose an interpretation of the 2020 disease-induced Islamophobia as scapegoating, based on René Girard’s mimetic theory. In conclusion, the case of Covid-19 in India confirms that in divided societies collective threats like epidemics are likely to exacerbate already existing forms of discrimination rooted in the society’s mainstream memory and norms, and highlights the role of beliefs in mediating between threat and violence. This case study also highlights the deep penetration of communal discourse in India’s everydayness and its far-reaching implications. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, its relevance has been called into question due to its controversy and ambigu-ity. We have compiled herein 30 definitions from selected dictionaries, academic papers, news agencies, influential media observatories, and independent, certified fact‐checkers over the last six years and have carried out a manual relational content analysis on them. We also collected data from four bibliometric studies from academic literature and five surveys on how the general public perceived fake news. In keeping with this three‐level systematic review (lexicography, bibliometrics, and public perception) we detected some trends, including a growing drift towards a post‐truth‐driven conceptualization of fake news. Results also show that the “viral” and “memetic” quality of a rumor prevail over the demonstrable credibility of a source and even the factuality of a reported event; the element of surprise or outrage in the heat of the moment is more powerful than the ironic detachment elicited by news satire and parody; and sharing motivations are definitely less concerned with perceived accuracy than with partisan support, community sentiment, emotional contagion, and a taste for the sensational or bizarre. © 2023 by the author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154591390"

We focus on the neglected phenomenon of racial hoaxes, which can be defined as misleading news stories dealing with health or safety threats, in which the protagonist is described in terms of ethnicity or nationality. The intervention procedure has been created starting from the well-established literature focused on media biases’ reflection, integrated with the recent studies on ‘mediated intergroup contact’ where the observation of the person belonging to the outgroup is crucial for prejudice reduction. The intervention involved 83 adolescents (Mage = 13.9; SDage = 0.9) and it was composed of two different parts, one focused on the analytical racial hoax reading, and the other focused on racial hoax rewriting after the ‘mediated contact’, represented by an alternative story given by the African protagonist. The results show that in dealing with misleading news, the promotion of this social-analytic processing reduces ethnic biases of moral disengagement. In particular, it was found that analytical processes are supported by the participants’ level of propensity for analytical reasoning and that these processes directly hinder distorted ethnic beliefs. Overall, these results suggest that improving social-analytic processes related to reflexivity could be an effective intervention to counter those distorted beliefs, such as ethnic disengagement beliefs, associated with discrimination and racial prejudice. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149414781"

In order to avoid potential harm to participants or society, it is imperative that we establish whether debriefing procedures remove any lasting influence of misinformation. In the current study, we followed up with 1547 participants one week after they had been exposed to fake news stories about COVID-19 and then provided with a detailed debriefing. False memories and beliefs for previously-seen fake stories declined from the original study, suggesting that the debrief was effective. Moreover, the debriefing resulted in reduced false memories and beliefs for novel fake stories, suggesting a broader impact on participants' willingness to accept misinformation. Small effects of misinformation on planned health behaviours observed in the original study were also eliminated at follow-up. Our findings suggest that when a careful and thorough debriefing procedure is followed, researchers can safely and ethically conduct misinformation research on sensitive topics.  © 2023 Greene, Murphy.

Based on a sample of 529 US and Canadian adults, two types of behaviors were assessed (i.e., vaccination status and subsequent booster willingness) using models based on two common COVID-19 conspiracy belief types (hoax and government).

This article investigates the perception that professional journalists have about the influence of these two phenomena -disinformation and hoaxes-, as well as content verification mechanisms -fact checking- in the performance of the journalistic profession and its future evolution. The procedure chosen for data collection consisted of 20 interviews with journalists who currently practice the profession in Spain, with the aim of offering us a panoramic view of the actions of journalism against disinformation and fake news, as well as what their relationship with the audience. The results show a positive and firm attitude of the profession to fight against false news, claiming its professionalism, valuing the verification of the contents and the role of trusted information sources, and a critical vision in which it is put the focus on the need for both the media and viewers to put more effort and interest in being well informed.

Nevertheless, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, about 120 nm in diameter, remains invisible to people whose cognition, emotions, and health-related behaviors are driven primarily by the subjective perception of the virus. Mass media communicating information, symbols, beliefs, and codes of conduct to the population contribute widely to the socially constructed representations of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, the aim of the current research is to investigate the impacts of the common COVID-19 mass media image of the ""ball with spikes""representing the SARS-CoV-2 virus on older adults particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease and fake news dissemination. This research is based on an innovative mixed-methods research design that combines questionnaires (N = 144), semi-structured research interviews, and pictographic measures (N = 26). The primary results demonstrate that individuals' perceptions of and emotional reactions to the invisible SARS-CoV-2 virus are shaped by mass media exposure, as the ""ball with spikes""became a familiar symbol of the COVID-19 virus, marked by the symbolism of dangerousness and mystery with a divisive aesthetic. The current research that aims to highlight the role of mass media as the vector of an icon image of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus provides additional elements that may contribute to improved crisis management effectiveness of future pandemic outbreaks.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150376599"

The ability of misinformation to spread through social media may worsen the harms of different emergencies, and fighting it is therefore critical. In this work, we analyzed the discussion of misinformation related to monkeypox on Twitter by training different classifiers that differentiate between tweets that spread and tweets that counter misinformation. We collected over 1.4M tweets related to the discussion of monkeypox on Twitter from over 500K users and calculated word and sentence embeddings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. We trained multiple machine learning classification models and fine-tuned a Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model on a set of 3K hand-labeled tweets. We found that the fine-tuned RoBERTa model provided superior results and used it to classify the complete dataset into three categories, namely misinformation, counter misinformation and neutral. We analyzed the behavioral patterns and domains that were used in misinformation and counter misinformation tweets. The findings provide insights into the scale of misinformation within the discussion on monkeypox and the behavior of tweets and users that spread and counter misinformation over time.

Given the relatively limited prevalence of misinformation in people’s news diets, this study explores if the heightened salience of misinformation as a persistent societal threat can have an unintended spillover effect by decreasing the credibility of factually accurate news. Using an experimental design (N = 1305), we test whether credibility ratings of factually accurate news are subject to exposure to misinformation, corrective information, misinformation warnings, and news media literacy (NML) interventions relativizing the misinformation threat. Findings suggest that efforts like warning about the threat of misinformation can prime general distrust in authentic news, hinting toward a deception bias in the context of fear of misinformation being salient. Next, the successfulness of NML interventions is not straight forward if it comes to avoiding that the salience of misinformation distorts people’s creditability accuracy. We conclude that the threats of the misinformation order may not just be remedied by fighting false information, but also by reestablishing trust in legitimate news. © 2023 The Author(s).

The pandemic of Covid-19 influenced the media organisations in their working processes significantly and a decrease in accuracy was one of the findings of our study. This paper examines the impact of the pandemic in local media to journalists’ practices and the role of the media. We aimed to research the effects of the pandemic in the local environment on journalistic procedures and the media's role after this period. In answering the research questions, we used the method of a structured questionnaire for journalists and semi-structured in-depth interviews for local News Editors. We aimed to research the media production practices on various levels of professionals included in local news. We detected those production practices that could endanger the credibility of the local media. The findings provided insights into how Slovenian local journalists and editors define, understand, and practice fact-checking. The results led to an understanding that the perception of the media role in offering information was higher during the pandemic period and that human verification is key in ensuring the credibility of content in local newsrooms. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study analyses young people’s perception of fake news based on a representative sample of residents in Spain aged between 15 and 24 (n=1,068). We consider the frequency they receive fake news, the topics they refer to, the sources, and how they deal with them. We considered how socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, location, political ideology or educational level influence how they receive fake news. Among other findings, the results show that the higher the age and educational level, the higher the rates of verification and recognition of fake news. In addition, individuals living in large municipalities and those on the right of the ideological spectrum verify information less frequently and use less reliable sources than other young people. © 2023, CEU Ediciones.

In the first part of the article, I will frame the problems of fake news and post‐truth within the dynamics characterizing the relationships between knowledge and power. Taking into account Foucault and Latour’s perspectives, I argue that the problem of fake news can be understood as a new kind of relationship between these two instances, previously stably coupled and in the hands of institutional power. Later, I will deal with three different meanings of “fake news,” that are usually blended and confused: (a) serendipity, (b) false belief, and (c) mendacity. Consequently, I will deal with the problem of “Semiological Guerrilla Warfare,” arguing that the new shape of the “knowledge‐power relationship” rendered alternative and non‐institutionally certified interpretations the norm. Eventually, I will identify the deep cause of this effect in the machinic production of documents provided by new technologies, causing a return of the medieval sense of “truth” as “trust,” independent from knowledge and strictly related to anecdotes and personal experiences. Finally, I will work on the concept of “truth” connected to technology, trying to reveal its genealogy with the aim of explaining some misleading contemporary beliefs on “post‐truth.”. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154037021"

If they are indeed related, we still know little about the underlying cognitive mechanisms that drive political learning when people rely on social media for news. Based on a two-wave panel survey collected during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we found that social media news use fosters the news-finds-me perception (particularly among those who feel overwhelmed with the volume of information available on social media).

While misinformation is not a new phenomenon, the COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated its spread through social media outlets, leading to widespread exposure to false or misleading information. This exposure can have serious consequences on individuals’ decision-making and behavior, especially when it comes to critical decisions related to education or healthcare. The use of social media as a source of information makes it essential to understand how people perceive and respond to misinformation to develop effective strategies for mitigating its harmful effects. Design/methodology/approach: This large-scale study explores the Omani individuals’ perceptions and behaviour of misinformation on the social Web in a series of studies that seek to enhance the authorities’ response to misinformation. The study adopted a quantitative approach to collect data. Using WhatsApp as a social networking platform, a survey was disseminated to capture participants’ perceptions and behaviour among different segments of citizens in Oman. Findings: The findings showed that Omani participants have high verification skills, implying high information literacy skills among them. Additionally, results indicated that misinformation had created doubt and anxiety among the participants. Moreover, it hindered many participants’ ability to take countermeasures and obtain reliable data. Originality/value: This study was a large-scale study conducted in Oman, making it one of a few studies conducted in the region about perceptions and behaviour towards misinformation. The findings help to understand how different cultures interacted with COVID-19 misinformation. In addition, these findings offer useful insight that can help health information professionals to design preventive resources that help people to obtain accurate information during crises. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150880927"

Drawing on a signal-detection framework, the current research investigated two distinct aspects of misinformation susceptibility: truth sensitivity, conceptualized as accurate discrimination between true and false information, and partisan bias, conceptualized as lower acceptance threshold for ideology-congruent information compared to ideology-incongruent information. Four preregistered experiments (n= 2,423) examined (a) truth sensitivity and partisan bias in veracity judgments and decisions to share information and (b) determinants and correlates of truth sensitivity and partisan bias in responses to misinformation. Although participants were able to distinguish between true and false information to a considerable extent, sharing decisions were largely unaffected by actual information veracity. A strong partisan bias emerged for both veracity judgments and sharing decisions, with partisan bias being unrelated to the overall degree of truth sensitivity. While truth sensitivity increased as a function of cognitive reflection during encoding, partisan bias increased as a function of subjective confidence. Truth sensitivity and partisan bias were both associated with misinformation susceptibility, but partisan bias was a stronger and more reliable predictor of misinformation susceptibility than truth sensitivity.

Especially populist politicians frequently use their social media platforms to target science and journalism, arguing these are part of an “evil elite,” deliberately misleading the public by spreading disinformation. While this type of discourse is highly concerning, thus far, we lack empirical evidence on how these accusations affect the public perceptions of scientists and journalists. To fill this gap, this study tests how politicians’ attacks affect citizens’ trust in journalists and scientists and the information provided by them. Furthermore, it investigates whether this discourse renders hostility towards journalists and scientists acceptable and whether there are effects on the image of politicians using such anti‐science rhetoric. Findings suggest that the effects of politicians’ attacks on citizens’ perceptions of scientists and journalists are limited. Only individuals with strong anti‐elitist attitudes are susceptible to disinformation accusations and indicate less belief in discred-ited scientific information. Interestingly, these individuals also perceive politicians using such attacks as more trustworthy and authentic. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152299625"

Given the current degree of proliferation of doctor–patient conflict news in China, this study aims to determine whether readers of doctor–patient news-initiated moral judgments prefer pain empathy for doctors or patients. Materials and methods: This study utilized localized doctor–patient news with high or low moral performance (based on morality ratings of patients’ behaviors) as moral-judgment-eliciting materials, and painful pictures as pain empathy-eliciting materials. The event-related potential (ERP) technique was utilized to assess moral judgment’s effect on the cognitive empathy component and to investigate electroencephalogram signals’ accuracy in classifying four brain response patterns when facing doctor or patient is experiencing or not experiencing pain. Results: Under low moral text material, participants exhibited smaller mean wave amplitude of positive 300 (P3) and late positive potential (LPP) to painful pictures than non-painful pictures when facing patients; under high moral text material, participants exhibited larger mean wave amplitude of P3 and LPP to painful pictures than non-painful pictures when facing doctors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals’ classification accuracy was significant in 0–1,000 ms in both high and low moral judgments, but the classification accuracy was higher in low moral judgments in some cognitive empathy stages (0.51, 0.53–0.55, 0.66–0.79, and 0.88–1 s). Conclusion: Under low moral judgment, individuals pay less attention to the patient’s (perpetrator’s) pain; under high moral judgment, individuals empathize with the doctor (the person praised), showing that news-induced moral judgment can sway readers’ empathy for different social groups. In cognitive empathy, individuals’ brain representations are more discriminatory under low than high moral judgments when confronted with pain by doctors and patients, which provides insight into objectively recognizing group bias.

Over the course of the pandemic, a debate has emerged about the appropriate democratic and technopolitical response when governments use disease surveillance technologies to tackle the spread of COVID-19, pointing out the dichotomy between state-Leviathan cybercontrol and civil liberties. The COVID-19 pandemic has inevitably raised the need to resiliently and technopolitically respond to democratic threats that hyperconnected and highly virialised societies produce. In order to shed light on this debate, amidst this volume on “democratic deepening”, this chapter introduces the new term “postpandemic technopolitical democracy” as a way to figure out emerging forms and scales for developing democracy and citizen participation in hyperconnected and highly virialised postpandemic societies. Insofar as the digital layer cannot be detached from the current democratic challenges of the twenty-first century including neoliberalism, scales, civic engagement, and action research-driven co-production methodologies; this chapter suggests a democratic toolbox encompassing four intertwined factors including (i) the context characterised by the algorithmic nations, (ii) challenges stemming from data sovereignty, (iii) mobilisation seen from the digital rights perspective, and (iv) grassroots innovation embodied through data cooperatives. This chapter elucidates that in the absence of coordinated and interdependent strategies to claim digital rights and data sovereignty by algorithmic nations, on the one hand, big tech data-opolies and, on the other hand, the GDPR led by the European Commission might bound (negatively) and expand (positively) respectively, algorithmic nations’ capacity to mitigate the negative side effects of the algorithmic disruption in Western democracies. © 2023, The Author(s).","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143230498"

A web-based experiment (N = 206) of adults living in the United States through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) was conducted for the measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine in March 2020. The results showed that the fact-checking label attached to the conspiratorial misinformation post significantly reduced MMR vaccine conspiracy beliefs compared to the no fact-checking (misinformation-only) condition but did not directly affect MMR misinformation engagement intentions and MMR vaccination intentions. In addition, we found that the fact-checking label effectively decreased vaccine conspiracy beliefs and misinformation engagement intentions for those whose prior favorable attitudes toward MMR vaccination were relatively low. Based on our findings, we suggest that public health professionals and health communicators use the fact-checking label as a promising tool for countering conspiracy theories about vaccination. However, they should further seek alternative ways to limit the public’s engagement in misinformation-related activities on social media and promote health protective behavioral intentions, given the limited effects of fact-checking labels. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124107563"

People with congruent prior attitudes are more likely to perceive misinformation as credible and agree with its positions than people with incongruent prior attitudes. We further show that although fact-checkers can lower the perceived credibility of misinformation on both runners and migrants, corrective messages do not affect attitudes toward migrants.

As a contribution, this study aims to link individuals’ biased perceptions of self-other asymmetry—i.e., optimistic bias in risk assessment and third-person perception regarding undesired media influence—to different patterns of news consumption and misinformation perceptions. To study these phenomena, we distributed an online survey in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic among citizens from the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany (N = 1,912). The findings offer consistent support for bias beliefs: Compared to others, citizens from all four countries perceived themselves as less vulnerable to health and financial risk—i.e., optimistic bias—as well as the influence of misinformation—i.e., third-person perception. In a next step, we provide novel insights into how general news use can be associated with lower optimistic bias regarding perceived personal risk, while intentional exposure to issue-specific information and misinformation perceptions can relate to higher optimistic bias and third-person perceptions. These relationships were found to differ across individual countries. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how media use and perceptions relate to perceived invulnerability to potential harm, which, in turn, might impede pro-social intentions during crises surrounded by the omnipresence of misinformation. © 2022 The Author(s).

This finding, known as retrieval-enhanced suggestibility (RES), can be eliminated when participants are warned about possible inaccuracies in the misinformation source (Thomas et al., 2010). In three experiments, we investigated whether this warning benefit persists across delays. When the warning was issued shortly after participants were exposed to misinformation, it inoculated participant witnesses against RES, regardless of whether the final memory test occurred immediately or 48 hr after the warning. However, the warning lost its effectiveness when it was delivered 48 hr after participants were exposed to misinformation. These results applied to both recognition memory and the confidence-accuracy relationship. We considered these data from the perspective of temporal distinctiveness, and we argue that a warning serves a similar function to a forget cue in the directed forgetting paradigm.

Method. Online questionnaire completed by 26 teens, ages 15 to 19 years, living in Brooklyn, New York, in June 2020. Responses include quantitative data (ranking and checklists) and qualitative data (free writing). Analysis. The questionnaire explored information themes in relation to COVID-19, such as information sources and platforms, credibility and disinformation, teens’ roles in information intermediation, affective aspects of their information behaviour, as well as what would have helped teens find COVID-19 information. Results. Teens experienced anxiety as they looked for reliable information about COVID-19. They served as their family’s language brokers and technology experts, taking on the responsibilities of information intermediator. Teens used social media platforms and legacy media as information sources. Nevertheless, teens indicated a wish for institutional support and guidance from governments (municipal, state, federal) and schools. Libraries were not an information source. Conclusions. The results of this study have implications for research into teen mental health in relation to the COVID-19 global pandemic, as well as reframing the meaning of ‘everyday life information seeking’ during a time of crisis, when everyday life is not normal. © 2022, University of Boras.

This investigation determined how perceptions about COVID-19 science and sociocultural membership associate with 557 university biology students’: (1) COVID-19 behaviors after stay-at-home orders and (2) support for future societal COVID-19 responses. Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses demonstrate that students’ COVID-19 mitigating actions after stay-at-home orders were significantly and positively associated with, in order of importance: (1) higher levels of COVID-19 spread prevention knowledge; (2) espousing more liberal, as opposed to conservative, political orientations; (3) being female; and (4) increased disbelief of COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation claims. Furthermore, the students’ political orientation moderated the relationship between their trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decisions and their personal COVID-19 actions, with trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making being a significant positive predictor of moderate, conservative, and very conservative student groups’ COVID-19 mitigating actions. Conversely, there was no association between trust in scientific models to guide COVID-19 decision-making and very liberal and liberal students’ conducting COVID-19 actions. Hierarchical moderated multiple regression analyses revealed that students’ support for societal-wide COVID-19 mitigating measures going forward is positively associated with, in order of importance: (1) espousing more liberal, as opposed to conservative, political orientations; (2) higher levels of COVID-19 spread prevention knowledge; (3) increased disbelief of COVID-19 misinformation/disinformation claims; (4) trust in scientific models for guiding COVID-19 decision-making; and (5) beliefs that factors beyond science and technology (e.g., personal actions) are necessary for pandemic resolution. Implications discussed include the importance for helping students analyze how sociocultural membership, personal biases, and trust in science interactively influence socioscientific decision-making. Further recommendations discussed include how science communication strategies must account for sociocultural variance in order to optimize trust in science and reasoned and responsible action. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122692961"

A recently proposed strategy to help online users recognise false content is to follow the techniques of professional fact checkers, such as looking for information on other websites (lateral reading) and looking beyond the first results suggested by search engines (click restraint). In two preregistered online experiments (N = 5387), we simulated a social media environment and tested two interventions, one in the form of a pop-up meant to advise participants to follow such techniques, the other based on monetary incentives. We measured participants’ ability to identify whether information was scientifically valid or invalid. Analysis of participants’ search style reveals that both monetary incentives and pop-up increased the use of fact-checking strategies. Monetary incentives were overall effective in increasing accuracy, whereas the pop-up worked when the source of information was unknown. Pop-up and incentives, when used together, produced a cumulative effect on accuracy. We suggest that monetary incentives enhance content relevance, and could be combined with fact-checking techniques to counteract disinformation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127626013"

This paper investigates how social media can become an effective channel to promote engagement and (re)build trust. To measure the social response to quality communication, we conducted an experimental study to test a set of science communication recommendations on Facebook and Twitter. The experiment involved communication practitioners and social media managers from select countries in Europe, applying and testing such recommendations for five months. Here we analyse their feedback in terms of adoption and show that some differences emerge across platforms, topics, and recommendation categories. To evaluate these recommendations’ effect on users, we measure their response to quality content, finding that the median engagement is generally higher, especially on Twitter. The results indicate that quality communication strategies may elicit positive feedback on social media. A data-driven and co-designed approach in developing counter-strategies is thus promising in tackling misinformation.

This paper provides evidence that affective polarization impacts misinformation belief, arguing that citizens with higher levels of affective polarization are more likely to believe in-party-congruent misinformation and less likely to believe out-party-congruent misinformation. The argument is supported by data from the ANES 2020 Social Media Study and the ANES 2020 Time Series Study, which speaks to the generalizability of the relationship. Additionally, a survey experiment provides evidence that the relationship is causal. The results hold among Democrats and Republicans and are independent of the effects of partisan strength and ideological extremity. Furthermore, the relationship between affective polarization and misinformation belief is exacerbated by political sophistication rather than tempered by it, implying that education will not solve the issue.

This study contributes to that line of work by investigating how reliance on multiple digital media may help support or suppress misinformation belief, and how individual differences in misinformation susceptibility condition this process. Alternative health outlets (AH media), advocating home/homeopathic remedies over conventional medicine can be important sources of misinformation, yet are largely ignored previously. In this study, we first test how reliance on different platforms predicts health misinformation belief. Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model, we further investigate how need for cognition (NFC) and faith in intuition (FI) moderate the relationship between news reliance and susceptibility to misinformation. We conducted a survey in Singapore, Turkey, and the U.S (N = 3,664) to measure how these proposed relationships explain misinformed beliefs about vaccines, genetically modified foods and alternative medicine. We found reliance on online legacy news was negatively associated with the likelihood of believing health misinformation, while the reverse was true for social media and AH media. Additionally, those with both greater NFC and FI were more susceptible to health misinformation when they relied on social media and AH media more. In contrast, neither NFC nor FI moderated the relationship between reliance on online legacy news and health misinformation belief.

Journalists were challenged to report on an outbreak of pressing health-related information, complicated by malinformation erupting in a time of enhanced public demand for reliable facts. This study uses in-depth interviews with journalists at leading news outlets- both public service and commercial, in Italy, Spain, and Bulgaria (N = 24) to examine how they responded to misinformation and disinformation arising in the initial months of the pandemic. Using the frameworks of journalistic epistemology and the hierarchy-of-influences model, we explored the norms, routines, and practices guiding journalists’ truth claims as well as the individual, routine, organizational, and social-systems influences shaping their decision-making. We found three common narratives of conspiracy theories consistent across different media systems: “big state” concerns, evident in people questioning the very existence of the coronavirus as a pretense for globally enforced state supervision on individual freedoms; “big pharma,” or people blaming the lack of a cure for COVID-19 on pharmaceutical companies pushing for vaccinations; and “big fear” attitude - falsehoods about vaccines potentially causing more harm than good, including changing people’s DNA. We also discuss three common strategies journalists used to respond to COVID-misinformation: deflecting, countering and false equivalency approach. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144235741"

For example, people tend to recall more events that support than oppose their current worldview. The present study examined partisan bias in memory for events related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot in the United States. Participants rated their memory for true and false events that were either favourable to their political party or the other major political party in the United States. For both true and false events, participants remembered more events that favoured their political party. Regression analyses showed that the number of false memories that participants reported was positively associated with their tendency to support conspiracy beliefs and with their self-reported engagement with the Capitol riot. These results suggest that Democrats and Republicans remember the Capitol Riot differently and that certain individual difference factors can predict the formation of false memories in this context. Misinformation played an influential role in the Capitol riot and understanding differences in memory for this event is beneficial to avoiding similar tragedies in the future. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141065548"

Still, we are only beginning to understand how this development affects people’s perceptions of consumed news stories. The article reports on an experiment designed to investigate the effect the distribution of a news story in social media (Facebook) has on news message credibility. A control group was exposed to a news story on an original news website, and treatment groups were exposed to the same news story shared on Facebook. Results demonstrate that distribution via Facebook affects the credibility of the news story. The effect is strongest when politicians are intermediary-senders, and to some extent depend on the party affiliation of intermediary-sender and the social media audience. In the context of fake news, the results are reassuring: people are less trustful of news they consume through social media. However, the results also suggest that social media news sharing can contribute to the long-term decrease in trust in news. © 2021 The Author(s).

Specifically, it examines the extent to which variables such as age and education determine the conviction that one is able to spot false content, and influence the skills and habits of checking and sharing potentially unverified information on health, a serious problem in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on two face-to-face focus groups and one online focus group made up of Spanish people between the ages of 25 and 54, this qualitative research study explored the behaviour of regular citizens when assessing the truthfulness of health-related news, and their habits about believing it. The results reveal that younger people tended to distrust the ability of older people to spot false content, and vice versa.

In order to achieve efficient communication, it is necessary to plan the material in a way that reaches levels of semiotic pertinence, which privilege the perception of meaning and enable holistic knowledge about the recipients’ culture, as in “Human-Centered Design” (HCD). In this context, this paper presents the case study on the development of the EU4ALL project, co-founded by the EP, which is being developed by a Portuguese cooperative and aims to create strategies to communicate the 10 democratic values highlighted by the European Parliament, in a way that is more accessible to communities in situations of information vulnerability, specifically to people serving time in prison and living in social housing. For this, the Double Diamond design model was used, involving a literature review about democratic values, research synthesis, validation sessions with Portuguese Euro Deputies (MEPs), creation of communication materials, testing with users and finally the delivery of the materials and realization of sensitization sessions with vulnerable groups. Therefore, it was possible to verify the validity of the approaches used, which explored the levels of semiotic pertinence, establishing strategic and efficient communication. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140994856"

It aims at accounting for pragmalinguistic and discursive strategies in use in disseminating medical content in early modern and contemporary times in and beyond expert discourse communities. It departs from the on- going analysis of sections of (i) Rodrigo de Castro's (1617) original treatise on gynaecology under translation process into Portuguese and English (cf. Gynecia research project 2019- 2022), originally written in the language of communication in science and medicine in the early modern period, that is Latin; (ii) along with corpora in Portuguese collected by Nunes (2020) of (pseudo)medicinal and (pseudo)scientific content, retrieved from publications available on the websites Vamos Lá Portugal and Lusojornal2015. These are labelled as producers of fake news by other Portuguese print dailies, such as Diário de Notícias (cf. Pena, 2018). A contrastive, exploratory, and cross- period analysis is undertaken, supported by a corpusbased approach. The analysis comprises narrative sequences in treatises (Labov, 1997) and testimonial passages (Maingueneau, 2004), of which Castro's treatise offers but some evidence on first- and third- person reference, which are reported to contribute to some of the communicative features (Sousa, 2019) to bridge the gap between the ""doctor- patient communication dyad, its functions in the healing process"" (Boguslawska- Tafelska, 2020). This stance has been particularly contended from a holistic and ecolinguistic perspective (Charon, 2005) with renewed relevance in the production and dissemination of medical content (Boguslawska- Tafelska, 2019) as part of authors'/ speakers' persuasive and emotional involvement with health issues for centuries. In other words, popular science, experiential knowledge, popular beliefs, and traditions seem to be interwoven unevenly with sound scientific medical content (Sousa, 2019). There is evidence of a shifting pronoun reference, i.e., a plurality of voices (Sousa & Correia, 2014): the citizen/ layperson, the learned person, and the researcher/ expert in the field. The underlying persuasive force between story and discourse (Culler, 1981) which reinforces the reliability of the corpora of the so- called fake news is linked to testimony (also explicit in Castro's treatise), to emotion (pathos), followed by the reference to sound scholars'/ researchers' statements (ethos), all of which intended to involve the audience, for instance via proximization strategies (Kopytowska, 2013, 2018, 2020). © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2022.

Using Moral Foundations Theory, this study compared the moral narratives underlying polarized views about e-cigarette use and regulation. We integrated computational and human strategies by conducting the Chow test on the time series data and classification, topic modeling, and Chi-square tests on posts (N = 2,669) from 26 pro-vaping and 19 anti-vaping Facebook Pages. The observation period (August 1, 2019 to March 5, 2020) encompassed the outbreak of “e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury” (EVALI), deaths and subsequent legislation. Results revealed that pro-vaping posts were more likely than anti-vaping posts to mention Fairness/cheating and Authority/subversion, involving a conspiracy belief in an “e-cigarettes vs. Big Tobacco” rivalry, while anti-vaping posts were more likely to mention Sanctity/degradation. There were no significant differences between pro-vaping and anti-vaping posts in the likelihood of mentioning Care/harm or Loyalty/betrayal. Nevertheless, according to the topic modeling results, the use of moral foundations varied between pro-vaping and anti-vaping narratives, with the meanings of Care/harm and Loyalty/betrayal dependent on the post author’s group affiliation. Health interventions can tailor persuasive messages to different moral values and debunk misinformation about public health policies to mitigate the vaping epidemic.

To answer that question, we reinterviewed members of a national US panel that we had previously surveyed beginning in 2018. As hypothesized, having a conspiratorial mindset in 2019 predicted COVID-vaccination hesitancy in 2021 better than prior trust in health authorities or acceptance of vaccine misinformation. Those with the mindset were also more likely to consume media that bolstered belief in pandemic conspiracies. Research is needed on the determinants of conspiratorial mindset and ways to minimize the likelihood that consequential health decisions will be influenced by it. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141218889"

An online platform called RealEye allowed participants to engage in the eye-tracking study from their personal computer webcams, allowing for higher ecological validity and a closer replication of social media interaction. Methods: The study consisted of two parts with a total of five visuals of social media posts mimicking news posts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Participants were asked to view examples of real and fake news taken from a news fact-checking website, Snopes, and their eye movements were recorded during the process. Participants were recruited through Prolific and SONA; the total sample size for study 1.1 was 29 participants, and the total for study 1.2 was 25 participants, after removing poor eye-tracking data. A total of five visual images comprising true and false news were shown to the participant, study 1.1 had three examples and study 1.2 had two examples. There were two main cultural backgrounds in focus: participants born in China or the United Kingdom. Results: Results suggested that participants follow a similar visual pattern of attention to Areas of Interest (AOIs) on the posts, which leads us to believe that due to the global standardisation of popular social media platforms, a bias might have occurred during information discernment. Discussion: It is suggested that regardless of country background, users may have similar eye-tracking results while viewing a social media post because social media platform formats are standardised globally. Further research would recommend looking at language and linguistic traits when seeking differences between country backgrounds during online information discernment.

Using a conjoint experiment, we randomly assigned participants (N = 1,489) to receive an experimentally manipulated message describing an allegation of political misconduct. Results suggest that partisan cues play a significant role in influencing both belief and perceived credibility.

According to WHO, HL is pivotal in fighting infodemic effectively, and education is a vital tool for developing it. In the presented work, we analyze 247 educational materials dedicated to children, adolescents, and their carers explaining the pandemic, prepared by the Chinese, American, German, Italian and Polish governments and international non-governmental organizations. Focusing on the textual and visual side of the documents, we investigated how the pandemic is explained and what discursive measures were used to inform young citizens about the risks and consequences of pandemic restrictions. Additionally, we verified whether the materials helped developing critical thinking, which is crucial to prevent spreading fake news and conspiracy theories. Although the analyzed materials were prepared in different cultural contexts, we identified that all of them contained simple instructions on the desired behaviours during the pandemic. Key messages relating to the importance of hygienic behaviors were often supplemented with guidelines on how to successfully complete each action. While the cultural particularities in presenting the state of the pandemic are visible, the challenges of dealing with the emotional and social crises were dominant all around the world. In our study, we argue that the possibilities of building HL were not fully exploited by the national and international institutions. Citizens were taught how to behave in unusual circumstances but not why they should behave differently. The educational materials lacked reliable knowledge that would allow them to deal with infodemic and develop critical thinking. We conclude that health education expertise worldwide should be focused on enhancing individuals’ ability to make informed health decisions and provide three recommendations regarding the process of development of health educational resources for children and the youth. © 2022 Świątkiewicz-Mośny et al.

The uncontrollable spread of dubious information has been dubbed an infode-mic and is facilitated by social media and the internet. The belief in, and diffusion of conspiracy theories is linked to various factors familiar to the psychological and criminological fields. Key among these factors is a trait known as conspiratorial thinking. In order to combat this pheno-menon, it is essential that we understand how and why conspiracy theories spread and what makes people prone to believing in them. This literature review aims to highlight the principal research into the identifying characteristics of conspiracy theories, as well as the psycho-social and criminological factors that sustain them. It also explores the effects that conspiracy belief can have on people and groups. It then delves into the role of social media in the diffusion of conspiracy theories during the pandemic. Finally, it illustrates the main strategies that have been used to counter misinformation and conspiracy theories and suggests some areas where further research is required. © 2022 Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144073751"

Despite their higher risk of infection and sub-optimal access to healthcare, Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy focused primarily on age, as well as medical and occupational risk factors. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods constant comparative qualitative analysis of epidemiological data from a national database of COVID-19 cases and vaccine coverage in four Canadian jurisdictions. Jurisdictional policies, policy updates, and associated press releases were collected from government websites, and qualitative data were collected through 34 semi-structured interviews of key informants from nine Canadian jurisdictions. Interviews were coded and analyzed for themes and patterns. Results COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out in Canada in three phases, each accompanied by specific challenges. Vaccine delivery systems typically featured large-venue mass immunization sites that presented a variety of barriers for those from vulnerable communities. The engagement and targeted outreach that featured in the later phases were driven predominantly by the efforts of community organizations and primary care providers, with limited support from provincial governments. Conclusions While COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Canada is largely considered a success, such an interpretation is shaped by the metrics chosen. Vaccine delivery systems across Canada need substantial improvements to ensure optimal uptake and equitable access for all. Our findings suggest a more equitable model for vaccine delivery featuring early establishment of local barrier-free clinics, culturally safe and representative environment, as well as multi-lingual assistance, among other vulnerability-sensitive elements. © 2022 Kholina et al.

In addition to the obvious health, economic and political effects, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered immense changes in the social spheres. People and institutions were forced to adjust to the new circumstances, change habits and move most or all of their activity online. In the completely virtual world, pandemic became a fertile ground for the bloom of the conspiracy theories already existing, but struggling for the global attention. The aim of the paper is to present three main conspiracy theories rapidly gaining popularity during the pandemic (the QAnon, anti-vaccination movements and anti-5G movements) and to analyse how they developed since the pandemic had been announced. In particular, the rising activity of the representatives of the movements will be analysed, as well as its acceleration in connection with pandemic and the resulting influence on social and political life. Finally, the paper will try examine whether the rapid development of conspiracy theories within societies has had any relations to the level of trust towards government-made decisions. The thesis being verified hereto is that pandemic accelerated the development of conspiracy theories due to the diminishing level of trust towards governments operating in the most difficult period in recent history. There are variety of reasons for the belief in conspiracy theories and they depend on the specificity of the theory and specificity of group of people it originates from. In general, it can be noted that all kind of conspiracies are developed by either (1) people who actually believe in them and are sharing them with good intentions (to warn other about the dangers hidden behind certain actions or institutions) or (2) malignant individuals whose aim is to discord or discredit an opponent or critic or, alternatively, distract attention from misconduct or lack of competence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133298891"

To fill this void, this study explores this relationship while distinguishing between knowledge related to uncontested issues and knowledge related to issues that have been subject to public controversies (climate change, vaccination, genetically modified organisms, crime, and immigration). Relying on a large-scale survey among Swedish citizens conducted in 2020 (N = 2,160), we find that the relationship with patterns of news use is substantially different across these types of beliefs. Among other things, the results suggest that knowledge of uncontested issue domains is positively related to news use, but knowledge of contested issue domains is not. The intentional avoidance of news is only negatively related to knowledge of contested issues. Taken together, the results suggest that the mechanisms driving beliefs related to uncontested versus contested issues are substantially different. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110010529"

We test the relationship between perceived prevalence of misinformation and people’s worries about COVID-19. In Study 1, analyses of a survey across 17 countries indicate a positive association: perceptions of high prevalence of misinformation are correlated with high worries about COVID-19. However, the relationship is weaker in countries with higher levels of case-fatality ratios, and independent from the actual amount of misinformation per country. Study 2 replicates the relationship using experimental data. Furthermore, Study 2 demonstrates the underlying mechanism, that is, perceived prevalence of misinformation fosters the belief that COVID-19 is spiralling out of control, which in turn, increases worries.

However, this change is rarely sustained over time, with belief returning towards pre-correction levels. This is called belief regression. The current study aimed to examine the association between memory for the correction and belief regression, and whether corrected misinformation suffers from belief regression more than affirmed facts. Participants from Prolific Academic (N = 612) rated the veracity of 16 misinformation and 16 factual items and were randomly assigned to a correction condition or test-retest control. Immediately after misinformation was corrected and facts affirmed, participants re-rated their belief and were asked whether they could remember the items' presented veracity. Participants repeated this post-test one month later. We found that belief and memory were highly associated, both immediately (⍴ = 0.51), and after one month (⍴ = 0.82), and that memory explained 66% of the variance in belief regression after correcting for measurement reliability. We found the rate of dissenting (accurately remembering that misinformation was presented as false but still believing it) remained stable between the immediate and delayed post-test, while the rate of forgetting quadrupled. After one month, 57% of participants who believed in the misinformation thought that the items were presented to them as true. Belief regression was more pronounced for misinformation than facts, but this was greatly attenuated once pre-test belief was equated. Together, these results clearly indicate that memory plays a fundamental role in belief regression, and that repeated corrections could be an effective method to counteract this phenomenon. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138485823"

These correlational findings are often interpreted as evidence that beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation are exogenous factors that shape human behavior, such as forgoing vaccination. This interpretation has motivated researchers to develop methods for “prebunking,” “debunking,” or otherwise limiting the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation online. However, the robust literatures on conspiracy theory beliefs, health behaviors, and media effects lead us to question whether beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation should be treated as exogenous to vaccine hesitancy and refusal. Employing U.S. survey data (n = 2,065) from July 2021, we show that beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation are not only related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal, but also strongly associated with the same psychological, social, and political motivations theorized to drive COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and refusal. These findings suggest that beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation might not always be an exogenous cause, but rather a manifestation of the same factors that lead to vaccine hesitancy and refusal.

Sharing constitutes a distinctive communicative act, governed by a dedicated norm and motivated to a large extent by social identity maintenance. But confusion about this norm and its lack of inherent epistemic checks lead readers to misunderstand posts, attribute excess or insufficient credibility to posts, and allow posters to evade epistemic accountability—all contributing to the spread of epistemically toxic content online. This spread can be effectively addressed if (1) people and platforms add significantly more context to shared posts and (2) platforms nudge people to develop and follow recognized epistemic norms of posting and sharing. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159780566"

Nevertheless, little is known about the actual effects of fake news on behavioural intentions. Does exposure to or belief in misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines affect people’s intentions to receive such a vaccine? This paper attempts to address this question via three preregistered experiments (N = 3463). In Study 1, participants (n = 1269) were exposed to fabricated pro- or anti-vaccine information or to neutral true information, and then asked about their intentions to get vaccinated. In Study 2, participants (n = 646) were exposed to true pro- and anti-vaccine information, while Study 3 (n = 1548) experimentally manipulated beliefs in novel misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines by increasing exposure to the information. The results of these three studies showed that exposure to false information about the vaccines had little effect on participants’ intentions to get vaccinated, even when multiple exposures led them to believe the headlines to be more accurate. An exploratory meta-analysis of studies 1 and 3, with a combined sample size of 2683, showed that exposure to false information both supporting and opposing COVID-19 vaccines actually increased vaccination intentions, though the effect size was very small. We conclude by cautioning researchers against equating exposure to misinformation or perceived accuracy of false news with actual behaviours. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139109762"

Here we investigate the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy are associated with levels of online misinformation about vaccines. We also look for evidence of directionality from online misinformation to vaccine hesitancy. We find a negative relationship between misinformation and vaccination uptake rates. Online misinformation is also correlated with vaccine hesitancy rates taken from survey data. Associations between vaccine outcomes and misinformation remain significant when accounting for political as well as demographic and socioeconomic factors. While vaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with Republican vote share, we observe that the effect of online misinformation on hesitancy is strongest across Democratic rather than Republican counties.

From global warming to the spread of misinformation and beyond, our species is facing several major challenges that are the result of the limits of our own reasoning and decision-making. So, why are we so prone to errors during reasoning? In this chapter, I will outline a framework for understanding reasoning errors that is based on a three-stage dual-process model of analytic engagement (intuition, metacognition, and reason). The model has two key implications: (1) That a mere lack of deliberation and analytic thinking is a primary source of errors and (2) That when deliberation is activated, it generally reduces errors (via questioning intuitions and integrating new information) and rarely increases errors (via rationalization and motivated reasoning). In support of these claims, I review research showing the extensive predictive validity of measures that index individual differences in analytic cognitive style—even beyond explicit errors per se. In particular, analytic thinking is not only predictive of skepticism about a wide range of epistemically suspect beliefs (paranormal, conspiratorial, COVID-19 misperceptions, pseudoscience and alternative medicines) as well as decreased susceptibility to bullshit, fake news, and misinformation, but also important differences in people's moral judgments and values as well as their religious beliefs (and disbeliefs). Furthermore, in some (but not all cases), there is evidence from experimental paradigms that support a causal role of analytic thinking in determining judgments, beliefs, and behaviors. The findings reviewed here provide some reason for optimism for the future: It may be possible to foster analytic thinking and therefore improve the quality of our decisions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145285052"

Such an exposure to misleading information might lead to false memory creation. We examined whether people can form false memories for COVID-19-related fake news. Furthermore, we investigated which individual factors might predict false memory formation for fake news. In two experiments, we provided participants with two pieces of COVID-19-related fake news along with a non-probative photograph. In Experiment 1, 41% (n = 66/161) of our sample reported at least one false memory for COVID-19-related fake news. In Experiment 2, even a higher percentage emerged (54.9%; n = 185/337). Moreover, in Experiment 2, participants with conspiracy beliefs were more likely to report false memories for fake news than those without such beliefs, irrespective of the conspiratorial nature of the materials. Finally, while well-being was found to be positively associated with both true and false memories (Experiment 1), only analytical thinking was negatively linked to the vulnerability to form false memories for COVID-19-related fake news (Experiment 2). Overall, our data demonstrated that false memories can occur following exposure to fake news about COVID-19, and that governmental and social media interventions are needed to increase individuals’ discriminability between true and false COVID-19-related news.

Sentiment-encoded social media indicators have been poorly developed for expressed text to forecast healthcare pressure and infer population risk-perception patterns. Here we introduce Infodemic Tomography (InTo) as the first web-based interactive infoveillance cybertechnology that forecasts and visualizes spatio-temporal sentiments and healthcare pressure as a function of social media positivity (i.e., Twitter here), considering both epidemic information and potential misinformation. Information spread is measured on volume and retweets, and the Value of Misinformation (VoMi) is introduced as the impact on forecast accuracy where misinformation has the highest dissimilarity in information dynamics. We validated InTo for COVID-19 in New Delhi and Mumbai by inferring distinct socio-epidemiological risk-perception patterns. We forecast weekly hospitalization and cases using ARIMA models and interpolate spatial hospitalization using geostatistical kriging on inferred risk perception curves between tweet positivity and epidemiological outcomes. Geospatial tweet positivity tracks accurately ∼ 60% of hospitalizations and forecasts hospitalization risk hotspots along risk aversion gradients. VoMi is higher for risk-prone areas and time periods, where misinformation has the highest non-linear predictability, with high incidence and positivity manifesting popularity-seeking social dynamics. Hospitalization gradients, VoMi, effective healthcare pressure and spatial model-data gaps can be used to predict hospitalization fluxes, misinformation, healthcare capacity gaps and surveillance uncertainty. Thus, InTo is a participatory instrument to better prepare and respond to public health crises by extracting and combining salient epidemiological and social surveillance at any desired space-time scale. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127727046"

The current study is specially designed to analyze the perceptions of Pakistani journalists regarding the credibility of social media as a news source. This study helps the researcher to ascertain whether social media is a credible source of information among Pakistani journalists or not. To investigate the proposed hypothesis, the researcher opted for a cross-sectional survey method (n=196) by using the questionnaire technique. The sample of this study is both male and female journalists from print and electronic media of Lahore. The results claim that journalists are using social media for news updates, sharing breaking news and depending on it for their professional needs. Study also identifies a significant association between the usage of social media and the perceptions of its credibility; if journalists are spending more time on a site then they are more likely to identify fake and fabricated news. The present study also contributes to the body of knowledge in the area of social media credibility and journalists’ perception in Pakistan.

Preservice teachers, both so-called digital natives at the cutting edge of the social web and tomorrow’s educators, represent a useful object of study. The purpose of this paper is to describe preservice teachers’ critical thinking skills scores notably regarding environmental factors (training type, country of study and employment) and personal determinants (metaliteracy self-efficacy and belief in the likelihood to become a teacher) in three French-speaking nations (Wallonia, France and Quebec). Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative methodology, this article is part of sequential mixed design research aiming to describe the level of preservice teachers’ (n = 245) critical thinking in three French-speaking nations: Wallonia, France and Quebec. This study aimed to see to what extent critical thinking skills (measured with a translated version of the Halpern Critical Thinking Assessment; Halpern, 2016) can notably be influenced by metaliteracy self-efficacy (MASE). Metaliteracy is a concept that aims to join information, digital and media literacy providing a comprehensive framework “for engaging with individuals and ideas in digital environments” (Mackey and Jacobson, 2011, p. 70). Findings: This study establishes the influence of individual determinants such as the feelings of self-efficacy in metaliteracy as well as the belief in the likelihood of becoming a teacher. This study proposes a model predicting the critical thinking skills based on self-efficacy in critical thinking and metaliteracy, the type of training and the interaction between employment and the country of study. Originality/value: Considering contemporary information issues and infodemic phenomena, critical thinking skills should be developed among preservice teachers. There is a significant positive correlation between MASE and critical thinking skills. Pre-service teachers’ country of study, as well as their training trajectory, seems to influence their critical thinking skills. Involvement in professional life also appears to promote critical thinking skills. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124341441"

However, the role of social factors on people’s reliance on corrected misinformation has received little attention. In two experiments, we investigated the extent to which social endorsement of misinformation and corrections influences belief updating. In both experiments misinformation and fact-checks were presented as social media posts, and social endorsement was manipulated via the number of “likes.” In Experiment 1, social endorsement of the initial misinformation had a significant influence on belief; participants believed misinformation with high social endorsement more than misinformation with low endorsement. This effect was observed pre-factcheck and post-fact-check. High social endorsement of the fact-checks was associated with reduced misinformation belief; however, evidence for the persistence of this effect was mixed. These findings were replicated in Experiment 2. Our findings indicate that social endorsement can moderate our beliefs in misinformation and the fact-checks designed to correct these beliefs. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145821847"

We consider how social media data have been used in firearms research to date and how they can be best used moving forward. Despite the many advantages of using social media data, there are key analytical and ethical considerations associated with their use, including understanding the underlying population, constructing valid and reliable measures from shared content, the possibility of false data and misinformation through fake accounts, and concerns having to do with the privacy and consent of social media users.

This polarization may arise from the way in which the attitudes of each side is echoed back to them, especially on social media. In this paper, I argue that echo chambers are not to blame for this polarization, even if they are causally responsible for it. They are not to blame, because belief calibration in an echo chamber is a rational process; moreover, the epistemically constitutive properties of echo chambers are not optional for epistemically social animals like us. There is no special problem of echo chambers; rather, there is a problem of misleading evidence (especially higher-order evidence). Accordingly, we ought to respond to misinformation about COVID neither by attempting to dismantle echo chambers nor by attempting to make people more rational, but rather by attempting to supplant unreliable higher-order evidence with better evidence. © 2021 The Author(s).

This article brings together literature on trust in journalism, political esthetics, and pragmatist semiotics to analyze how fake news outlets seek to achieve trust. We conduct a visual analysis of both mainstream and “fake” news websites, identifying how “fake” news websites employ specific design elements in patterned ways that simultaneously (1) establish themselves as legitimate claimants to the label of “news outlet” and (2) differentiate themselves as outlets that can be depended upon to provide a certain class of political information that falls outside the mainstream. We argue that the news website is best understood as a design genre, within which there can be variations in design style. Fake news outlets must conform to the genre expectations of news websites. Beyond this, fake news websites must also employ design elements in ways that convey political ideology through style. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131890489"

If so, what are the criteria how relevant are they in our personal and political culture today? The really important matters in politics and governance necessitate a confidence that our beliefs will lead dependably to predictable and verifiable outcomes. Accordingly, it is unethical to hold a belief that is founded on insufficient evidence or based on hearsay or blind acceptance. In this paper, we demonstrate that the pragmatist concept of truth best meets this standard for ethically held belief in matters of politics and governance. Currently, these standards are abused by the gaslighting and distortion characteristics of the often social media driven ‘misinformation society’.

However, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the strength of the relationship and whether the negative relationship exists in both directions (reciprocal effects). One explanation of the heterogeneity pertains to the fact that the time interval between consecutive measurement occasions varies (e.g., 1 month, 3 months) both between and within studies. Therefore, a continuous time meta-analysis based on longitudinal studies was conducted. This approach enables one to examine how the strength of the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 preventive behavior depends on the time interval. In total, 1035 correlations were coded for 17 samples (N = 16,350). The results for both the full set of studies and a subset consisting of 13 studies corroborated the existence of reciprocal effects. Furthermore, there was some evidence of publication bias. The largest cross-lagged effects were observed between 3 and 6 months, which can inform decision-makers and researchers when carrying out interventions or designing studies examining the consequences of new conspiracy theories. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133566782"

More specifically, the study compares Swiss and UK media markets and analyses Swiss and UK press councils’ rulings between 2000 and 2019 that upheld complaints about accuracy norm violations in political journalism. The findings show that broadsheets increasingly violate the accuracy norm the closer election campaigns approach to election dates. They thereby drive other news media in a media market to increasingly violate the accuracy norm as well. However, this holds only for the UK media market but not for the Swiss media market.

This study examines how experiences of EVD infection, and preventive measures such as social distancing, were linked to experiences of stigma and social exclusion among those reintegrating into their communities. Methods Key informant interviews (n = 42) and focus group discussions (n = 27) were conducted in districts with a high prevalence of EVD and representing geographical and ethnic diversity (n = 228 participants). The final sample was composed of adults (52%) and children (48%) who were EVD-infected (46%) and -affected (42%) individuals, and community leaders (12%). Data were coded using a Grounded Theory approach informed by Thematic Content Analysis, and analyzed using NVivo. Interrater reliability was high, with Cohen’s κ = 0.80 or higher. Findings Participants described two main sources of EVD-related stress: isolation from the community because of social distancing and other prevention measures such as quarantine, and stigma related to infected or affected status. Participants linked experiences of social isolation and stigma to significant distress and feelings of ostracization. These experiences were particularly pronounced among children. Sources of support included community reintegration over time, and formal community efforts to provide education and establish protection bylaws. Interpretation This study found that social distancing and EVD-related stigma were each prominent sources of distress among participants. These results suggest that isolation because of infection, and the enduring stigmatization of infected individuals and their families, demand coordinated responses to prevent and mitigate additional psychosocial harm. Such responses should include close engagement with community leaders to combat misinformation and promote community reintegration. © 2022 Crea et al.

The ratio of Twitter bots has risen in tandem with their popularity. Bot detection is critical for combating misinformation and protecting the credibility of online disclosures. Current bot detection approaches rely on the Twitosphere’s topological structure, ignoring the heterogeneity among the profiles. Moreover, most techniques incorporate supervised learning, which depends strongly on large-scale training sets. Therefore, to overcome these issues, we proposed a novel entropy-based framework to detect correlated bots leveraging only user behavior. Specifically, real-time data of users is collected and their online behaviors are modeled as DNA sequences. We then determine the probability distribution of DNA sequences and compute relative entropy to evaluate the distance between the distributions. Accounts with entropy values less than a fixed threshold represent bots. Extensive experiments conducted in real-time Twitter data prove that the proposed detection technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with precision = 0.9471, recall = 0.9682, F1 score = 0.9511, and accuracy = 0.9457. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130156381"

The present study examined the potential for deliberative cognitive styles such as actively open-minded thinking and need for evidence in deterring belief in misinformation and promoting belief in true information related to COVID-19. In addition, regarding how responses to the pandemic have been politicized, the role of political orientation and motivated reasoning were also examined. We conducted a survey in South Korea (N = 1466) during May 2020. Participants answered measures related to demographics, open-minded thinking, need for evidence, and accuracy perceptions of COVID-19 misinformation and true information items. Multi-level analyses of the survey data found that while motivated reasoning was present, deliberative cognitive styles (actively open-minded thinking and need for evidence) decreased belief in misinformation without intensifying motivated reasoning tendencies. Findings also showed a political asymmetry where conservatives detected COVID-19 misinformation at a lesser rate. Overall, results suggest that health communication related to COVID-19 misinformation should pay attention to conservative populations. Results also imply that interventions that activate deliberative cognitive styles hold promise in reducing belief in COVID-19 misinformation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139153932"

Conventional approaches of fake news early detection (FNED) verify news' veracity with a predefined and indiscriminate detection position, which depends on domain experience and leads to unstable performance. More advanced methods address this problem with a proposed concept of adaptive detection position (ADP), i.e. the position where the veracity of the news record can be concluded. Yet these methods either lack theoretical reliability or weaken complex dependencies among multi-aspect clues, thus failing to provide practical and reasonable detection. This work focuses on the adaptive FNED problem and proposes a novel efficient and reliable deep state space model, namely AdaDebunk, which models the complex probabilistic dependencies. Specifically, a Bayes' theorem-based dynamic inference algorithm is designed to infer the ADPs and veracity, supporting the accumulation of multi-aspect clues. Besides, a training mechanism with hybrid loss is also designed to solve the over-/under-fitting problems, which further trades off the performance and generalization ability. Experiments on two real-world fake news datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of AdaDebunk. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, AdaDebunk achieves a 10% increase in F1 performance. Meanwhile, a case study is provided to demonstrate the reliability of AdaDebunk as well as our research motivation. © 2022 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140835052"

The once-prevailing view was that repeating misinformation increases its believability and should thus be avoided. However, misinformation reminders have more recently been shown to enhance memory and belief accuracy. We replicated such reminder benefits in two experiments using news headlines and compared those benefits against the effects of veracity labeling. Specifically, we examined the effects of labeling real news corrections to enhance conflict salience (Experiment 1) and labeling fake news on its debut to encourage intentional forgetting (Experiment 2). Participants first viewed real and fake news headlines with some fake news labeled as false. Participants then saw labeled and unlabeled real news corrections; labeled corrections appeared alone or after fake news reminders. Reminders promoted the best memory and belief accuracy, whereas veracity labels had selective effects. Correction labels led to intermediate memory and belief accuracy, whereas fake news labels improved accuracy for beliefs more than memory. The extent that real and fake news details were recalled together correlated with overall memory and belief differences across conditions, implicating a critical role for integrative encoding that was promoted most by fake news reminders. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144215891"

The belief of vaccine related misinformation including anti-vaccination conspiracy theories has been found to be associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Objective: While research suggests that these conspiracy theory beliefs may arise to satisfy unmet needs such as restoring loss of personal control, somewhat ironically these anti-vaccination conspiracy theories may frustrate these needs. This study examined the causal relationships between vaccination hesitancy, vaccination conspiracy theories, and vaccination related powerlessness. Methods: Using a stationary random intercepts cross lagged panel model, we investigated the temporal ordering of vaccination hesitancy, powerlessness, and vaccination conspiracy theory beliefs in a sample of Australian adults (N = 500) in a longitudinal study with 5-timepoints over 4-months between June and October 2021. Results: Results from a random intercept cross-lagged model, that separates between-person stability from within-person change, suggested that increased belief in vaccination conspiracy theories was associated with future increases in vaccination hesitancy and powerlessness (but not vice versa). Findings also showed that increases in vaccination hesitancy and conspiracy theory beliefs predicted respective increases from a person's trait-level mean at subsequent timepoints.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as GPT-2 mean that actors can now synthetically generate text in ways that mimic the style and substance of human-created news stories. We carried out three original experiments to study whether these AI-generated texts are credible and can influence opinions on foreign policy. The first evaluated human perceptions of AI-generated text relative to an original story. The second investigated the interaction between partisanship and AI-generated news. The third examined the distributions of perceived credibility across different AI model sizes. We find that individuals are largely incapable of distinguishing between AI- and human-generated text; partisanship affects the perceived credibility of the story; and exposure to the text does little to change individuals' policy views.

Nevertheless, this approach has inevitably allowed the development of DeepFake video sequences and images that could be altered so that the changes are not easily or explicitly detectable. Such alterations have been recently used to spread false news or disinformation. This study aims to identify Deepfaked videos and images and alert viewers to the possible falsity of the information. The current work presented a novel means of revealing fake face videos by cascading the convolution network with recurrent neural networks and fully connected network (FCN) models. The system detection approach utilizes the eye-blinking state in temporal video frames. Notwithstanding, it is deemed challenging to precisely depict (i) artificiality in fake videos and (ii) spatial information within the individual frame through this physiological signal. Spatial features were extracted using the VGG16 network and trained with the ImageNet dataset. The temporal features were then extracted in every 20 sequences through the LSTM network. On another note, the pre-processed eye-blinking state served as a probability to generate a novel BPD dataset. This newly-acquired dataset was fed to three models for training purposes with each entailing four, three, and six hidden layers, respectively. Every model constitutes a unique architecture and specific dropout value. Resultantly, the model optimally and accurately identified tampered videos within the dataset. The study model was assessed using the current BPD dataset based on one of the most complex datasets (FaceForensic++) with 90.8% accuracy. Such precision was successfully maintained in datasets that were not used in the training process. The training process was also accelerated by lowering the computation prerequisites.  © 2022 Saealal et al.

In understanding why people can be more or less at risk to believe in misinformation, emotional distress and education could play a crucial role. The present study aims to analyze the relationship among depressive symptoms, education, and beliefs in misinformation about COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. We do this through a cross-sectional study carried out on a random and representative sample of the Italian population that allows us to go and verify the co-evolution of many factors: i.e., beliefs in misinformation, symptoms of depression, perceptions about COVID-19, ways in which citizens got informed about the pandemic, and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education). The results show that the relationship between depression and beliefs in misinformation exists and is more complex than hypothesized because it is mediated by individual perceptions. In particular, the most at-risk people to believe in misinformation show higher bias perceptions, higher depression, and lower education.

In this regard, we aimed to analyze, from the perspective of medical staff, the way medical and non—medical information about the virus was communicated during the pandemic to encourage the development of future research or interventions in order to raise awareness about the way misinformation affected medical staff. Methods and findings The study was conducted on Romanian healthcare professionals. They were asked to answer to a questionnaire and the sample of the research includes 536 respondents. The findings revealed that most respondents stated that information about alternative treatments against the virus affected the credibility of health professionals, and that younger professionals believed to a greater extent that trust in doctors was affected. The research also showed that respondents were well informed about the drugs used in clinical trials in order to treat the virus. Conclusions Healthcare professionals declared that the spread of misinformation regarding alternative treatments, affected their credibility and the relationship with their patients. Healthcare professionals had knowledge about the drugs used in clinical trials, and they acknowledged the role of social media in spreading medical misinformation. However, younger professionals also believed that social media could be used to share official information about the virus. © 2022 Coman et al.

A review of the library literature reveals no attempts to define the concept. Nor does it reveal systematic attempts to develop interventions that teach the identification and evaluation of bias. Current pedagogical approaches (checklists and bias charts) tend to assume a self-evident definition that categorises bias as unquestioningly bad and disqualifying. Current approaches, however, fail to recognise the cognitive complexity of decoding bias within a source. A decoding process includes identifying the type of bias, determining an objective baseline, recognising biased features, and analysing bias’s impact. Based on work done from several fields—argumentation theory, media bias, media literacy, and history education—this paper proposes an operational definition of bias and a practical framework for conceptualising a process to identify and evaluate bias. This paper will explore the limitations of this framework, as well as existing source evaluation paradigms. If librarians want to prepare individuals to participate in a post-truth society, where disinformation weaponises bias by appealing to emotions and beliefs rather than facts, an inclusive and nuanced conception of bias is a necessary component of library instruction. © 2022, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

Previous studies mainly relied on a specific web platform to collect crucial evidence to detect fake content. The analysis identifies that retrieving clues from two or more different sources/web platforms gives more reliable prediction and confidence concerning a specific claim. This study proposed a novel multi-web platform voting framework that incorporates 4 sets of novel features: content, linguistic, similarity, and sentiments. The features have been gathered from each web-platforms to validate the news. To validate the fact/claim, a unique source platform is designed to collect relevant clues/headlines from two web platforms (YouTube, Google) based on specific queries and extracted features concerning each clue/headline. The proposed idea is to incorporate a unique platform to assist researchers in gathering relevant and vital evidence from diverse web platforms. After evaluation and validation, it has been identified that the built model is quite intelligent, gives promising results, and effectively predicts misleading information. The model correctly detected about 98% of the COVID misinformation on the constraint Covid-19 fake news dataset. Furthermore, it is observed that it is efficient to gather clues from multiple web platforms for more reliable predictions to validate the news.

Normally we cope with the problems of informational excess by relying on other people, including sociotechnical systems that mediate testimony and evidence. But when we attempt to engage in epistemic “superheroics” - withholding trust from others and trying to figure it all out for ourselves–these can malfunction in ways that make us vulnerable to forming irrational beliefs.

The 60 claims were related to three domains of health risk behavior (i.e., smoking, alcohol and vaccines). Claims were presented as Tweets or as simple text statements. We employed mouse tracking to measure reaction times, whether processing happens in discrete stages, and response uncertainty. We also examined whether health literacy was a moderating variable. The results indicate that information in statements and tweets is evaluated incrementally most of the time, but with overrides happening on some trials. Adequate health literacy scorers were equally certain when responding to tweets and statements, but they were more accurate when responding to tweets. Inadequate scorers were more confident on statements than on tweets but equally accurate on both.

In earthquake seismology, the most common misinformation and misleading popular beliefs generally relate to earthquake prediction, earthquake genesis, and potential causal relations between climate, weather and earthquake occurrence. As a public earthquake information and dissemination center, the Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Center (EMSC) has been confronted many times with this issue over the years. In this paper we describe several types of earthquake misinformation that the EMSC had to deal with during the 2018 Mayotte earthquake crisis and the 2021 La Palma seismic swarm. We present frequent misinformation topics such as earthquake predictions seen on our communication channels. Finally, we expose how, based on desk studies and users' surveys, the EMSC has progressively improved its communication strategy and tools to fight earthquake misinformation and restore trust in science. In this paper we elaborate on the observed temporality patterns for earthquake misinformation and the implications this may have to limit the magnitude of the phenomenon. We also discuss the importance of social, psychological and cultural factors in the appearance and therefore in the fight against misinformation. Finally, we emphasize the need to constantly adapt to new platforms, new beliefs, and advances in science to stay relevant and not allow misinformation to take hold.

Drawing on a survey experiment during the 2018 elections in Brazil, we find that fact-checking corrections in Brazil are ineffective at reducing misinformation.

To evaluate if heightened salience of misinformation accounts for the effects of the media literacy intervention, we also tested if recalling prior exposure to misinformation (priming-question) would yield the same results as watching the literacy video does. Two web-based experiments were conducted in South Korea. In Study 1 (N = 384), both liberals and conservatives found politically congenial information more truthful and shareworthy. Although misinformation priming lowered perceived truthfulness and sharing intention of partisan news, such effects were greater for false, rather than true information, thereby improving truth discernment. Study 2 (N = 600) replicated Study 1 findings, except that the misinformation priming lowered perceived truthfulness and the sharing intention across the board, regardless of the veracity of information. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the robust operation of partisan bias in the processing and sharing of partisan news. Misinformation priming aided in the detection of falsehood, but it also induced distrust in reliable information, posing a challenge in fighting misinformation. © 2023 The Author(s).

QAnon’s viral disinformation contributed to violent crimes committed by QAnon followers based on their conspiratorial beliefs, as well as to participation of some QAnon followers in the January 6th attack on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, and to widespread COVID vaccine hesitancy and rejection among believers. This paper presents a to-date unexplored additional cost of conspiracy beliefs: the emotional, social and political toll a relationship with QAnon followers can have on their loved ones. In an Internet survey of 288 U.S.-based participants, a majority (80%) reported having a QAnon-following family member or friend. These relationships have suffered as a result of the loved one’s conspiratorial beliefs, leading to self-reported emotional distress and reevaluation of participants’ views of the government and society. Participants with a QAnon loved one reported higher anxiety and PTSD than those without such connection. On average, participants viewed QAnon as significantly more radical (willing to engage in illegal or violent acts) than themselves. Perceived QAnon radicalization was predicted by own anxiety and by relationship deterioration with QAnon loved one. The discussion focuses on the importance of tracking these secondhand effects of conspiracy theories as drivers of political polarization. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135916653"

We aim to explore whether individuals prefer to share accurate information or not, and discover what factors increase people’s preferences for sharing accurate information. Combining behavioral economics experiments and psychology experiments, we construct “an information search—information sharing—information feedback experiment” to examine individuals’ behavior of sharing accurate information and its influencing factors. A total of 210 students are recruited for the laboratory experiment. Our results show that when individuals can control the accuracy of the information they obtain through their efforts, they are more willing to share accurate information with others. We also find that positive feedback from information receivers can promote the accuracy of information shared by individuals, and this effect works through reciprocity norms. Individuals with higher reciprocity are more willing to share accurate information, especially in the treatment with the role of reciprocity norms enhanced by feedback. These findings indicate that individuals who are willing to obtain accurate information prefer to share information, and information feedback can enhance this preference through reciprocity norms. This study captures individuals’ behavior and preference characteristics with regard to the accuracy of the information they share in the era of highly developed network interaction.

Based on the analysis of survey materials collected in Mariupol, Ukraine, around the time of the tumultuous events surrounding the Belarusian presidential election of 2020, we show that, given the right conditions, a critical juncture event in one country can rapidly influence existing patterns of relevant conspiracy belief in a neighbouring one. The right conditions, in this case, include a massive disinformation campaign channelled through (pro-)Russian media, against the backdrop of conspiracy theories already in circulation in Ukraine. The implication of this finding is that the disinformation weapon becomes far more effective when it manages to offer a straightforward explanation (a conspiracy theory) of a critical juncture event that is otherwise complex and multilayered, and that adequate psychological defence mechanisms are needed to mitigate and counter this effect.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132510336"

This article expands upon the ‘two core’ conspiritual convictions proposed by Ward and Voas that ‘1) a secret group covertly controls, or is trying to control, the political and social order, and 2) humanity is undergoing a “paradigm shift” in consciousness’. We identify an additional ten key convictions central to (con)spirituality, including those that result in vaccine hesitancy and/or refusal. We chose to bracket the ‘con’ to problematize the term, and to encompass a wider spectrum of spiritual beliefs and practices, including those that are non-controversial, those that may be deceptive cons, and/or those that draw on conspiracy theories. The article presents an analysis of these twelve (con)spiritual convictions, focusing on a sample of ‘Aussie Warriors’ selling (con)spirituality, and also on influencers attempting to counter the spread of dis/misinformation within wellness circles. In so doing, the article provides a more nuanced understanding of (con) spirituality and vaccine hesitancy, and a greater knowledge of the benefits and risks of spiritual practices and ideas during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, Equinox Publishing Ltd.

The model input of this approach is the specification of the flow of information. This enables the representation of (i) reliable information, (ii) noise, and (iii) disinformation, in a unified framework. Because the approach is designed to characterize the dynamics of the behavior of people, it is possible to quantify the impact of information control, including those resulting from the dissemination of disinformation. It is shown that if a decision maker assigns an exceptionally high weight on one of the alternative realities, then under the Bayesian logic their perception hardly changes in time even if evidences presented indicate that this alternative corresponds to a false reality. Thus, confirmation bias need not be incompatible with Bayesian updating. By observing the role played by noise in other areas of natural sciences, where noise is used to excite the system away from false attractors, a new approach to tackle the dark forces of fake news is proposed.

This essay highlights key insights from activities of the human rights and civic journalism network WITNESS, as they seek to prepare for new forms of media manipulation, such as deepfakes, and to ensure that an emergent “authenticity infrastructure” is in place to respond to global needs for reliable information without creating additional harms. Based on global consultations on perceived threats and prioritized solutions, their efforts are primarily targeted towards synthetic media and deepfakes, which not only facilitate audiovisual falsification (including non-consensual sexual images) but also, by being embedded in societal dynamics of surveillance and civil society suppression, they challenge real footage and so undermine the credibility of civic media and frontline witnessing (also known as “liar’s dividend”). They do this within a global context where journalists and some distant witness investigators self-identify as lacking relevant skills and capacity, and face inequity in access to detection technologies. Within this context, “authenticity infrastructure” tracks media provenance, integrity, and manipulation from camera to edit to distribution, and so comes to provide “verification subsidies” that enable distant witnesses to properly interpret eye-witness footage. This “authenticity infrastructure” and related tools are rapidly moving from niche to mainstream in the form of initiatives the Content Authenticity Initiative and Coalition for Content Authenticity and Provenance, raising key questions about who participates in the production and dissemination of audiovisual information, under what circumstances and to which effect for whom. Provenance risks being weaponized unless key concerns are integrated into infrastructure proposals and implementation. Data may be used against vulnerable witnesses, or the absence of a trail, for legitimate privacy and technological access reasons, used to undermine credibility. Regulatory and extra-legal co-option are also a fear as securitized “fake news” laws proliferate. The investigation of both phenomena, deepfakes and emergent authenticity infrastructure(s), this paper argues, is important as it highlights the risks related both to the “information disorder” of deepfakes as they challenge the credibility and safety of frontline witnesses and to responses to such “disorder,” as they risk worsening inequities in access to tools for mitigation or increasing exposure to harms from technology infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121374334"

Whether this finding extends to social media is unclear. Social media is a high-choice environment in which the cognitive effort required to separate truth from fiction, individuals’ penchant for select exposure, and motivated reasoning all may render fact-checks ineffective. Furthermore, large social media companies have largely refrained from permitting external researchers to administer experiments on their platforms. To investigate whether fact-checking can rebut misinformation on social media, we administer two experiments on large, nationally representative samples using a novel platform designed to mimic Facebook’s news feed. We observe corrections having large effects on factual beliefs (.62 on a five-point scale, p !:001). While misinformation degrades accuracy, our results offer strong evidence that fact-checks increase accuracy, even when tested on realistic simulations of social media platforms. © 2022 Southern Political Science Association.

In Studies 1 and 2, we find that empathy and dehumanization are strong, independent predictors of anti-migrant policy support and are associated with factually false negative beliefs about migrants. In Study 3, we interrogated the relationship between empathy/dehumanization, erroneous beliefs, and anti-migrant policy support with two interventions: a media intervention targeting empathy and dehumanization and an intervention that corrects erroneous beliefs. Both interventions were ineffective separately but reduced anti-migrant policy support when presented together.

The authors posit that when political leaders, such as the President of the USA, in conjunction with a group of state governors and city mayors, employed conspiracy theories and disinformation to achieve their political goals, they contributed to the massive spreads and fatalities of the virus, and they also undermined the credibility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the health-care professionals in providing the pertinent control guidelines and true scientific-based medical information. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a review of current studies that address the handling of global infectious diseases to build a better understanding of the issue of pandemics. They then employed a theoretical framework to link the massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic to political leaders, such as President Trump and the group of obsequious state governors and city mayors, who propagated conspiracy theories and disinformation through social media platforms to downplay the severity of the virus. The authors compared the massive spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA under President Trump to President Obama who handled H1N1, Ebola, Zika and Dengue. More importantly, the authors compared President Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to other political leaders in advanced countries where there were no concerted efforts to spread conspiracy theories and disinformation about the health risks of COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The authors' theoretical analysis alluded to the fact that political leaders, such as President Trump, who are engulfed in self-deceptions, self-projections and self-aggrandizements would engage in self-promotion and avoid accountability for their missteps in handling global pandemic shocks. In contrast, political leaders in other advanced countries did not downplay the severity thus their ability to curtail the spreads and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical viewpoints presented in this paper along with the derivations of the spreads–fatalities curtailment coefficients and the spread–fatality upsurge coefficients under Presidents Obama and Trump, respectively, may not be replicable. Given this plausible limitation, future research may need to provide a deep analysis of the amplifications of conspiracy theories and disinformation because they are now deeply rooted in the political economy of the USA. Furthermore, since scientists and medical professionals may not be able to forecast future epidemics or pandemics with pin-point accuracy nor predict how political leaders would disseminate health risks information associated with different pathogens, it is imperative that future research addresses the positive or adverse effects of conspiracy theories and disinformation that are now easily propagated simultaneously through different social media platforms, which are currently protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The multiplier effects of conspiracy theories and disinformation will continue to amplify the division about the authenticity of COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence or reemergence of other pathogens in the foreseeable future. Originality/value: The authors derived the unique spreads-fatalities curtailment coefficients to demonstrate how President Obama used effective collaboration and coordination at all levels of government in conjunction with medical experts to curtail the spreads and fatalities associated with H1N1, Ebola, Zika and Dengue. They further derived the spreads-fatalities upsurge coefficients to highlight how President Trump contributed to the spreads and fatalities of COVID-19 pandemic through his inability to collaborate and coordinate with state governors, city mayors and different health-care agencies at the national and international levels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120559537"

However, a validated instrument to measure the level of students’ acceptance on the CT about COVID-19 still remains unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the questionnaire of CT about COVID-19. The questionnaire consisted of 14 items and delivered online to the 400 students of Biology education in Indonesia. The data was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). All items have standard deviation between 1.60 and 2.63, but one item was revealed to have insignificant correlation. The EFA result indicated that the other 13 items had loading factor 0.5 and were categorized into three dimensions. The third dimension was eliminated after the administration of CFA due to only one item in the dimension (λ>0.5). There were three items in the first dimension and two items in the second dimension resulted in λ<0.5.

Although this demonstrates the public is averse to consuming news from unfamiliar media, we show that - conditional on exposure to them - unknown local and foreign media sources can influence public opinion to an extent similar to established mainstream news outlets on the same issues. This comparable effectiveness stems from the public's charitable evaluations of the credibility of unfamiliar news sources and their relatively low trust in familiar mainstream media.

COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy is a barrier to reaching a sufficient number of people to achieve herd immunity. This study aims to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and to identify the reasons contributing to vaccine hesitancy using the Theory of Planned Behavior. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May 2021 to June 2021. Using exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling, participants were recruited via social media and telecommunication platforms. We used a questionnaire that obtained information on participant socio-demographics, vaccine hesitancy, pseudoscientific practices, conspiracy beliefs, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, main reasons for not intending to get the COVID-19 vaccine; influential leaders, gatekeepers and anti-or pro-vaccination lobbies; and global vaccine hesitancy. A total of 354 responses (mean age = 32.5 years old ±13.6; 70.3% females) were included for analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 11.6%. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was significantly and positively associated with those who agreed with influential leaders, gatekeepers, and anti- or pro-vaccination lobbies (adjusted B coefficient = 1.355, p = 0.014), having a “wait and see” attitude to see if the COVID-19 vaccine is safe (adjusted B coefficient = 0. 822, p <0.001), perceiving that the vaccine will give them COVID-19 (adjusted B coefficient = 0.660, p <0.002), planned to use masks/others precautions instead (adjusted B coefficient = 0.345, p = 0.038) and having higher scores in conspiracy beliefs (adjusted B coefficient = 0.128, p <0.001). Concern about the costs associated with the vaccine (adjusted B coefficient = -0.518, p <0.001), subjective norms (adjusted B coefficient = -0.341, p <0.001), and perceived behavioural control (adjusted B coefficient = -0.202, p = 0.004) were negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia is low. Several factors were identified as being associated with vaccine hesitancy. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy would be useful in tailoring specific interventions involving positive messages by influential leaders, which address vaccine misinformation and the wait-and-see attitude which may delay the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines.

(2022) underscore four fundamental cognitive principles that underlie the human belief system.

I suggest that understanding these principles can help us defer and deflect false beliefs from becoming entrenched in consumer minds and offer ways to leverage the four principles in the service of truth. I then propose that we broaden our focus in the study of false beliefs in three ways--by focusing on prevention of false beliefs rather than correction, by diversifying the dependent measures we study and by addressing the role of identity in false belief maintenance. I conclude with a discussion of some thorny issues and the need for regulation in this sphere.

The CAH holds that an individual’s belief that media are hostile and influential increases the likelihood that the individual will participate in public discourse urging countermeasures. TPMI maintains that the belief that media are influential is associated with attitudes about media, though those attitudes need not be negative. Perceived exposure to fake news online positively predicted willingness to censor fake news in all countries, aligning with some prior research on both the CAH and the TPMI.

Throughout the pandemic, scientists and journalists have attributed lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates to a shifting set of factors including demography, experiences during the height of the pandemic, political views, and beliefs in conspiracy theories and misinformation, among others. However, these factors have rarely been tested comprehensively, in tandem, or alongside other potentially underlying psychological factors, thus limiting our understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. This cross-sectional study assesses a diverse set of correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy identified in previous studies using US survey data (N = 2055) collected in July–August 2021. The survey contained modules designed to assess various sociopolitical domains and anti- and pro-social personality characteristics hypothesized to shape vaccine hesitancy. Using logistic and multinomial regression, we found that the strongest correlate of vaccine hesitancy was belief in misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines, though we surmise that this common explanation may be endogenous to vaccine hesitancy. Political beliefs explained more variation in vaccine hesitancy—and in particular, vaccine refusal—after belief in COVID-19 vaccine misinformation was excluded from the analysis.

This study suggests that the cognitive paradox of simultaneously believing known facts less and new, “alternative facts” more is the outcome of a distrust mindset, characterized by spontaneous consideration of alternatives, including misinformation. We captured this paradox and its correlates in a scale that measures individuals' ability to distinguish between the truth value of well-established facts (“Earth rotates eastward around its own axis, completing a full rotation once in about 24 h”) and baseless “alternative facts” (“Earth can change its rotation direction and flip its axis, and we will never notice it”). Assuming that an anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitude arises from a chronically distrusting mindset, we sampled participants on Prolific who were pre-screened for their COVID-19 vaccine attitude based on earlier responses. We found that people who rejected COVID-19 vaccines believed well-established facts less, and “alternative facts” more, compared to supporters of the vaccine. Less discernment between truths and falsehoods was correlated with less intellectual humility, more distrust and greater reliance on one's intuition.

However, research that analyzes the predictors of this problem is still rarely done. Biology knowledge (BK) depicts the level of biological information mastered by students; attitude toward science (ATS) is related to students’ views when participating in science learning; while disbelief in conspiracy theories (DiCT) describes a person’s ability to ex-amine information that contradicts scientific truth. The current research was aimed at analyzing BK, ATS, and DiCT among Biology students, as well as the correlation between the three. The data collection instrument used was an online questionnaire comprising four main sections: demographic items, 15 Biology, and the General Public Questionnaire items, 40 ATS test items, and 8 DiCT items. Analysis was conducted on data from 820 respond-ents collected from February-March 2022. Some techniques for data analysis were applied, including frequency and percentage estimation, Kruskal-Wallis H test analysis, Dunn’s test analysis, Kendall’s Tau Correlation, and rank-based estimation regression. This research found that: 1) student’s ages and genders did not significantly contribute to any, while institutional status and study years did to BK and DiCT; 2) study program significantly contributed to ATS, and 3) ATS was found to not correlate significantly with DiCT, but BK was significant by the DiCT. Therefore, BK becomes the main competency that can protect students from unscientific conspiracy theories.

To fill in this gap, the current study examines the long-term relationship between misinformation and trust in the news media. Based on the reinforcing spirals model, we analyzed data from a three-wave panel survey collected in Chile between 2017 and 2019. We found a weak, over-time relationship between misinformation and media skepticism. Specifically, initial beliefs on factually dubious information were negatively correlated with subsequent levels of trust in the news media. Lower trust in the media, in turn, was related over time to higher levels of misinformation. However, we found no evidence of a reverse, parallel process where media trust shielded users against misinformation, further reinforcing trust in the news media. The lack of evidence of a downward spiral suggests that the corrosive effects of misinformation on attitudes toward the news media are less serious than originally suggested. We close with a discussion of directions for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107449893"

Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive survey research design was used for this study. A total of 1,200 social media users, regardless of their professions, were randomly selected for the study betweenmid-June and July 2020. Stratified and purposive sampling techniques were used for this study. The questionnaire was designed using Google form and administered using WhatsApp and Telegram to social media users above 18 years old in Nigeria. The data generated was analyzed using descriptive (frequency count) and inferential (mean) statistics, and was presented in tables. Findings: It was found that people make use of social media during COVID-19 pandemic for diverse reasons such as listening to announcement to be informed, knowing the necessary measures to take by those infected and spreading up-to-date information on the pandemic. Social media tools were highly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially WhatsApp and Zoom. Findings reflected that misinformation was spread on social media. This study also showed that the infodemic associated with COVID-19 is managed by confirming the source of the information before sharing it and trusting information from reliable sources. Research limitations/implications: The result of this research will contribute to the body of knowledge on social media application, fake news and the spread of COVID-19 infodemic in Nigeria and beyond. Practical implications: Infodemic is a disaster in the health sector. The spread of infodemic is capable of misleading people, losing trust in government, health providers and health regulatory authorities. This study will help social media users to know how to properly manage social media infodemic during a pandemic or any health-related situations. Originality/value: This study is novel as it approaches fake news from a COVID-19 perspective. Very few articles emanate from the developing countries in this area. This was because most of the narrative around fake news previously centered around the Western occurrences such as the Iraqi invasion by the USA, the US presidential elections and BREXIT. COVID-19 has demonstrated that the developing world is not immune from fake news as well. This study, therefore, assessed the management of infodemic associated with COVID-19 in Nigeria. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104249744"

While the field of Journalism Studies has already engaged in rich debates on how to rethink the truth conditions of user-generated content (UGC) in platform journalism, we argue that it has missed out on the ethico-political function of UGC as testimonials of lives-at-risk. If we wish to recognize and act on UGC as techno-social practices of witnessing human pain and death, we propose, then we need to push further the conceptual and analytical boundaries of the field. In this paper, we do this by introducing a view of UGC as flesh witnessing, that is as embodied and mobile testimonies of vulnerable others that, enabled by smartphones, enter global news environments as appeals to attention and action. Drawing on examples from the Syrian conflict, we provide an analysis of the narrative strategies through which flesh witnessing acquires truth-telling authority and we reflect on what is gained and lost in the process. Western story-telling, we conclude, strategically co-opts the affective dimension of flesh witnessing – its focus on child innocence, heroic martyrdom or the data aesthetics of destruction – and selectively minimizes its urgency by downplaying or effacing the bodies of non-western witnesses. This preoccupation with verification should not be subject to geopolitical formulations and needs to be combined with an explicit acknowledgement of the embodied voices of conflict as testimonies of the flesh whose often mortal vulnerability is, in fact, the very condition of possibility upon which western broadcasting rests. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121343011"

So far, state-of-the-art socio-psychological theories and cognitive models focus on explaining how the accuracy of fake news is judged on average, with little consideration of the individual. In this paper, a breadth of core models are comparatively assessed on their predictive accuracy for the individual decision maker, i.e., how well can models predict an individual’s decision before the decision is made. To conduct this analysis, it requires the raw responses of each individual and the implementation and adaption of theories to predict the individual’s response. Building on methods formerly applied on smaller and more limited datasets, we used three previously collected large datasets with a total of 3794 participants and searched for, analyzed and refined existing classical and heuristic modeling approaches. The results suggest that classical reasoning, sentiment analysis models and heuristic approaches can best predict the “Accept” or “Reject” response of a person, headed by a model put together from research by Jay Van Bavel, while other models such as an implementation of “motivated reasoning” performed worse. Further, hybrid models that combine pairs of individual models achieve a significant increase in performance, pointing to an adaptive toolbox. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129901837"

To bring community voices from such settlements to the center of COVID-19 response strategies, we undertook a study in the urban informal settlements of Dharavi, Mumbai, from September 2020-April 2021. In this study, we have examined the awareness, attitudes, reported practices, and some broader experiences of the community in Dharavi with respect to COVID-19. We have used a mixed-methods approach, that included a cross-sectional survey of 468 people, and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 49 people living in this area. Data was collected via a mix of phone and face-to-face interviews. We have presented here the descriptive statistics from the survey and the key themes that emerged from our qualitative data. People reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19, with television (90%), family and friends (56%), and social media (47%) being the main sources of information. The knowledge people had, however, was not free of misconceptions and fear; people were scared of being forcefully quarantined and dying alone during the early days of COVID-19. These fears had negative repercussions in the form of patient-related stigma and hesitancy in seeking healthcare. A year into the pandemic, however, people reported a shift in attitudes from ‘extreme fear to low fear’ (67% reported perceiving low/no COVID risk in October 2020), contributing to a general laxity in following COVID-appropriate behaviors. Currently, the community is immensely concerned about the revival of livelihoods, that have been adversely impacted due to the lockdown in 2020 as well as the continued ‘othering’ of Dharavi for being a COVID hotspot. These findings suggest that urban informal settlements like Dharavi need community-level messaging that counters misinformation and denial of the outbreak; local reinforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviours; and long-term social protection measures. © 2022 Ramani et al.

How we value the origins of knowledge – through feelings and intuition or evidence and data – has important implications for our susceptibility to misinformation. This project explores how these epistemic motivations correlate with political ideology, party identification, and favorability towards President Trump, and how epistemic and political constructs predict belief in misinformation about COVID and the 2020 election. Results from a US national survey from Nov-Dec 2020 illustrate that Republicans, conservatives, and those favorable towards President Trump held greater misperceptions about COVID and the 2020 election. Additionally, epistemic motivations were associated with political preferences; Republicans and conservatives were more likely to reject evidence, and Trump supporters more likely to value feelings and intuition. Mediation analyses support the proposition that Trump favorability, Republicanism, and conservatism may help account for the relationships between epistemic motivations and misperceptions.

We report two online human-subject experiments investigating an associative inference version in which participants viewed overlapping real-news pairs (AB&BC) that could later be linked to support inferences of misinformation (AC). In each experiment, we examined participants’ recognition and perceived accuracy of snippets of news articles presented as tweets across two phases. At Phase 1, only real-news tweets were presented, which were associated with political news of Phase 2 at three levels: real, fake, and fake with inference. In Experiment 2, participants’ cognitive abilitywas also assessed. Participants recognized more but gave lower accuracy ratings for the fake news with inference than the fake news in both experiments. The effect of associative inference wasmore evident in the perceived accuracy ratings for participants of higher cognitive ability than those of lower cognitive ability.We conclude that associative inference can make people become susceptible to misinformation.

Recognizing that individuals can hold beliefs that align with a persuasive message without those beliefs having been influenced by it, we derive empirical criteria to test for evidence of these constructs that center on yielding or not yielding to misinformation in mediated contexts.

I argue, although it is important to rebut false information and stop their spread, social scientists need to analyse how such anti-science claims are discursively framed and interpreted. Specifically, I show how the framing of the anti-science conspiracies utilise the credibility of science and scientists. I also explore how the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were given different meaning among different social groups. The article is divided into three sections. In the first section I analyse the discursive emplotment of the Plandemic video that had Dr Judy Mikovits presenting several COVID–19 conspiracy theories and went viral before it was taken down from major social media platforms. I show how the video draws on the credibility of science, scientists, and scientific journals to present misinformation and conspiracies claims against vaccination, mask wearing, etc. The second section explores how COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies were interpreted among the African-American community by drawing on the history of black community’s experiences in the US and as such how their interpretations stand in contrast to the interpretations of the COVID–19 misinformation and conspiracies among the White community. The last section analyses the role of STS in engaging with anti-science and post-truth issues and emphasises the need to excavate genealogies of the present even with regard to misinformation and conspiracies. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104421108"

Recently, researchers have started to study how motivated reasoning about news content influences misinformation susceptibility. However, because the importance of source credibility in the persuasion process is well-documented, and given that source similarity contributes to credibility evaluations, this raises the question of whether individuals are more susceptible to misinformation from ideologically congruent news sources because they find them to be more credible. In a large between-subject pilot (N = 656) and a pre-registered online mixed-subject experiment with a US sample (N = 150) using simulated social media posts, we find clear evidence that both liberals and conservatives judge misinformation to be more accurate when the source is politically congruent, and that this effect is mediated by perceived source credibility. We show that source effects play a greater role in veracity judgements for liberals than conservatives, but that individuals from both sides of the spectrum judge politically congruent sources as less slanted and more credible. These findings add to our current understanding of source effects in online news environments and provide evidence for the influential effect of perceived source similarity and perceived credibility in misinformation susceptibility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115791087"

Across three experiments, we examined whether these memory errors could be minimized by placing evaluations before the entire claim is stated (e.g., “No, X did not do Y, as A claims”), rather than after (e.g., “A claims X did Y. No, this is false”). Participants remembered whether fact-checked political claims were affirmed or negated immediately (Experiment 1) and 1 week later (Experiment 2).

This development prompted academic libraries/librarians not to trust completely, some of the information (contents) in the social media arena. In order to avoid errors, rumours, and misinformation which can easily spread through social media channels, librarians as information professionals become duty-bound to check the validity and reliability of the contents so as to maintain trust, credibility, and authority in the social media units of the libraries. Therefore, this study is set (a) to investigate how academic libraries/librarians create users' trust, build a reputation and maintain social authority; and,( b) to explore the constraints of academic libraries/librarians in maintaining social media authority in Nigerian academic libraries. It is a qualitative research approach, using Rogers's 2010 Diffusion of Innovation theory, based on the Innovation Decision Process. The results indicated that academic libraries/librarians have been in the vanguard of establishing credible content on their social media platforms. Libraries and librarians are shifting focus from the traditional method of checking the authority and validity of information (content) to a new way of assessing the authority of content in academic libraries. Also, it was found that academic librarians' behavioral attitudes towards social media content such as inappropriate content, lack of teamwork, lack of management support, and lack of social media policies, among other issues are impediments to the flow of establishing credible social media authority in the academic libraries. Notwithstanding, the researchers offer suggestions for social media libraries/librarians to brace up and work-hand-glove to strategize and know more about the contents the customers may have passion therein, in order to earn trust, maintain online reputation and gain social authority in the academic libraries. © 2022, Archlib and Information Services Ltd.

Hence, fake news has become prevalent as people rely on information explored online. This research aims to examine the social-cultural impacts of fake news adaptation behavior from the social psychological perspective by investigating the relationship between collectivism, social support, sense of belonging, social endorsement, fear of missing out, perceived credibility, issue involvement, and adaptation on fake news among young adults in Malaysia. A quantitative research approach with an online self-administered survey was conducted, and 451 responses were obtained through snowball sampling. In the data analysis, measurement and structural equation modeling were adopted. Findings showed that the relationships among adaptation behaviors on fake news were significantly supported. This research consummates the understanding of the influences of social-cultural (collectivism) on the judgment formation of adaptation among internet users on fake news. © 2022, University of San Jose-Recoletos.

In its emphasis on the political protest as a site of insecurity, I argue that contemporary cybersecurity has widened its traditional spatiality ‘beyond the computer’. In the article’s second half, I argue that the racialization of cybersecurity has underwritten a politics of truth ultimately concerned less with parsing true from false, and more with defining the boundaries of secure political knowledge and communication.

Online networks are a contributing cause of this spread, with echo chambers and polarization indicative of the interplay between the search behaviours of users and reinforcement processes within the system they inhabit. Recent empirical work has focused on interventions aimed at inoculating people against misinformation, yielding success on the individual level. However, given the evolving, dynamic information context of online networks, important questions remain regarding how such inoculation interventions interact with network systems. Here we use an agent-based model of a social network populated with belief-updating users. We find that although equally rational agents may be assisted by inoculation interventions to reject misinformation, even among such agents, intervention efficacy is temporally sensitive. We find that as beliefs disseminate, users form self-reinforcing echo chambers, leading to belief consolidation-irrespective of their veracity. Interrupting this process requires 'front-loading' of inoculation interventions by targeting critical thresholds of network users before consolidation occurs. We further demonstrate the value of harnessing tipping point dynamics for herd immunity effects, and note that inoculation processes do not necessarily lead to increased rates of 'false-positive' rejections of truthful communications.  © 2022 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135900722"

We conducted a community-based participatory research study using qualitative methods to explore knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination among Black/African American, Latinx, and Chinese American residents of the San Francisco Bay Area and assess their views on vaccination outreach and delivery strategies. Methods and findings Data were collected from January 14, 2021, to February 24, 2021, with adult residents (N = 109 [Female: N = 76; 70%]) in San Francisco. Focus groups (N = 10) and in-depth interviews (N = 25) were conducted among Black/African Americans (N = 35), Latinx (N = 40), and Chinese Americans (n = 34) in English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Themes were identified using grounded field theory, and included misinformation, mistrust of government and health institutions, and linguistic and other barriers to vaccine access. All three racial/ethnic groups had experiences with vaccine misinformation and information overload. Many African American and Latinx participants cited structural and interpersonal racism, and anti-immigrant discrimination, as factors reducing their trust in government and public health disseminated information and their willingness to be vaccinated. Participants expressed trust in community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations and community-run clinics. Participants often experienced barriers to vaccine access, such as transportation to drive-in sites, with Latinx and Chinese American groups also frequently citing language barriers. Conclusions Vaccine outreach strategies must acknowledge how longstanding systemic, institutional, and structural racism contributes to mistrust in government and health institutions and engage with and support trusted messengers from the community to eliminate cultural, linguistic, and other barriers to vaccine access.

In hybrid lab-field studies, exposure to social-media content can be randomized, and the impact on attitudes and beliefs can be measured using surveys, or exposure to treatments can be randomized within survey experiments, and their impact on subsequent online behavior can be observed. In field experiments conducted on social media, randomized treatments can be administered directly to users in the online environment (e.g., via social-tie invitations, private messages, or public posts) without revealing that they are part of an experiment, and the effects on subsequent online behavior can then be observed. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed, along with practical advice and central ethical constraints on such studies. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120491400"

To examine the nature of this relationship, we set up an experiment that mimics the mechanics of Twitter, allowing us to observe the user perception, their reaction in the face of shown claims and the factual veracity of those claims. We find that perceived veracity significantly predicts how likely a user is to react, with higher perceived veracity leading to higher reaction rates. Additionally, we confirm that fake news is inherently more likely to be shared than other types of news. Lastly, we identify an activist-type behavior, meaning that belief in fake news is associated with significantly disproportionate spreading (compared to belief in true news).

Theories undergo three stages (modes): a formative, exploratory, heuristic phase of theory conception, a developmental phase of theory-pruning and refinement, and a mature, rigorous phase of testing specific, explicit models. The first phase depends on Feyerabendian open possibility, the second on theoretical plausibility and internal coherence, and the third on testability (falsifiability, predictive efficacy). Multiple perspectives produce variety necessary for theory formation, whereas explicit agreement on evaluative criteria is essential for testing. Hertzian observer-mechanics of empirical-deductive scientific models are outlined that use semiotic operations of measurement/evaluation, computation, and physical action/construction. If models can be fully operationalized, then they can be intersubjectively verified (tested) irrespective of metaphysical, theoretical, value-, or culture-based disagreements. Verificationism can be expanded beyond simple predictive efficacy to incorporate testing for pragmatic, functional efficacy in engineering, medicine, and design contexts. Such a more open, pragmatist, operationalist, epistemically-constructivist perspective is suggested in which verification is contingent on the type of assertion (e.g., heuristic, analytic, empirical, pragmatic), its intended purpose, degree and reliability of model-based evidence, and existence of alternate, compet-ing predictive models. Suggestions for epistemological hygiene amidst the world-wide pandemic of misinformation and propaganda are offered. © 2022 by the author.

In this paper, we propose using the political diversity of a website’s audience as a quality signal. Using news source reliability ratings from domain experts and web browsing data from a diverse sample of 6,890 US residents, we first show that websites with more extreme and less politically diverse audiences have lower journalistic standards. We then incorporate audience diversity into a standard collaborative filtering framework and show that our improved algorithm increases the trustworthiness of websites suggested to users—especially those who most frequently consume misinformation—while keeping recommendations relevant. These findings suggest that partisan audience diversity is a valuable signal of higher journalistic standards that should be incorporated into algorithmic ranking decisions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124166549"

The main goal of this paper is to investigate to what extent this effect can be reduced using the procedure of inoculation and how it can be moderated by the reliability of corrections’ sources. The results show that the reliability of corrections’ sources did not affect their processing when participants were not inoculated. However, inoculated participants relied on misinformation less when the correction came from a highly credible source. For this source condition, as a result of inoculation, a significant increase in belief in retraction, as well as a decrease in belief in misinformation was also found. Contrary to previous reports, belief in misinformation rather than belief in retraction predicted reliance on misinformation. These findings are of both great practical importance as certain boundary conditions for inoculation efficiency have been discovered to reduce the impact of the continued influence of misinformation, and theoretical, as they provide insight into the mechanisms behind CIE. The results were interpreted in terms of existing CIE theories as well as within the remembering framework, which describes the conversion from memory traces to behavioral manifestations of memory.

While both exclusion by omission and out-group distrust help sustain echo chambers, neither defines the phenomenon. I develop a social network model of echo chambers which focuses on the role of belief-reinforcing echoes. First, I argue that the model allows us to incorporate Nguyen's main point about distrust without construing other commentators as deeply mistaken about the nature of echo chambers.

Particularly on this second dimension, I develop the idea that relational reasoning is key to understanding how individuals integrate new information within their internal belief systems.

This paper examines the potential of the motivated reasoning approach as a framework explaining why people prefer and use health-related misinformation. Method. Conceptual analysis of a sample of 41 studies drawing on the motivated reasoning approach examine the selection and use of information and misinformation. Results. Preferring and using health-related misinformation occur most likely when people are primarily driven by directional goals. They tend to give rise to confirmation bias which favours the adherence to existing beliefs about the relevance of information sources of certain types, for example, websites advocating anti-vaccination ideas. Moreover, disconfirmation bias results in the rejection of information that challenges the existing beliefs about an issue. Directional goals seldom appear in a pure form because motivated reasoning is also driven by accuracy goals motivating people to select and use information that enables them to support, justify and defend their beliefs against critique. Conclusion. Motivated reasoning offers a relatively robust psychological approach to the study of reasons by which people prefer and use misinformation in order to confirm their existing beliefs and to protect their identities. There is a need to explore further the potential and limitations of the motivated reasoning approach by conducting empirical research focusing on controversial and politicized issues such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, University of Boras.

Path analysis showed that anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs influenced intention to get vaccinated both directly and indirectly through the mediating effects of attitude, trust in science, and trust in government.

However, much remains to be learned about the psychological mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Most theorizing in this domain has focused on cognitive mechanisms. Yet some proposed cognitive explanations provide reason to believe that motivational mechanisms might also play a role. The present research tested the prediction that retractions of misinformation produce feelings of psychological discomfort that motivate one to disregard the retraction to reduce this discomfort. Studies 1 and 2 found that retractions of misinformation elicit psychological discomfort, and this discomfort predicts continued belief in and use of misinformation. Study 3 showed that the relations between discomfort and continued belief in and use of misinformation are causal in nature by manipulating how participants appraised the meaning of discomfort. These findings suggest that discomfort could play a key mechanistic role in the CIE, and that changing how people interpret this discomfort can make retractions more effective at reducing continued belief in misinformation. © 2021, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115105709"

It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We compared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be more sensitive in discovering fake news items. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124320464"

Methods We conducted a qualitative study to understand government officials and civil society stakeholders’ perceptions of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India. We conducted in-depth phone interviews using a structured guide of open-ended questions with 21 participants from international and national non-governmental organizations, professional associations, and universities, and state and national government–six national-level stakeholders in New Delhi, six state-level stakeholders in Uttar Pradesh, six in Kerala, and three in Gujarat–from July 2020 to October 2020. We analyzed data through a multi-stage process following Grounded Theory. We present findings on individual-level, contextual, and vaccine/vaccination program-specific factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Results We identified multiple drivers and complex ways they influence vaccine beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors from the perspective of government officials and civil society stakeholders involved in vaccine campaigns. Important individual-level influences were low awareness of the benefits of vaccination, safety concerns, especially related to mild adverse events following immunization, and mistrust in government and health service quality. Contextual-level factors included communications, the media environment, and social media, which serves as a major conduit of misinformation and driver of hesitancy, as well as sociodemographic factors–specific drivers varied widely by income, education, urban/rural setting, and across religious and cultural groups. Among vaccine/vaccination-level issues, vaccine program design and delivery and the role of health care professionals emerged as the strongest determinants of hesitancy. Conclusions Drivers of vaccine hesitancy in India, as elsewhere, vary widely by local context; successful interventions should address individual, contextual, and vaccine-specific factors. While previous studies focused on individual-level factors, our study demonstrates the equal importance of contextual and vaccine-specific influences, especially the communication and media environment, influential leaders, sociodemographic factors, and frontline health workers.

This truth-by-repetition effect is of relevance for explaining belief in fake news, conspiracy theories, or misinformation effects. To ascertain whether increased motivation could reduce this effect, we tested the influence of monetary incentives on participants’ truth judgments. We used a standard truth paradigm, consisting of a presentation and judgment phase with factually true and false information, and incentivized every truth judgment. Monetary incentives may influence truth judgments in two ways. First, participants may rely more on relevant knowledge, leading to better discrimination between true and false statements. Second, participants may rely less on repetition, leading to a lower bias to respond “true.” We tested these predictions in a preregistered and high-powered experiment. However, incentives did not influence the percentage of “true” judgments or correct responses in general, despite participants’ longer response times in the incentivized conditions and evidence for knowledge about the statements. Our findings show that even monetary consequences do not protect against the truth-by-repetition effect, further substantiating its robustness and relevance and highlighting its potential hazardous effects when used in purposeful misinformation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121362020"

Collectives are vulnerable to hidden-profile environments, where task-relevant information is unevenly distributed across individuals. To do well in this task, information aggregation must equally weigh minority and majority views against simple but inefficient majority-based decisions. In an experimental design, human volunteers working in teams of 10 were asked to solve a hidden-profile prediction task. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn people’s hidden information distribution by observing how people’s judgments correlated over time. A bot was designed to sample responses from the VAE latent embedding to selectively support opinions proportionally to their under-representation in the team. We show that the presence of a single bot (representing 10% of team members) can significantly increase the polarization between minority and majority opinions by making minority opinions less prone to social influence. Although the effects on hybrid team performance were small, the bot presence significantly influenced opinion dynamics and individual accuracy. These findings show that self-supervized machine learning techniques can be used to design algorithms that can sway opinion dynamics and group outcomes. © 2022 Pescetelli et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135452795"

Identifying misperceptions that can fuel vaccine hesitancy and creating effective communication strategies to overcome them are a global public health priority3–5. Medical doctors are a trusted source of advice about vaccinations6, but media reports may create an inaccurate impression that vaccine controversy is prevalent among doctors, even when a broad consensus exists7,8. Here we show that public misperceptions about the views of doctors on the COVID-19 vaccines are widespread, and correcting them increases vaccine uptake. We implement a survey among 9,650 doctors in the Czech Republic and find that 90% of doctors trust the vaccines. Next, we show that 90% of respondents in a nationally representative sample (n = 2,101) underestimate doctors’ trust; the most common belief is that only 50% of doctors trust the vaccines. Finally, we integrate randomized provision of information about the true views held by doctors into a longitudinal data collection that regularly monitors vaccination status over 9 months. The treatment recalibrates beliefs and leads to a persistent increase in vaccine uptake. The approach demonstrated in this paper shows how the engagement of professional medical associations, with their unparalleled capacity to elicit individual views of doctors on a large scale, can help to create a cheap, scalable intervention that has lasting positive impacts on health behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131309560"

Witnesses might be less likely to believe and therefore take on false information from intoxicated co-witnesses, due to the common belief that alcohol impairs memory performance. This paper presents an online study in which participants (n = 281) watched a video of a mock crime taking place outside a pub that included a witness either visibly consuming wine or a soft drink. Participants then read a statement from the witness that varied in the number of false details it contained before being asked to recall the crime. We found that the intoxicated witness was regarded as significantly less credible, but participants were not less likely to report misinformation from them. This suggests that intoxication status impacts one’s perception of how credible a source is, but not one’s ability to reject false suggestions from this source. Our findings reinforce the importance of minimizing co-witness discussion prior to interview, and not to assume that people automatically (correctly or not) discount information provided by intoxicated co-witnesses.

Therefore, early and accurate detection of rumors in social networks is of vital importance before they spread on a large scale. Considering the small-world property of social networks, the source tweet-word graph is decomposed from the global graph of rumors, and a rumor detection method based on graph attention network of source tweet-word graph is proposed to fully learn the structure of rumor propagation and the deep representation of text contents. Specifically, the proposed model can adequately capture the contextual semantic association representation of source tweets during the propagation and extract semantic features. For the data sparseness of the early stage of information dissemination, text attention mechanism based on opinion similarity can aggregate and capture more tweet propagation structure features to help improve the efficiency of early detection of rumors. Through the analysis of the experimental results on real public datasets, the rumor detection performance of the proposed method is better than that of other baseline methods. Especially in the early rumor detection tasks, the proposed method can detect rumors with an accuracy of nearly 90% in the early stage of information dissemination. And it still has good robustness with noise interference. Copyright: © 2022 Jia et al.

Such scepticism is politically skewed in the USA, with conservatives more likely to downplay or deny the risks of the virus. However, the hospitalization of President Trump with COVID-19 in October 2020 served as a high-profile exemplar of the reality and risks of the virus, and as such may have influenced opinions, particularly for US conservatives. We investigate whether President Trump testing positive was associated with changes in public attitudes towards the virus. In two studies, we surveyed independent representative US samples before and after the announcement of Trump's illness. In Study 1, measuring risk perceptions of the virus, we find that participants surveyed before and after the announcement did not differ in their risk perception regardless of political orientation. In Study 2, measuring belief that the virus is a hoax, we find that among those on the far right of the political spectrum, hoax belief was lower for those surveyed after the announcement, suggesting that Trump's hospitalization may have affected the beliefs of those most receptive to the President's earlier suggestions that the virus might be a hoax.  © 2022 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135723608"

Both studies revealed that people often judged news headlines as fake, suggesting a deception-bias for news in social media. Across studies, we observed an average detection accuracy of approximately 51%, a level consistent with most research using this deception detection paradigm with equal lie-truth base-rates. Study 2 evaluated the effects of endorsement cues in social media (e.g., Facebook likes) on message credibility and detection accuracy. Results showed that headlines associated with a high number of Facebook likes increased credibility, thereby enhancing detection accuracy for real news but undermining accuracy for fake news.

I argue that fakes can interfere with one or more of the truth, belief, and warrant conditions on knowledge. I devote most of my attention to the effects of online fakes on satisfaction of the warrant condition, as these have received comparatively little attention. I consider three accounts of the conditions under which fakes compromise the warrant condition. I argue for the third of these accounts, according to which the propensity of fakes to exist in an environment threatens warrant acquisition in that environment.

Both researchers and practitioners have proposed parking policy interventions that tend to rely on the assumption that parkers have perfect information about the availability of parking options and their characteristics (prices and quality) when determining consumers’ behavior. However, research shows that when information acquisition (search) is costly it is rational for consumers not to be fully informed at the expense of their taking non-optimal decisions, with negative welfare implications. We conduct an empirical study of the level of knowledge and information held by drivers in the car parking market. We draw on a survey conducted with 576 garage customers in Barcelona to estimate different regression models to assess how drivers transform information into actual knowledge, identifying the factors that aggravate/mitigate misinformation and misperception (subjective information levels and its accuracy). We find that parkers know little about available parking alternatives and their prices, and the accuracy of their knowledge is poor and biased towards prioritizing curbside parking. Costly search does not help drivers increase their knowledge levels, with garage facilities’ and surrounding areas’ characteristics playing a relevant role. We also find that garages have effective obfuscation strategies to keep drivers uninformed and exploit their localized market power by reducing price saliency and increasing fee complexity. Our results suggest that information should be carefully considered in the design and implementation of parking policy interventions and transport information systems, in order to avoid undesired market distortions. © 2022 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128408204"

While there are recent studies that built machine learning models that detect fake news in several languages, lack of studies in detecting fake news in the Arabic language is scare. Hence, in this paper, we study the issue of fake news detection in the Arabic language based on textual analysis. In an attempt to address the challenges of authenticating news, we introduce a supervised machine learning model that classifies Arabic news articles based on their context’s credibility. We also introduce the first dataset of Arabic fake news articles composed through crowdsourcing. Subsequently, to extract textual features from the articles, we create a unique approach of forming Arabic lexical wordlists and design an Arabic Natural Language Processing tool to perform textual features extraction.

Among the main findings, journalists are aware that fake news is a problem to be faced, as the blame for the dissemination of false news erroneously lies with the profession. They are conscious that something must be done and agree that the best way to fight against fake news is to invest in media literacy.

Through this lens, we interrogate the ways that superficial approaches to complex issues such as mis-or disinformation and racism inhibit the kinds of engagement and (un)learning that transformative pedagogy requires as well as the structural conditions that give rise to such approaches. We find that information literacy and diversity one-shots emerged within the neoliberal turn in higher education and share a common philosophical foundation in liberalism and a belief that educated publics will come to consensus in the interest of the social good; they are based in narratives of individual deficiency, empowerment, and self-work. They are “pedagogies of the practical,” practices that ultimately fail to challenge white supremacist structures in higher education. Because education is about affect, emotion, and beliefs as well as knowledge, transactional one-shots can never truly be transformational or liberatory.

The capacity of distorted information to interfere in election processes or in political agendas has led different actors to create verification initiatives, which operate in partnership with the mass media. Recently, during the 2020 health crisis, false information has proved to have damaging power not only at the levels of politics or communication, but also at a health level. Therefore, the social need to access reliable and quality information, as well as verified information aimed at eradicating hoaxes, becomes evident. This paper focuses on the European context, analyzing the relationship between active verifiers and television stations that are members of the CIRCOM Network, considering their strategies and verification programs. Using a qualitative methodology an exploratory study has been carried out, mapping initiatives and stations by assessing their contribution of verified information to society. © 2021 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147186204"

The proposed research addresses the unique and innovative approach to controlling COVID-19 rumors through the power of opinion leaders (OLs) in OSN. The entire process is partitioned into two phases; the first phase describes the novel Reputation-based Opinion Leader Identification (ROLI) algorithm, including a unique voting method to identify the top-T OLs in the OSN. The second phase describes the technique to measure the aggregated polarity score of each posted tweet/post and compute each user's reputation. The empirical reputation is utilized to calculate the user's trust, the post's entropy, and its veracity. If the experimental entropy of the post is lower than the empirical threshold value, the post is likely to be categorized as a rumor. The proposed approach operated on Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit social networks for validation. The ROLI algorithm provides 91% accuracy, 93% precision, 95% recall, and 94% F1-score over other Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to find OLs in OSN. Moreover, the proposed approach's rumor controlling effectiveness and efficiency is also estimated based on three standard metrics; affected degree, represser degree, and diffuser degree, and obtained 26%, 22%, and 23% improvement, respectively. The concluding outcomes illustrate that the influence of OLs is exceptionally significant in controlling COVID-19 rumors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132884962"

CAVs manipulated by users, traffic controllers or third parties may act in deceitful ways. This scene-setting work introduces the deceitful CAV, a vehicle that operates in a deceitful manner towards routing and control functionality for ‘selfish’ or malicious purposes and contextualises its diverse expressions and dimensions. It specifically offers a systematic taxonomy of eight distinctive deceitful behaviours namely: suppression/camouflage, overloading, mistake, substitution, target conditioning, repackaging capability signatures, amplification and reinforcing impression. These as exemplified by their most common attack forms (i.e., starvation, denial-of-service, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, poisoning, masquerading, flooding and spoofing) are then benchmarked against five key dimensions referring to time frame (short to long duration), engagement (localised to systemic), urban traffic controller infrastructure (single to multiple components), scale (low to high), and impact (low to high). We then suggest mitigation strategies to protect CAV technology against these dangers. These span from purely technological measures referring to the machine-centric triad of vehicles, communication, and control system including adversarial training, heuristic decision algorithms and weighted voting mechanisms to human factor measures that focus on education, training, awareness enhancement, licensing and legislation initiatives that will enable users and controllers to prevent, control or report deceitful activities. © 2022 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129315953"

In this vein, Wikipedia once again highlighted its cultural role in the production of available knowledge in the face of new knowledge. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyse the specific entry of desinformación –disinformation in English– in the Spanish version of Wikipedia, given the importance that this concept has acquired during the coronavirus crisis and given the need to disseminate a homogeneous definition of this term. For that purpose, we have applied the content analysis method to a textual case, that is, to the disinformation entry in Wikipedia. The main results show that the basic characteristics of the Spanish entry of desinformación on Wikipedia are not the suitable ones to inform users or readers of the real meaning of this concept. Furthermore, the content of the Wikipedia disinformation entry is incomplete, disjointed and of dubious reliability.

Five studies examined how conservative and liberal Americans responded to media reports of politicians’ falsehoods— that is, flagged falsehoods (FFs). Even accounting for partisan biases in how much participants dismissed such reports as fake news and assumed that such lies were unintentional, we consistently observed partisan evaluations in how much FFs were seen as justifiable: Republicans and Democrats alike saw their own party’s FFs as more acceptable (Studies 1–4). This charitability did not reflect unconditional in-group favoritism. Instead, it was strongest for policy FFs—those meant to advance a party’s explicit agenda—as opposed to personal FFs about a politician’s past (Study 2) or electoral FFs that strayed from parties’ explicit goals by aiming to disenfranchise legally eligible voters (Study 4). Although FFs can undermine general trustworthiness in the eyes of both in-group and out-group members, policy FFs in particular signal partisan trustworthiness (Studies 3–5)—the belief that a politician can be trusted by their own political side and not by the other. For likeminded partisans, such partisan trustworthiness predicted not only the perceived acceptability of FFs, but also perceptions of the politician as a more prototypically moral actor, even outside of the political sphere.

There is, however, a risk that the uncontrolled spread of information could increase the adverse effects of the COVID-19 health emergency through the influence of false and misleading news. Yet governments may well use health emergency regulation as a pretext for implementing draconian restrictions on the right to freedom of expression, as well as increasing social media censorship (ie chilling effects). This article seeks to challenge the stringent legislative and administrative measures governments have recently put in place in order to analyse their negative implications for the right to freedom of expression and to suggest different regulatory approaches in the context of public law. These controversial government policies are discussed in order to clarify why freedom of expression cannot be allowed to be jeopardised in the process of trying to manage fake news. Firstly, an analysis of the legal definition of fake news in academia is presented in order to establish the essential characteristics of the phenomenon (Section II). Secondly, the legislative and administrative measures implemented by governments at both international (Section III) and European Union (EU) levels (Section IV) are assessed, showing how they may undermine a core human right by curtailing freedom of expression. Then, starting from the premise of social media as a watchdog of democracy and moving on to the contention that fake news is a phenomenon of mature democracy, the article argues that public law already protects freedom of expression and ensures its effectiveness at the international and EU levels through some fundamental rules (Section V). There follows a discussion of the key regulatory approaches, and, as alternatives to government intervention, self-regulation and especially empowering users are proposed as strategies to effectively manage fake news by mitigating the risks of undue interference by regulators in the right to freedom of expression (Section VI). The article concludes by offering some remarks on the proposed solution and in particular by recommending the implementation of reliability ratings on social media platforms (Section VII). © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

The new normal was assessed by endorsing practices such as vaccine passports, travel restrictions, mandatory masking, continuing contact tracing, and pursuing elimination. Results are based on five samples (N = 1,233 from April 2021 and N = 264 from January 2022) and suggest that people over-estimate COVID-19 risks to children and healthy people, as evidenced by median estimates that 5% of all global deaths were children, 29% were generally healthy people under 65, and that a healthy person under the age of 65 has 5% chance of dying from COVID-19. Over-estimates observed in this study align with those based on representative samples, and they were consistently related to stronger support for the new normal. This relationship emerged when participants estimated risks with percentages (core indicators) and indicated the extent to which risk-based statements are true/supported with evidence or false/unsupported (alternative indicators). People were notably more likely to support continuing restrictions if they believed that COVID-19 risk and risk mitigation tactics are true, even when they are not (e.g., children need to be prioritized for boosters). These relationships persisted when considering competing explanations (political ideology, statistics literacy, belief in conspiracy theories). I trace these effects to well-meaning efforts to prevent under-estimation. Public policy and people’s perceptions of risks are intertwined, where even inaccurate judgments may influence decisions. Failure to combat all misinformation with equal rigor may jeopardize the restoration of the social and economic life essential for building adaptive post-pandemic societies.

More importantly, the “accuracy” of scientific truth claims is much more difficult to define than many scholars in this space acknowledge. Uncertainties associated with the nature of science, sociopolitical climates, and media systems introduce compounding error in assessments of claim accuracy.

A quantitative, descriptive and predictive design was used and data were collected using a web-based survey from 1074 adults. Findings showed that participants had high stigmatization against COVID-19 infection. Higher empathic responding (both cognitive and affective), being a female participant, and older age resulted in higher stigmatization. Only stigmatization of COVID-19 negatively predicted individuals’ intention for testing. These findings warrant intensive efforts from the Jordanian government on a local and national level to provide ongoing public education related to several aspects of COVID-19 disease, in order to reduce or prevent the associated stigma and increase people’s intention for testing. © 2022 Shahrour et al.

Its main goal is to analyse teenagers’ critical thinking to manage scientific information in social networks. We analysed 95 ninth graders’ quality of argumentation on their degree of agreement and their degree of credibility of a fake news item. The design included a dependent variable (argumentative competence), two independent variables (degree of agreement, degree of credibility) and a covariate (reading comprehension). A significant correlation was found between the degree of agreement and the degree of credibility. In addition, the degree of credibility decreases significantly as reading comprehension increases. Students who positioned themselves against the claim of the fake news and those who did not believe it showed higher argumentative quality in their texts than those who both agreed with and believed it. These results bring evidence of the confirmation bias claim when we apply it to fake news. We tend to accept information that confirms our prior beliefs uncritically. Similarly, 83% of those who did not believe the content of the news would consult an additional text, compared to 62.5% of those who agreed with it.

Such systems, however, assume that users are impartial arbiters of truth. This assumption might be unwarranted, as users might be influenced by their own political biases and tolerance for opposing points of view, besides considering the truth value of a news item. In this paper we simulate a scenario in which users on one side of the polarity spectrum have different tolerance levels for the opinions of the other side. We create a model based on some assumptions about online news consumption, including echo chambers, selective exposure, and confirmation bias. A consequence of such a model is that news sources on the opposite side of the intolerant users attract more flags. We extend the base model in two ways: (i) by allowing news sources to find the path of least resistance that leads to a minimization of backlash, and (ii) by allowing users to change their tolerance level in response to a perceived lower tolerance from users on the other side of the spectrum. With these extensions, in the model we see that intolerance is attractive: news sources are nudged to move their polarity to the side of the intolerant users. Such a model does not support high-tolerance regimes: these regimes are out of equilibrium and will converge towards empirically-supported low-tolerance states under the assumption of partisan but rational users.

As a result, image forgery has increased such that it has become infeasible to discriminate authentic from tampered images with the naked eye. Image forgery plays a prominent role in the spread of misinformation, which might be criminalized under certain jurisdictions. Image splicing is a common type of image manipulation and constitutes one of the most widespread image tampering methods on the internet. Efforts have been made to tackle the implications of image forgery by developing computer algorithms that can discriminate tampered images, however, more research is needed to keep up with the advancements of image editing tools. Previously, we have explored fractional calculus in other image processing applications. In this study, we propose a novel pixel's fractional mean (PFM) algorithm to enhance images prior to classification for better detection of image splicing forgery based on texture features. The proposed PFM enhances each pixel separately depending on the occurrence number of the pixel's intensity. Two sets of texture algorithms are used to extract essential features from suspected spliced images. These features are then used with the “support vector machine” (SVM) classifier to classify authentic and spliced images. The proposed model demonstrated an accuracy rate of 97% when evaluated with the publicly-available image splicing dataset “CASIA v2.0”. With a relatively low dimension feature vector, the proposed model demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency, which corroborate the benefit of using fractional calculus in image processing algorithms. © 2021 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122580639"

Troublingly, much of the misinformation was couched in racialized language, particularly regarding the source of the virus and responsibility for its spread, fostering the development of related conspiracy theories. Media coverage of these conspiracy theories, particularly early on in the pandemic, had negative impacts on individuals' engagement in protective behaviors and concern with the spread of COVID-19. From extant work, racial resentment and white identity have been shown to be deeply woven into the fabric of contemporary American politics, affecting perceptions of public opinion even after accounting for social and political identities. While racial attitudes have been less studied in relation to conspiracy theory belief, we expect racial resentment and white identity to affect compliance with public health behaviors and COVID-19 conspiracy theory belief. Using observational and experimental survey data (N = 1,045), quota-sampled through Lucid Theorem (LT) in the spring of 2020, we demonstrate that framing the virus in racialized language alters endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, contingent upon levels of racial resentment and white identity and find that higher levels of conspiracy theory belief decreased compliance with preventative measures.

Interpersonal factors (e.g., high prosociality and a need to belong) and mental health risk factors (e.g., high depressive symptoms and low eudaimonic well-being) were highly associated with believing false information. Further, positive well-being was associated with assessing news with a partisan bias.

Objective: This study endeavored to elucidate COVID-19 information needs and information-seeking behaviors of cardiovascular patients hospitalized in the hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted using content analysis in 2020. The population was 17 cardiovascular patients referred to the Shahid Chamran Hospital of Isfahan, who were selected using the purposive sampling method. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed through continuous thematic analysis. Results: The findings showed four categories and ten sub-categories as follows: information needs (general information regarding COVID-19, prevention methods, and treatment methods), information resources (reliable information resources and unreliable information resources), information validation (using formal and informal resources), and information-seeking barriers (media-related, political, economical, and COVID-19-related barriers). Conclusion: Cardiovascular patients are in serious need of awareness-raising concerning COVID-19 to take care of themselves.

Using a pre-registered experiment on a diverse sample of 1079 US respondents, we find that the young, those with low information literacy, and those with high trust in government tend to hold mistaken beliefs, even without exposure to misinformation. Because these groups are already misinformed, eventual exposure to fake news does little to influence their misperceptions. Instead, misinformation exposure affects the elderly, those with high information literacy, and those with low trust in mainstream media the most.

This effect highlights one concern about the prevalence of misinformation: that exposure to it increases belief in it. To combat this, social media platforms have employed fact-checkers to label misinformation. These fact-checks are effective in reducing belief in misinformation. Some fact-checkers, however, post headlines without clear truth labels on these platforms. For example, the fact-checker Snopes posted, “Did Mark Zuckerberg Post About Orgies on Little James Island?” Posting questions that do not explicitly state that the information is false may increase belief in that information. Two experiments examined this possibility. In both experiments, exposure to questions did not increase belief.

Malicious contents in the form of fake news and hate speech are increasingly contributing to enflame online and offline tensions and violence. Focusing on September 2019 anti-foreigner violence in South Africa, this paper aims to assess the way misleading online content migrates into real-word attitudes and actions such as anti-migrant violence, reprisals, and counterviolence actions. Based data collected online and group discussions with young Africans in two African countries after the September 2019 outbreak of violence, our findings indicate a consistent positive association between exposition of young Africans across the continent to online content on violence in South Africa and their resentment against South Africans. Nevertheless, our findings could not establish a strong positive correlation between exposition to fake news and outbreak of violence. It is then not sure if messages shared on social media resort to violent offline actions. Taking the example of South Africa, our discussion assessed the propagation of deceitful content via social media, as a strategy for actors (community and political leaders) to advance ideas and social positions in the struggle for livelihood, identity, and sovereignty. The paper concludes that investing in digital media literacy could contribute to reduce the belief in online disinformation and the migration of emotions they create, into offline attitudinal and behavioural actions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144830147"

We will apply the existing theories on epistemic responsibility to the case of ignorant agents who encounter pseudoscience. We will first focus on the conditions that make their ignorance culpable, by referring to epistemic vices. Afterwards, we will explore the conditions for being excused, by analyzing the infosphere that surrounds climate change. We will argue that, in topics like climate change, there is a significant effort from interested parties in producing and disseminating hard-to-detect pseudoscience and disinformation.

We generated singleton and hybrid models to detect deception and text-based disinformation. The singleton models are trained on fraud, scams, favorable online reviews, and unfavorable online reviews. On the other hand, to generate the hybrid models we combined a disinformation train set to each of the singleton models.

By using a longitudinal design conducted with a chatbot survey among Dutch users (n = 189), this study provides first empirical evidence that helps clarify conceptual differences. First, it estimates the prevalence of these different types of news non-attendance. Second, it tests to what extend cognitive restrictions, quality assessments, and personal relevance are relevant predictors in explaining engagement in three types of non-attendance to news. Third, the study investigates how news usage behaviors (e.g., news curation, news snacking, and verification engagement) may serve as potential user-driven counter strategies against news avoidance. We find evidence for the conceptual differences. Only small shares of news non-attendance are explained by avoidance motivations. Especially news curation and verification engagement can mitigate common drivers of news avoidance, while news snacking reinforces them. © 2022 The Author(s).

The aim of study was to examine how WhatsApp users engage with the platform and the content they access through it in order to mediate through political polarization at an already divisive time.” Our results yielded three overarching themes: First, participants rarely engage in accuracy determination tactics. Second, they expressed familiarity with politically polarizing content but claimed not to engage with it. Third, they expressed intense hopes for future effective content moderation on WhatsApp. By applying cultivation theory to these insights, we examine how the app creates a reality for its users based on media socialization and the truth effect.

Those who lacked the information literacy, defined in this study as the ability to find and evaluate the reliability of information to address an information need, may have faced psychologically damaging consequences caused by the proliferation of misinformation and information poverty. Informed by an ecological understanding of human information behavior, this paper reports on the findings of a study of rural older adults’ information literacy skills and sense of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. A mail survey, based on concepts from psychology and information science and question wordings adapted from the 2021 Health and Retirement Survey and Jones-Jang et al.’s study of literacies and fake news, was distributed in the summer of 2021 to older adults living in rural Kansas. About 206 valid responses to the survey were received. These were analyzed using correlation and regression testing. The findings indicate a significant relationship between information literacy skills and one’s overall sense of well-being. Personal (age, gender, health, life control), economic (employment, finances), and social-relational resources (social engagement, relationship quality) all were shown to relate positively to information literacy skills.

We analyze how information curation is done at the institutional level and what challenges it meets. We also investigate what factors favor the cultural evolution of institutions of epistemic vigilance: these include people’s preference for accurate and reliable information and their ability to assess communicated information in view of the source’s epistemic authority; but also contingent historical factors that make it worth–or not–to contribute to the maintenance of institutions of epistemic vigilance.

RoBERTa was employed for extracting text features, and DenseNet was employed for extracting image features. The co-attention mechanism had the advantage of dynamically learning and capturing information interaction between text and image modal features. Based upon the multimodal fine-grained fake news dataset, the model of MRDCA had a higher value for all the indicators of accuracy (88.14%), macro average precision (87.16%), macro average recall (87.94%), and macro average F1 score (87.51%), comparing to unimodal approaches and other multimodal approaches through feature fusion of concatenation. More specifically, there was the unbalanced performance for MRDCA in detecting different classes of fake news. Experimental results demonstrated that the MRDCA performed better in identifying manipulated content, false connection and true than in identifying imposter content, misleading content and satire/parody. Therefore, the task of classifying samples into misleading content, imposter content and satire/parody was extremely challenging.

We note the eerie resemblance of Russian media fabrications with the Nazis’ big lie technique. The enormous toll of the war on Ukraine and the world is clearly stated. The war in Ukraine and the battle over the accuracy and legitimacy of history, knowledge and reality remind us of the crucial importance of teaching critical thinking. Critical thinking helps us see through manipulative and politically distortive usages of language to suit ideological purposes. In using the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to teach critical thinking, we can follow a generic model of gradual sequencing that prominently features modelling and scaffolding. In an era of weaponised lies and alternative facts, critical thinking has a central role in education, from kindergarten to university, with the purpose of education being the creation of an informed citizenry. Although critical thinking – and teaching critical thinking – are challenging, it is when both teachers and students realise their own responsibilities for creating a learning community that learning is at its most useful and critical thinking becomes empowering. © 2022, Kaplan Singapore.

Much research seeks to understand such errors. They provide the basic scientist with windows into understanding how memory works and have implications in a myriad of real-world domains including but not limited to eyewitness testimony, advertising, education, and the proliferation of political misinformation (Schacter, 2022b; see also Baddeley et al., 2002; Dunlosky et al., 2013; Loftus, 1979). In an effort to gain traction on such errors, the review by Schacter (2022a) builds on prior work (Schacter, 1999, 2022a, 2022b) that classifies memory errors into the seven sins of memory: the sins of commission include misattribution (incorrectly remembering the source of a memory), bias (knowledge or beliefs shaping memory of the past), suggestibility (misleading suggestions leading to memory errors or false memories), and persistence (the retrieval of aversive memories), aswell as the sins of omission such as transience (forgetting information over time), absentmindedness (lack of attention leading to forgetting), and blocking (failure to retrieve information stored in memory). This taxonomy serves several important functions: it emphasizes that there is more than one kind of memory error and highlights errors’ similarities and differences; it offers a convenient way of talking about memory errors (for both scientists and the general public); it also coins catchy labels that attract attention to the science of memory errors. While taxonomies are powerful because they simplify, this should not be at the cost of understanding the complex cognitive processes that underlie these memory sins. Therefore, 2 decades after the original publication of the “Seven Sins of Memory” (Schacter, 1999), we believe this taxonomy should more explicitly reflect two things, neither of which we think is particularly controversial: first, that many memory errors reflect a confluence of sins, and second, that it is time to more enthusiastically embrace a “cup half-full” approach, emphasizing the adaptive nature of memory © 2022 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147710419"

Our evidence makes clear that corrections eliminate the effects of misinformation on beliefs about the vaccine, but that neither misinformation nor corrections affect vaccination intention. These effects are robust to formatting changes in the presentation of the corrections. Indeed, corrections without any formatting modifications whatsoever prove effective at reducing false beliefs, with formatting variations playing a very minor role.

Using quantitative methods, the researchers found CML as the primary factor underlying the survey data and a strong awareness of the importance of teaching CML to students.

In response to this threat, the Malaysian government launched public service announcements (PSAs) on COVID-19 in various media to increase public awareness and knowledge, specifically on recommended solutions. The messages in the PSAs were tailored to underscore the various phases of the pandemic to persuade public belief as well as nurture positive attitude and behavioural changes. The objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate the public’s information-seeking behaviours, (2) to investigate user perceptions and indicators of PSAs, and (3) to determine the effectiveness of PSAs as a communication platform to convey important information about the pandemic throughout the different Movement Control Order (MCO) phases. Through focus group discussions with eight urban Klang Valley informants, findings highlight the crucial elements in identifying motivation and factors of media preferences which affect how various media platforms benefit the Malaysian public.

As seemingly ordinary and trustworthy individuals, who can function as opinion leaders, influencers may impact perceptions of the virus and policies in place to minimize its threat. In this pre-registered online experiment (N = 148), we investigated factors such as parasocial relationships with the influencer, which potentially increase susceptibility to influencers’ claims. Second, we examined if media literacy and issue-specific knowledge act as protective factors diminishing the impact of misinformation. Although participants remained largely unaffected by the misinformation, it increased mistrust in official sources for respondents with high perceived influencer credibility, trust in influencer’s advice, and attitude homophily. Meanwhile, participants’ issue-specific knowledge was associated with weaker beliefs in misconceptions regarding COVID-19, irrespective of exposure to misinformation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131524910"

This study conducted an experiment (N = 230) that tested (1) how a news article using deepfake video (vs. real video) affects news credibility and viral behavioral intentions and (2) whether, based on signaling theory, obtaining knowledge about the low cost of producing deepfakes reduces the impact of deepfake news. Results show that people whose pre-existing attitudes toward controversial issues (abortion, marijuana legalization) are congruent with the advocated position of a news article are more likely to believe and be willing to share deepfake news as much as real video news. In addition, educating participants about the low cost of producing deepfakes was effective in reducing the credibility and viral behavioral intention of deepfake news for those who have congruent issue attitudes. This study provides evidence for differing levels of susceptibility for deepfake news and the importance of media literacy education regarding deepfakes that would prevent biased reasoning. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128598346"

Netizens constantly questioned the authorities’ messaging for inconsistencies in official narratives, which led to the dissemination of what came to called fake news that just happened to occasionally to be true. COVID skepticism affected countries around the world including Thailand, where social media users were regularly suspicious of the government narratives presented to the general public. The question arose of how people can factcheck official messaging that appears to be questionable, and the subject remains an issue more than 2 years later: Who should be the ultimate arbiter of truth in the COVID debate, and when does one turn to this arbiter? This paper follows Thailand social media discourse in an examination of discursive frames with the aim of identifying the correlations between public approval of Thai government disease control efforts and public skepticism of the official messages. The analysis demonstrates that the Thai public was generally accepting of the government’s messaging as long as the government’s efforts generally appeared to be successful but that public skepticism increased as approval of government actions decreased. Netizens in Thailand turned to Western sources of information such as the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control in searches for accurate information. This example of the Thai public’s COVID-19 discourse during the pandemic illustrates how credibility can be a function of approval rather than of truthfulness and transparency. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138007368"

While social media is viewed as a critical tool for the public to obtain information about COVID-19, there is also a need to examine how information is shared and distributed by the public. With the Internet, misinformation can be easily shared by many people, particularly during a pandemic. To combat fake news, it is critical to understand the level of knowledge and media literacy among Malaysian youth, who account for the majority of Internet users. In this research, we explore the experience and social media literacy skills among youths aged 18–34 years old and their ability to refute fake news about COVID-19. To achieve these objectives, in-depth interviews with 10 social media users who are active in seeking and sharing information or news related to COVID-19 was conducted using an online platform and phone calls. This paper argues that despite the high risk of encountering fake news on social media, youths in this study perceived social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook as an important tool of information for COVID-19. They also believed fake news can be combated by having important media literacy skills, especially when verifying news. Our findings show that most of the participants chose to cross-check the information related to COVID-19 by referring to reliable and official sources such as the National Safety Council (NSC), the Ministry of Health’s sebenarnya.my portal, and well-established news outlets like Astro Awani. The findings of this study are significant as they shed light on how youths perceive social media literacy and fake news, as well as the social media literacy skills used to combat fake news during the COVID-19 pandemic. © SEARCH Journal 2022.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138222891"

Few studies have explored perceptions of control over different causes of death and there is a lack of qualitative risk research. Our aim was to examine participants’ perceptions of control over potential causes of death and the sources that inform perceptions of risk. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 participants (14 female and 10 male) and conducted a template analysis to analyse the transcripts. Findings: We identified six themes to represent participants’ perceptions of control over potential mortality risks and the sources that inform these perceptions: Health-Related Mortality Risks, External Causes of Risk, Finding Balance, Family Medical History, Online Sources of Risk and Health-Related Information, and Health Misinformation. Dying from heart disease was broadly reported as being a controllable risk, whereas cancer was mostly discussed as uncontrollable. Gender-specific cancers were perceived as posing a significant risk to life, however controlling this risk was discussed in terms of screening and treatment, not prevention. Family medical history was discussed as an informative source for longevity predictions, but less so for specific causes of death. Most risk information is retrieved from ‘Dr Google’, though trusted sources, such as NHS websites, are used for validation. Health misinformation online was seen as a problem experienced by other people, rather than the individual. Conclusions: Causal pathways between behaviours and specific cancers may not be obvious to individuals. Messages emphasising the broader links between diet, alcohol and general cancer risk may highlight the controllability of cancer risk through improved health behaviours. Furthermore, given the rise in health misinformation, and the belief that it is other people not ourselves that are typically susceptible to believing misinformation online, further attempts are needed to combat this growing ‘infodemic’. © 2022 The Author(s).

If users do not primarily repost to transmit accurate information, what other purpose does this activity serve? This article contributes to the theorization of news sharing by exploring seven affordances enabled by social media’s reposting features, namely visibility, scalability, persistence, association, meta-voicing, interactivity, and immediacy. Taken together, beyond facilitating the spreading of information, these affordances render reposting an effective means for self-presentation similar to Harry Frankfurt’s notion of bullshit. Like bullshitters, reposters are principally concerned with presenting an image of themselves. However, unlike bullshitters, reposters can be deterred by a post’s inaccuracy. Still, because the social media context draws users’ attention to interpersonal connections, accuracy is often not top of mind when making reposting choices. Thus, as platforms no longer serve only social objectives but have also become integral news sources, what is being communicated primarily for self-presentation purposes may inadvertently be perceived for its informational value. Ultimately, this functional context collapse contributes to the (unintended) spreading of misinformation through individual reposting. © 2022 (Jueni Duyen Tran).

In this paper, we introduce a new contemporary Reddit dataset for fake news spreader analysis, called FACTOID, monitoring political discussions on Reddit since the beginning of 2020. The dataset contains over 4K users with 3.4M Reddit posts, and includes, beyond the users' binary labels, also their fine-grained credibility level (very low to very high) and their political bias strength (extreme right to extreme left). As far as we are aware, this is the first fake news spreader dataset that simultaneously captures both the long-term context of users' historical posts and the interactions between them. To create the first benchmark on our data, we provide methods for identifying misinformation spreaders by utilizing the social connections between the users along with their psycho-linguistic features.

Evidently, health misinformation related to vaccinations has slowed down global efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have shown that fake news spreads substantially faster than real news on social media networks. One way to limit this fast dissemination is by assessing information sources in a semi-automatic way. To this end, we aim to identify users who are prone to spread fake news in Arabic Twitter. Such users play an important role in spreading misinformation and identifying them has the potential to control the spread. We construct an Arabic dataset on Twitter users, which consists of 1,546 users, of which 541 are prone to spread fake news (based on our definition). We use features extracted from users’ recent tweets, e.g., linguistic, statistical, and profile features, to predict whether they are prone to spread fake news or not. To tackle the classification task, multiple learning models are employed and evaluated. Empirical results reveal promising detection performance, where an F1 score of 0.73 was achieved by the logistic regression model. Moreover, when tested on a benchmark English dataset, our approach has outperformed the current state-of-the-art for this task. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA).","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145874313"

We find that polarized supporters of President Duterte are more likely to inaccurately identify fake and real news, compared to polarized supporters of the opposition. This is remarkably similar to trends in the United States where Republicans are more vulnerable to misinformation.

Therefore, the world of the internet has become a very hard place to be able to figure out what information available is factual or not. Recently aggressors of this have been sources publishing articles as real news to sway people to behave a certain way. By training a program to identify what is the difference between a factual piece of writing and the nonfactual, consumers would be able to better navigate the political, spiritual, and physical world around them better informed than they otherwise might have been. In this research, the experiment takes a piece of writing and decodes what words were used and compares its previous learning to find out if the words used lead, it to know that something is nonfactual. It then comes up with a percentage based on that and other smaller details like punctuation to determine the result of the report detailing its factuality percentage based on the machine's findings. The purpose of this research is to help people have a better knowledge of which news sources are the most reliable to be able to make smarter decisions on what to believe in this era of misinformation.

Despite various fact-checking websites such as PolitiFact, robust detection techniques are required to deal with the increase in fake news. Several deep learning models show promising results for fake news classification, however, their black-box nature makes it difficult to explain their classification decisions and quality-assure the models. We here address this problem by proposing a novel interpretable fake news detection framework based on the recently introduced Tsetlin Machine (TM). In brief, we utilize the conjunctive clauses of the TM to capture lexical and semantic properties of both true and fake news text. Further, we use clause ensembles to calculate the credibility of fake news. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets, PolitiFact and GossipCop, and demonstrate that the TM framework significantly outperforms previously published baselines by at least 5% in terms of accuracy, with the added benefit of an interpretable logic-based representation. In addition, our approach provides a higher F1-score than BERT and XLNet, however, we obtain slightly lower accuracy. We finally present a case study on our model's explainability, demonstrating how it decomposes into meaningful words and their negations. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144390639"

Our study examines a factor with a long history in the study of public opinion: the importance a person attaches to an issue. The subjective state of issue importance has complex effects. It can increase an individual’s motivation to engage in effortful information processing while also leading them to defend existing beliefs and opinions. In a series of experiments administered in national surveys, we examine whether issue importance is implicated in the failure to correct false beliefs. The analyses show that on the topic of GM foods, the effects of a corrective message are smallest among misinformed people who rated the issue as personally important. By contrast, framing GM foods in terms of partisan identity engendered little resistance to a corrective message. Our findings illustrate the value of adopting a broader perspective on misinformation because people may resist corrections for reasons that are unrelated to their partisanship. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139190209"

This study exposes for the first time a unique form of “epistemic subsidies,” suggesting a new explanation for PR-journalists’ paradoxical relations. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative reconstructions, in which Israeli news reporters from national news outlets accounted for the sources they used (N = 1,147), this paper reaffirms the persistence of the paradox, while shedding new light on it, showing that the relationship is based on reliability rather than trust. Information from PR sources is communicated to journalists in a significantly more reliable way than from non-PR–making reliance much safer. Analyzing the findings with a framework that is based on social epistemology and the intereffication theory, the paper suggests that the epistemically-virtues practices of PR act as “inductions,” which could result from an “adaptation” to journalists’ increasing epistemic needs. Findings also reopen the normative debate about the implication of reliance on PR, indicating that such reliance reduces vulnerability to factually incorrect messages, while not defending journalists from misleading messages or “spins.”. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131951003"

Four hundred thirty five U.S. participants recruited from mTurk were texted true and false trivia statements across 15 days before rating the accuracy of each statement.

Through a two-by-two survey experiment among 267 Twitter users, we found evidence to support these hypotheses. We additionally found that the effectiveness of strong ties and celebrities as retweeters varied by users’ perceptions of their attributes and users’ interactions with them.

The new 88-million word corpus Language of Conspiracy (LOCO) was created with the intention to provide a text collection to study how the language of conspiracy differs from mainstream language. We use this corpus to develop a robust annotation scheme that will allow us to distinguish between documents containing conspiracy language and documents that do not contain any conspiracy content or that propagate conspiracy theories via misinformation (which we explicitly disregard in our work). We find that focusing on indicators of a belief in a conspiracy combined with textual cues of conspiracy language allows us to reach a substantial agreement (based on Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's alpha). We also find that the automatic retrieval methods used to collect the corpus work well in finding mainstream documents, but include some documents in the conspiracy category that would not belong there based on our definition. © 2022 European Language Resources Association (ELRA).","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146040145"

However, there is little evidence about the relative efficacy of these approaches in this unique context of a pandemic. Using a pair of survey experiments, we examine whether false tags and journalistic factchecks reduce accuracy misperceptions and sharing propensity on social media that can spread false claims. False tags had little effect on subjects' accuracy assessments and social media sharing. Journalistic factchecks that offer accurate information to counter misinformation were more effective in reducing both misperceptions and sharing on social media. Further, we find no evidence of partisan backfire effects, even in response to interventions against claims with a plausible partisan valence. Our results suggest that journalistic factchecks provide an effective counternarrative to COVID-19 misinformation even in the context of the increasing politicization of America's pandemic response and polarization more generally.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

However, the support that queer ethnic young people receive from family and community is compromised by homophobic attitudes and behaviors influenced by misinformation, religious beliefs, and cultural practices. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the absence of research on young ethnic queers suggests that little is known about how this group fares in a close and culturally bound ethnic community within a predominantly white society. This in-depth qualitative study of 43 queer ethnic young people examined how community attitudes and behaviors toward queerness impacted their family and community relationships. Gossip, rumors, silence, stigma, and respectability politics resulted in gender silencing and monitoring, rejection, and self-exclusion. These behaviors exacerbated feelings of cultural alienation in a society where ethnic peoples are already racialized and minoritized, and where the lack of support systems compound an unsafe environment for queer ethnic young people. Homonegative attitudes within ethnic communities require education and interventions at the interpersonal as well as communal level. Families need professional support to address their shame toward children’s queerness and to consider the impact of prioritizing the politics of respectability over the wellbeing of their child. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133656578"

Accurate information has also fallen victim to the pandemic, which has been rife with misinformation and conspiracy theories. The current study investigated Covid-19 deceptions related to employment. With complete anonymity via MTurk, 389 participants from the United States rated their likelihood of deception regarding hypothetical four workplace scenarios. The first set of analyses examined differences between high and low risk of deceptions for each scenario based on participants’ self-appraisals. The largest differences were found for general conspiracy beliefs and affective disorders, specifically major depression and generalized anxiety. The second set of analyses focused across the workplace scenarios on two operationalized groups with Likely-Deceptive (n = 189) vastly outnumbering Likely-Genuine (n = 55). Personal experiences with Covid-19 dramatically increased deceptions. Testing positive for Covid-19 increased the odds of being in the Likely-Deceptive by twelve-fold. Two discriminant models examined cognitive misbeliefs and psychological functioning. When both were combined, depression and Covid-19 misinformation produced the strongest structure coefficients followed closely by general conspiracy beliefs and generalized anxiety.

Based on a repeated measures experiment (N = 668), we show that individuals who endorse post-truth epistemic beliefs distinguish less between fake news and accurate news (fake news discernment). Further, D was linked to reduced fake news discernment, which is explained by a positive relationship with post-truth epistemic beliefs.

The three phenomena of filtering, hypernudging, and microtargeting can have the effect of polarizing an electorate and thus undermine the deliberative potential of a democratic society. Algorithms can spread fake news throughout the society, undermining the epistemic potential that broad participation in democracy is meant to offer. They can pose a threat to political equality in that some people may have the means to make use of algorithmic communications and the sophistication to be immune from attempts at manipulation, while other people are vulnerable to manipulation by those who use these means. My concern here is with the danger that algorithmic communications can pose to political equality, which arises because most citizens must make decisions about what and who to support in democratic politics with only a sparse budget of time, money, and energy. Algorithmic communications such as hypernudging and microtargeting can be a threat to democratic participation when persons are operating in environments that do not conduce to political sophistication. This constitutes a deepening of political inequality.

Recent analyses have characterized such disputes as Bolsonaro’s “ideological battle” against “rational arguments” of specialists and the WHO. Also, critics have described Bolsonaro as a representative of “scientific populism” who produces fake news to support his anti-science politics. In this article, we engage with the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to observe the multiple uses of science during the pandemic. We argue that Bolsonaro does not deny scientific statements in toto but seeks to legitimize his government’s health politics based upon public controversies about science. Bolsonaro explores the interstices of the making of scientific facts to question WHO’s credibility and to accuse his adversaries of politicizing scientific research during the pandemic. Thus, Bolsonaro sustains a transcendental image of science, which reifies the modern separation between science knowledge and culture, to criticize the ideological contamination of certain institutions. This posture reveals the epistemic dispute intrinsic to contemporary debates on post-truth, which postulates that ideology, esoterism, and anti-reason are always attributes of others. © 2022, Sociologias.

Concurrently, conspiracy beliefs regarding the origin and spread of the disease have become widespread. Engaging in such beliefs can be explained as a form of coping in order to deal with elevated levels of stress. The present study investigated the indirect effects of coping strategies in the association between perceived chronic stress and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs. We report data from an online survey (N = 1,354 individuals: 807 female; 508 male; 8 diverse; 6 not specified; mean age 39.14 years) in German-speaking countries collected between January and March 2021. Our results indicate that people who felt more stressed were more prone to conspiracy beliefs. Coping via acceptance and self-blame was associated with decreased tendencies towards COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, while people who used denial as a strategy were more prone to these beliefs. These findings emphasize the need for stress management interventions and effective coping strategies during times of crisis in order to reduce chronic perceived stress, promote adaptive coping, and ultimately reduce conspiracy beliefs. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136183138"

Memory operates in an extremely efficient manner, allowing us to recall more pleasant than unpleasant memories and enough detail to reconstruct past experiences with reasonable accuracy. Memory is, however, subject to distortion, the study of which has historically been rooted in interference theory. Interference theory states that the reason we forget is that other memories in long-term memory impair our ability to retrieve the target memory. Memory involves a reconstructive process: It is vulnerable to interference from other experiences, especially from experiences that occur after a to-be-remembered event. This new edition offers updated findings regarding the many factors that can inflate the impact of post-event information, as well as novel findings on the neuroscience behind the reconstructive nature of memory. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Rüdiger F.

In two online studies with 15,016 participants, we present authentic videos and deepfakes and ask participants to identify which is which. We compare the performance of ordinary human observers with the leading computer vision deepfake detection model and find them similarly accurate, while making different kinds of mistakes. Together, participants with access to the model’s prediction are more accurate than either alone, but inaccurate model predictions often decrease participants’ accuracy. To probe the relative strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines as detectors of deepfakes, we examine human and machine performance across video-level features, and we evaluate the impact of preregistered randomized interventions on deepfake detection. We find that manipulations designed to disrupt visual processing of faces hinder human participants’ performance while mostly not affecting the model’s performance, suggesting a role for specialized cognitive capacities in explaining human deepfake detection performance. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

The prevalence of misinformation on the internet makes the search for accurate online health information a more complex and evaluative process. This study examined the role of age and neurocognition in credibility evaluations of credible and non-credible health websites. Forty-one older adults and fifty younger adults completed a structured credibility rating task in which they evaluated a series of webpages displaying health information about migraine treatments. Participants also completed measures of neurocognition, internet use, and health literacy. Results suggested that older adults rated non-credible health websites as more credible than younger adults, but the age groups did not differ in their ratings of credible sites. Within the full sample, neurocognition was associated with credibility ratings for non-credible health websites, whereas health literacy was related to the ratings of credible sites. Findings indicate that older adults may be more likely to trust non-credible health websites than younger adults, which may be related to differences in higher-order neurocognitive functions. Future work might examine whether cognitive-based supports for credibility training in older adults can be used to improve the accuracy with which they evaluate online health information. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134577118"

The author addresses the toxic environment created by social media, a primary source of misinformation and fearmongering which leads to growing resistance and polarization among some church leaders and faithful. The resistance to accepting Pope Francis's remarkable ecclesial vision for some sectors of the Church revolves around a harmful reaction which Pope St. John Paul II called ecclesial introversion. The unfamiliarity and even strangeness of his Latin American and Jesuit roots and to the legacy of Medellin and the subsequent CELAM gatherings at least partially explain the challenge Francis's bold reforms present fo the global Church. © 2022 Faculdade Jesuita de Filosofia e Teologia.

Some mothers were instructed to focus on eliciting an accurate account, whereas others were told to talk naturally as in everyday life. Before this conversation, some mothers in each goal condition were exposed to misleading information about what their children experienced. Mothers focused on accuracy exhibited more bias in their conversations than those centered on talking naturally.

However, right‐wing actors also engage in protest. Are right‐wing actors mobilized by the same factors as those actors on the left? This article uses cross‐national survey data (i.e., US, UK, France, and Canada) gathered in February 2021 to assess the role of misinformation, conspiracy beliefs, and the use of different social media platforms in explaining participation in marches or demonstrations. We find that those who use Twitch or TikTok are twice as likely to participate in marches or demonstrations, compared to non‐users, but the uses of these platforms are more highly related to participation in right‐wing protests than left‐wing protests. Exposure to misinformation on social media and beliefs in conspiracy theories also increase the likelihood of participating in protests. Our research makes several important contributions. First, we separate right‐wing protest participation from left‐wing protest participation, whereas existing scholarship tends to lump these together. Second, we offer new insights into the effects of conspiracy beliefs and misinformation on participation using cross‐national data. Third, we examine the roles of emerging social media platforms such as Twitch and TikTok (as well as legacy platforms such as YouTube and Facebook) to better understand the differential roles that social media platforms play in protest participation. © 2022 by the author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140623057"

Design/methodology/approach: A Google Form developed questionnaire, distributed conveniently through link shared through WhatsApp groups was used to collect data from frontline workers from Dar es Salaam and Dodoma cities. Analysis was done using a binary regression analysis. Findings: It was found that it was not the source that mattered for one to be hesitancy or not on COVID-19 vaccination, but the extent to which the information the source channels was manipulated or false. Research limitations/implications: Relying only Google Form questionnaire sent through a link on WhatsApp may have compromised the quality of information gathered and the quality of conclusion. Another study may have conducted through researcher administered questionnaire to a bigger sample to increase conclusion reliability and validity. Practical implications: This study urges that to increase the COVID-19 vaccine uptake, it is important to ensure that the quality of information from the revealed dependable sources is checked to avoid possible consequential disquiet resulting from misinformation.

Like any persuasive communication, fact checkers depend on their recipients perceiving both their messages and them as credible (Lombardi, Seyranian, and Sinatra 2014; Lombardi, Nussbaum, and Sinatra 2016). This study investigates the role of the perceived credibility of the fact checker as possible detriment to the effectiveness of fact-checking efforts by means of an online survey-embedded experiment. Results show that the perceived credibility of the fact checker and fact-checking messages is best explained by normative expectations of the roles of fact checkers and trust in traditional media. Some users perceive fact checkers as elite power structures in journalism or, in other words, as collaborative-facilitators for state propaganda (Hanitzsch and Vos 2018; see also Fawzi 2020). Further, low trust in media and politics predicts perceived credibility of disinformation better than political partisanship. The findings suggest that fact checkers should be more transparent and proactive in communicating their motives and identities.

The current digital context is helping to exacerbate these problems, which represent the two main threats to the public's right to be informed in a constitutional democracy. The current legal-constitutional frameworks to protect the public’s right to information across EU jurisdictions are no longer effective in guaranteeing two elements associated with this fundamental right: the independence of the media and the duty of truthfulness of journalists. As a solution to this problem, a system of transparency of media companies to reinforce these two elements may become a complementary tool to effectively guarantee the right to information. In this context, a number of voluntary transparency systems of news media organizations are emerging in the European Union and the United States to strengthen media independence and editorial credibility. In this article I first describe and compare these systems by using criteria associated with effective transparency policies. Then I identify standards that are common to all the initiatives focusing on news governance and I evaluate how these standards are being already implemented by a sample of five Anglo American media brands that are enjoying the credibility of their users evidenced by the increasing levels of subscription rates. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150342785"

A content analysis was conducted on 2189 comments derived from 45 fake news on Facebook between 2017 to 2019, Chi-Square Test was subsequently performed to analyze the association between the variables. The findings showed that there is an association between belief and emotion towards fake news - fake news non-believers tend to show negative emotion when they read fake news and commenters with negative emotion are more likely to claim that the news is fake compared to their counterpart. However, negative emotion is not significantly associated with proving the news is fake.

The crisis of truth refers to an era where evidence and objective facts get lost in sentiment, emotion, and personal beliefs. Relying on emotions, creationism, religious beliefs, and common sense over expertise deliberately creates counter-knowledge referred to as pseudo-science, troll-science or fake-science. As the worth of scientific expertise is devalued, the counter-scientific discourses supported through populist political rhetoric help to produce a culture of resistance to science. Our qualitative content analysis of Twitter posts along with the news regarding anti-vaccine arguments from two selected online news sites, revealed three major themes, which we referred to as strategies used by the COVID-19 vaccine deniers in Turkey to disseminate their views. These were: an emphasis on bodily freedom and personal choice and the use of “my body my choice” rhetoric; the denying, devaluing, and shifting of scientific evidence; and the dismissal and/or attacking of alternative views and the deepening of the polarisation between the supporters of the COVID-19 restrictions, vaccine supporters and deniers. We conclude the paper by arguing that there is a link between the distrust of doctors and the anti-vaccination ideas, and the quest for alternative knowledge and expert authority. © 2022 The Author(s).

Understanding the origins of neuromyths is important, because the source of beliefs may impact not only their strength, but also educators’ abilities to correct them. We investigated whether having a specific memory of learning a neuromyth would relate to strength of belief in the myth. Among a nonuniversity participant pool sample, there was no relationship between remembering the myth’s source and strength of belief. However, in a college student sample, remembering the source of the myth was frequently associated with stronger belief than simply “knowing” the information to be true. K–12 teachers, common sense, and college professors were the most frequently reported sources of neuromyths. Having taken more psychology or neuroscience courses was not related to accuracy of beliefs about brain function in either sample.

Method: Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: a control condition (no training); a passive inoculation condition; or an active inoculation condition. Participants completed demographic questions followed by training or no training and then evaluated a misinformation and factual article for reliability and persuasiveness. Results: Participants in the active inoculation condition rated the reliability and persuasiveness of the misinformation article and the reliability of the factual article lower than participants in the control condition. Participants in the passive inoculation training did not rate the reliability and persuasiveness of a misinformation and factual article significantly differently to those in the control condition. When factors such as ideological worldview and climate change beliefs were controlled for however, the inoculation interventions had no significant effect on ratings of reliability and persuasiveness for a misinformation or factual article. Conclusion: Inoculation seems to be a promising method of preventing the acceptance of misinformation on climate science.

Several of the most methodologically sound studies find small to nonexistent effects. However, extant research is limited by focusing on few platforms (usually Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) and is heavily U.S. centered. This leaves open the possibility that other platforms, such as those that rely on visual communication (e.g., Instagram) or are tailored to strong-tie network communication (e.g., WhatsApp), are more influential. Furthermore, the few studies conducted in other countries suggest that social media use increases political misperceptions. Still, these works use cross-sectional designs, which are ill suited to dealing with omitted variable bias and temporal ordering of processes. Using a two-wave survey fielded in Mexico during the 2021 midterm elections (N = 596), we estimate the relationship between frequency of news exposure on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp, and belief in political misinformation, while controlling for both time-invariant and time-dependent individual differences. In contrast to political discussion, information literacy and digital skills, none of the social platforms analyzed exhibits a significant association with misinformed beliefs. We also tested for possible indirect, moderated, and reciprocal relationships, but none of these analyses yielded a statistically significant result. We conclude that the study is consistent with the “minimal media effects” paradigm, which suggests that efforts to address misinformation need to go beyond social platforms. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127303133"

The problem of fake news becomes especially prominent during periods of social exacerbation, such as the coronavirus pandemic, wherein the events have a significant impact on many lives. Generational differences are considered as a factor affecting perceptions of the reliability of news. Objective. The aim of this study was to reveal and compare the social representations of information reliability and news verification criteria among people belonging to the Generation of Reforms (born 1968-1981), the Millennial Generation (1982-2000) and Generation Z (2001 and later) in Russia. Design. The study involved 431 participants and was comprised of two stages: focus groups and a survey. The data analysis methods employed were thematic analysis, qualitative and quantitative content analysis, coefficient of positive answers (according to J. Abric), Kruskal-Wallis H test, Pearson's chi-square test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and Kendall's t-rank correlation coefficient. Results. We have found significant differences between the Generation of Reforms (CPA: 80,5; p = 0,000) and Generation Z (CPA: 90,2; p = 0,000), and similarities between the Millennial Generation (CPA: 90,3; p = 0,000) and Generation Z, in the structure and content of social representations regarding “fakes”. Notably, Generation Z favors a fact-checking strategy to identify news reliability, while “Reformists” rely on offline contacts. Conclusion. Generations in Russia differ with respect to their tolerance of “fakes” and their strategies for news verification. The results advance our understanding of “fakes” as purely social constructs. The attribution of media incompetence to older and younger cohorts by each other was discussed as the generational conflict. © 2022. Lomonosov Moscow State University.

As technology progresses, it becomes easier for everyone to access social media, to the point where some news organisations seek to exploit it as a news source. Meanwhile, in order to avoid public panic, it is critical to educate society at a young age about the impact of fake news on social media. The purpose of this study is to explain the purpose of social media usage and to investigate whether the use of social media platforms to disseminate information has increased the spread of fake news in Malaysia, as well as the effect of information disseminated among university students during the COVID pandemic. Social media is well-known for its ease of use, particularly among young people, in sharing and expressing their opinions on domestic and international topics. Using social media has become second nature to us, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the strength of social media, the public's opinion of finding information during a lockdown is quite positive. The study was carried out in a qualitative manner. The researcher gathered all of the data by asking the participants general research questions. The method employed to obtain the results was an in-depth interview. The findings revealed that information disseminated via social media was successful in raising awareness during the pandemic, particularly among university students. According to the findings, certain scientific and technical advancements should benefit the global community rather than be manipulated in order to obtain accurate and true knowledge; society must be astute. False knowledge would have negative repercussions, and society would inevitably exist in a state of deception.

The texts were tagged using the UCREL Semantic Annotation System (USAS) (Rayson, 2008) to facilitate the investigation of emergent and decreasing semantic trends over the period; the strength of trends was empirically evaluated through application of Kendall’s Tau correlation coefficient. The analysis revealed that domains reflecting truth evaluations and matters of credibility increased alongside a more people-orientated discourse, as evidenced by increases in personal pronouns. Furthermore, instances invoking warfare and defence decreased, paralleled by a decrease in the representations of toughness. These results may reflect a shift in US political discourse generally, and American presidential discourse specifically, while also reflecting evolving contemporary social and political interests over the twenty-year span of the corpus. This study concludes with interpretations of these discursive shifts in the context of the current era of so-called ‘fake news’, intense partisanship, and social and political divisiveness. Findings indicate that the current US political climate cannot simply be attributed to an anomalous Trump administration but, rather, the discursive features contributing to and reflecting the current political environment have been present and increasing since at least the year 2000 election cycle. © Edinburgh University Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144303815"

The research in the area of methodology development, tool design, implementation of the adopted assumptions, and report preparation was carried out by the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw (PPA-polish state news agency) and the authors. The result of the survey is 316 questionnaires completed by journalists. During analyses, CATI research was used. The presented results are representative of the journalistic community and allow for extrapolation to the entire population of journalists and media workers in Poland. It was found that the importance of information and its consumption had increased. The situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the work of Polish journalists publishing their content on social media, which results directly from the significant changes that have affected this medium. An increase in the speed of its spread was also observed. These factors negatively affect the quality of information and its credibility, resulting in fake news.

After the COVID-19 outbreak, the overabundance of fake information and rumours on online social platforms about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread over society as quickly as the virus itself. As a result, fake news poses a significant threat to effective virus response by negatively affecting people’s willingness to follow the proper public health guidelines and protocols, which makes it important to identify fake information from online platforms for the public interest. In this research, we introduce an approach to detect fake news using deep learning techniques, which outperform traditional machine learning techniques with a 93.1% accuracy. We then investigate the content differences between real and fake news by applying topic modeling and linguistic analysis. Our results show that topics on Politics and Government services are most common in fake news. In addition, we found that fake news has lower analytic and authenticity scores than real news. With the findings, we discuss important academic and practical implications of the study. © 2022,Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems.All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147749479"

The main normative concern is that the diffusion of false political news might lead to distorted perceptions of the social and political reality. Indeed, existing research largely focuses on the determinants of public misinformation and the spread of false news. However, the mere awareness of the diffusion of fake news might have important implications, by reducing the public trust in the information environment. This study aims at explaining the contextual variation in citizens’ perceived exposure to false information and their concerns for the impact of false information on society and democracy. We focus on two properties of the context: party polarization, as a proxy for the degree of political conflict, and media accuracy. We provide empirical evidence for our claims using a mix of data from Eurobarometer, the European Election Studies, the European Media System Survey, and Freedom House. We find that polarization and media accuracy are not related to the citizens’ self-assessed exposure to false information, but they are significantly associated with their concerns. We also find that citizens’ perceived exposure to false news is better explained by the degree of media freedom in the country. © 2022 SAGE Publications.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136702336"

Researchers conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with urban youth in Ethiopia's East-Gojjam district. The findings revealed three major stages in the youth's risk perception: the high perceived risk stage associated with early pandemic outbreaks, the steady decline stage associated with economic stress that outweighed perceived health risk, and the zero risk stage when all safety measures appear to have been completely abandoned. The government's self-contradictory rhetoric and practice, the contradiction between religious teachings and scientific messages, and misinformation in social media are factors for the evolved risk beliefs. A major lesson from the global south is the active participation of key stakeholders in bridging the gap between government and society.  © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2022.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145999864"

Essentialism is the implicit belief that categories of people–those of certain ethnicities or nationalities, for example–have intrinsic, immutable properties, driven by some deep, unobservable, and often deterministic causal essence. There is robust evidence that cross-culturally, both young children and adults sometimes employ an essentialist heuristic when reasoning about cultural traits, and that they see others’ traits as being less mutable than their own. Strikingly, though, cultures vary drastically in the particulars and extent of this cultural essentialism. Thus, it seems clear that cultural input can to some degree either exploit or overwrite a tendency toward cultural essentialism, with language being an especially powerful mechanism. In this paper, I demonstrate ways that language is intentionally used by those with political power to promote essentialist thought and to justify violence. In particular, I highlight use of generic language, ascriptive definitions, and the language of opposites within propaganda. I end with consideration of ways to be responsive to instances of propaganda within our own communities and as global citizens, such as through pro-social repurposing of the linguistic tools that have been used destructively, promoting nuance through the use of differentiated language, and by capitalizing on an intuitive human belief in essential goodness and desire for truth. © Isacoff, Nora M., 2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148242882"

Viral disinformation disseminated in 2020-2021 was related to a wide range of topics that caused panic among people. Many false narratives emerged and attracted public interest over time, which mainly reflected the general public's utmost belief in these topics. Text mining can be used to analyze the frequencies of keywords and topic-related vocabulary in order to track the changing focus of the public concerning online disinformation. In this paper, we present the results of a corpus-based study of Russian viral fake stories circulating during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. We propose a method for analyzing the central topics and dynamics of topical change in the context of the Russian Covid-19-fake story. In order to accomplish this objective, we make use of a set of tools to extract keywords, count their frequencies and analyze corresponding contexts. We apply these tools to the compiled specialized diachronic corpus of Russian viral false Covid-19-related stories. The obtained data is evaluated to determine the dynamic of topical shifts by tracking the changes in keyword frequencies as well as the use of other high-frequency corpus words. The findings of the work concerning topical fluctuations in the Russian viral Covid-19 disinformation agenda as well as given explanations for the identified drifts in public interest in the topics during the first year of the pandemic can contribute to developing effective strategies for combating the spread of fakes in the future. © 2021 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

A 2 (uncertainty: low vs. high) × 2 (risk: low vs. high) × 2 (personal relevance: low vs. high) × 2 (attitudinal congruence with correction: incongruent vs. congruent) pretest and posttest factorial online experiment of 973 U.S. participants was conducted to examine the effectiveness of correction while controlling for misinformation source credibility. Findings suggest that correction is effective in decreasing social media users’ perceived credibility and sharing intention toward misinformation even when they are polarized on the issue of the misinformation. Interestingly, while this study confirms previous literature that users are biased toward proattitudinal correction sources than counterattitudinal ones, misinformation correction is also significantly more effective in decreasing perceived credibility and sharing intention when users are motivated by the personal relevance, uncertainty, and risks associated with the misinformation. © 2022 (Fan Yang and Holly Overton).

Researchers in this field have struggled to influence classroom practice. Purpose: The present research presents a method and a framework for video-based pedagogy analysis. Sample: Six groups of 11-year-old pupils took part (three girls and three boys) in each expert micro-teaching interview, led by a science specialist (Advanced Skills Teacher). A ‘Concurrent Verbal Protocol and Retrospective Debriefing’ interview happened with the teacher approximately one month later. Six teachers and thirty-six pupils participated altogether. Design and method: Three research methods (expert micro-teaching, verbal protocols and retrospective debriefing) were used. Data were video-recorded and managed using NVivo. About fifteen hours of video data were analysed using grounded theory methods. The interpretivist theoretical perspective (symbolic interactionism) was underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. What can be considered evidence is inevitably affected by the researcher’s methodological position. So what constitutes reliable evidence can be contentious. Appropriate criteria for evaluating the grounded theory emerging from this study were used. Interpretivist approaches for investigating conceptual change in school science are necessary to complement positivist literature. This approach, proved successful in other fields, is new to this context. Data were recorded in 2013. Results: Findings are presented as a Pedagogy Analysis Framework which uses the concepts: means (including information, misinformation and disinformation), strategy (on a spectrum from micro-strategies, through tactics to macro-strategies;), ends (physical changes, individual mental changes and group mental changes), and accidents. Conclusions: The method allows teachers to help the researcher understand incidents in video-data that are not evident to any external observer. The framework could help strategic dialogue between teachers, student teachers, mentors, teacher educators, and educational researchers. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087373061"

Drawing from processing fluency theory, we propose that an infographic – a visual representation of information – reduces cognitive load, thereby helping people retain and process the necessary information to discern truth from falsehood in health news. Design: Web-administered experiment. Setting: US web-based experiment on Qualtrics. Method: A national sample of participants was randomly assigned to one of the three conditions: a news literacy infographic, the same information but text-only, or a control group (a blank page). After the short intervention, study participants were shown false news about vaccinations and asked to make judgements about this news. Results: Our study found that people in the infographic condition were better able to verify false news than others. They also showed lower trust in false news articles and higher confidence in their judgement than those in the control condition. Conclusion: Findings further our understanding of how visuals accompanied by text, such as an infographic, can improve the quality of health education. During the current problem of digital spaces filled with misinformation, using a short intervention with visuals can help audiences determine the credibility of information they encounter about vaccines. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112450224"

We focused on conspiracy theories that did not deny the existence of COVID-19 and evaluated the extent to which they predicted a range of health protective behaviours, before and after controlling for psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with conspiracy theory belief. COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were positively correlated with beliefs in other unrelated conspiracies and a general conspiracy mind-set, and negatively correlated with trust in government and a tendency towards analytical thinking (vs. intuitive thinking). Unexpectedly, COVID-19 conspiracy believers adhered to basic health guidelines and advanced health protective measures as strictly as non-believers. Conspiracy believers were, however, less willing to install the contact-tracing app, get tested for and vaccinated against COVID-19, and were more likely to share COVID-19 misinformation—all of which might undermine public health initiatives. Study 3 showed conspiracy theory believers were less willing to undertake health protective behaviours that were outside of their personal control, perceiving these as having a negative balance of risks and benefits.

Results suggest that the effects of fact-checking are robust to different methods of measuring misinformed beliefs–even after accounting for belief certainty–and across different analytical approaches. Effects are evident among those who harbored inaccurate beliefs with high degrees of confidence.

While many warnings about political misinformation are valid and enable people to reject misleading information, the quality and validity of misinformation warnings can vary widely. Replicating and extending research from the fields of social cognition and forensic psychology, we find evidence that valid retrospective warnings of misleading news can help individuals discard erroneous information, although the corrections are weak. However, when informative news is wrongly labeled as inaccurate, these false warnings reduce the news’ credibility. Invalid misinformation warnings taint the truth, lead individuals to discard authentic information, and impede political memory.

Rumor dissemination in contemporary China reveals the public's widespread, deeply ingrained discontentment with the authorities' censorship practices. The chapter examines rumor as an ambiguous political accusation in the official discourse, and Chinese people's beliefs and practices in relation to the spreading of rumors on digital platforms in several cases.

The information was presented in a neutral context not involving Islam and focused on analysis of the misleading argumentation. The control group watched a video about an unrelated topic. Participants were then exposed to target videos with “gateway” content that constituted an entry point to potential Islamist or Islamophobic radicalization. Both videos contained numerous items of disinformation. Participants then answered a variety of questions such as how likely they were to share the video, their level of agreement, and their perceived accuracy of the video. Participants who had received the inoculation displayed less agreement with the video content, perceived the video as less reliable, and were less likely to share it in comparison with participants in the control group.

This finding is known as the illusory truth effect, and it is typically thought to occur because repetition increases processing fluency. Because fluency and truth are frequently correlated in the real world, people learn to use processing fluency as a marker for truthfulness. Although the illusory truth effect is a robust phenomenon, almost all studies examining it have used three or fewer repetitions. To address this limitation, we conducted two experiments using a larger number of repetitions. In Experiment 1, we showed participants trivia statements up to 9 times and in Experiment 2 statements were shown up to 27 times. Later, participants rated the truthfulness of the previously seen statements and of new statements. In both experiments, we found that perceived truthfulness increased as the number of repetitions increased. However, these truth rating increases were logarithmic in shape. The largest increase in perceived truth came from encountering a statement for the second time, and beyond this were incrementally smaller increases in perceived truth for each additional repetition. These findings add to our theoretical understanding of the illusory truth effect and have applications for advertising, politics, and the propagation of “fake news.”. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105842868"

Rather than political deepfakes, we use a non-political deepfake of a social media influencer as the stimulus, with an educational and a deceptive condition. We find that individuals are more likely to perceive the deepfake claim to be true when informative cues are missing along with the deepfake (compared to when they are present). Also, individuals are more likely to share deepfakes when they consider the fabricated claim to be accurate. Moreover, we find that cognitive ability plays a moderating role such that when informative cues are present (educational condition), individuals with high cognitive ability are less trustful of deepfake claims. Unexpectedly, when the informative cues are missing (deceptive condition), these individuals are more likely to consider the claim to be true and share them.

The practical relevance of this work is particularly apparent as we confront fake news everyday. Thus, an important question becomes, how can we mitigate the continued influence of misinformation? Decades of research have identified several factors that contribute to the CIE reduction, but few have reported successful elimination. Across three studies, we evaluated the relative contribution of three factors (i.e., targeting the misinformation, providing an alternative explanation, and relative importance of the misinformation content) to the reduction of the CIE. Results: Across three studies and two different CIE measures, we found that alternative provision consistently resulted in CIE reduction. Furthermore, under certain conditions, the combination of alternative inclusion and direct targeting of misinformation in the correction statement resulted in successful elimination of the CIE, such that individuals who encountered that type of correction behaved similarly to baseline participants who never encountered the (mis)information. In contrast, under one CIE measure, participants who received correction statements that failed to include those elements referenced the (mis)information as frequently as baseline participants who never encountered a correction. Finally, we delineated several component processes involved in misinformation outdating and found that the extent of outdating success varied as a function of the causality of misinformation. Conclusions: The damaging effects of fake news are undeniable, and the negative consequences are exacerbated in the digital age. Our results contribute to our understanding of how fake news persists and how we may begin to mitigate their effects. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120037035"

Additionally, while previous studies on evaluation of real and fake news have mostly focused on characteristics of the evaluator (i.e., analytical reasoning), characteristics of the news stimuli (i.e., news source credibility) and the interplay between the two have been largely ignored. To address these research gaps, this project examined the role of analytical reasoning and news source credibility on evaluation of real and fake full-length news story articles. The project considered both accuracy and perceived credibility ratings as outcome variables, thus qualifying previous work focused solely on news detection accuracy. Method: We conducted two independent but parallel studies, with Study 2 as a direct replication of Study 1, employing the same design but in a larger sample (Study 1: N = 292 vs. Study 2: N = 357). In both studies, participants viewed 12 full-length news articles (6 real, 6 fake), followed by prompts to evaluate each article’s veracity and credibility. Participants were randomly assigned to view articles with a credible or non-credible source and completed the Cognitive Reflection Test as well as short demographic questions. Findings: Consistent across both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with greater fake news accuracy, while analytical reasoning was not associated with real news accuracy. In addition, in both studies, higher analytical reasoning was associated with lower perceived credibility for fake news, while analytical reasoning was not associated with perceived credibility for real news. Furthermore, lower analytical reasoning was associated with greater accuracy for real (but not fake) news from credible compared to non-credible sources, with this effect only detected in Study 2. Conclusions: The novel results generated in this research are discussed in light of classical vs. naturalistic accounts of decision-making as well as cognitive processes underlying news articles evaluation. The results extend previous findings that analytical reasoning contributes to fake news detection to full-length news articles. Furthermore, news-related cues such as the credibility of the news source systematically affected discrimination ability between real and fake news. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103744977"

This article examines Ethiopia's policy responses towards addressing the impact of disinformation on the integrity and credibility of elections. It argues that measures taken thus far in Ethiopia appear to address the impact of disinformation on national security and social harmony.

Such processes are complicated due to the enormous number of media items being produced, how quickly media items spread, and the often-subtle or sometimes invisible-to-the-naked-eye nature of deceptive edits. Despite knowing little about the provenance and veracity of the visual content they encounter, journalists have to quickly determine whether to re-publish or amplify this content, with few tools and little time available to assist them in such an evaluation. With the goal of equipping journalists with the mechanisms, skills, and knowledge to be effective gatekeepers and stewards of the public trust, this study reviews current journalistic image verification practices, examines a number of existing and emerging image verification technologies that could be deployed or adapted to aid in this endeavour, and identifies the strengths and limitations of the most promising extant technical approaches.

Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual’s set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and “alternative facts.” © 2022 Rabb et al.

Exploring PR-based disinformation attacks as a paracrisis, the purpose of this online quasi-experimental design study (N = 965) was to investigate the effects of an attack and how prebunking strategies, grounded in inoculation theory, can protect organizational outcomes (i.e., reputation and credibility) by interweaving positive psychology. In addition to examining effects on attitudinal components, this study also inspected dimensions of social amplification to determine if prebunking messages can thwart the spread of disinformation via Facebook. Findings provide insight into advancing the conceptual framework of proactive disinformation responses for crisis communication by demonstrating the success of using prebunking with autonomy support and explicit details to thwart adverse effects of disinformation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113773631"

At the same time, they increasingly distrust traditional media and are exposed to more misinformation. To help people better distinguish real news from “fake news,” we must first understand how they judge whether news is real or fake. One possibility is that people adopt a relatively effortful, analytic approach, judging news based on its content. However, another possibility—consistent with psychological research—is that people adopt a relatively effortless, heuristic approach, drawing on cues outside of news content. One such cue is where the news comes from: its source. Beliefs about news sources depend on people’s political affiliation, with U.S. liberals tending to trust sources that conservatives distrust, and vice versa. Therefore, if people take this heuristic approach, then judgments of news from different sources should depend on political affiliation and lead to a confirmation bias of pre-existing beliefs. Similarly, political affiliation could affect the likelihood that people mistake real news for fake news. We tested these ideas in two sets of experiments. In the first set, we asked University of Louisiana at Lafayette undergraduates (Experiment 1a n = 376) and Mechanical Turk workers in the United States (Experiment 1a n = 205; Experiment 1b n = 201) to rate how “real” versus “fake” a series of unfamiliar news headlines were. We attributed each headline to one of several news sources of varying political slant. As predicted, we found that source information influenced people’s ratings in line with their own political affiliation, although this influence was relatively weak. In the second set, we asked Mechanical Turk workers in the United States (Experiment 2a n = 300; Experiment 2b n = 303) and University of Louisiana at Lafayette undergraduates (Experiment 2b n = 182) to watch a highly publicized “fake news” video involving doctored footage of a journalist. We found that people’s political affiliation influenced their beliefs about the event, but the doctored footage itself had only a trivial influence. Taken together, these results suggest that adults across a range of ages rely on information other than news content—such as how they feel about its source—when judging whether news is real or fake. Moreover, our findings help explain how people experiencing the same news content can arrive at vastly different conclusions. Finally, efforts aimed at educating the public in combatting fake news need to consider how political affiliation affects the psychological processes involved in forming beliefs about the news. © 2021 by the authors.

One of the most recent (and worrying) changes is the phenomenon of ‘fake news’, especially since disinformation and intentional misrepresentation of real information have started to affect individual decision-making in the political sphere. It is a worrying phenomenon because the dissemination of fake news can challenge demo-cratic values and undermine national security. Against this background, can copyright play a role in the fight against fake news? And what is the relationship between such news and copyright in the first place? Fake news in theory falls within copyright subject matter and may often meet the requirements for pro-tection. The paper analyses three recent examples of fake news which have been widely disseminated online – and makes the point that copyright may subsist in such news. Yet, despite such content being potentially capable of attracting protection, we propose to remove any copyright which may arise on grounds of public interest. Indeed, when a work is protected by copyright, right holders have an incentive to exploit it, as the monopoly granted to them increases the ability to extract profits out of the work, for example via licensing. This may contribute to encouraging creators of fake news to spread such content across multiple channels to reach wide audiences. Excluding copyright could therefore help make fake news less appealing. A short reference will also be made to copyright defences which may be relied on by entities and individuals who check news’ accuracy (fact-checkers) – that is, the fair use doctrine under US law and several exceptions under EU (and UK) law, namely transient use, text and data mining, criticism and review and public security. © 2021 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122231597"

We tested whether similar effects could be obtained without conscious awareness, by drawing on the metaphor “something smells fishy” linking fishy smells and suspicion (Lee, S. W. S., & Schwarz, N. [2012]. Bidirectionality, mediation, and moderation of metaphorical effects: The embodiment of social suspicion and fishy smells. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 103(5), 737–749. doi:10.1037/a0029708). In a pilot study, we established the replicability and generality of previous findings concerning this metaphorical link. We then examined the effects of the smell-suspicion link on susceptibility to misleading post-event information using the misinformation paradigm. Here, the “something smells fishy” metaphor was used to invoke suspicion and increase discrepancy detection. Forty-eight hours after viewing an event, participants received misinformation in a room sprayed with either a fishy or a neutral smell. As expected, unaware exposure to the fishy smell (compared to the neutral smell) increased discrepancy detection (measured indirectly) and resistance to the contaminating effects of misinformation, eliminating misinformation interference and lowering suggestibility on the final test. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105054099"

However, it is not clear if engaging in systematic or rigorous information searching is always protective, particularly if this involves a confirmation bias or a lack of scientific reasoning. For example, higher scores on autistic traits, which are commonly associated with a tendency to engage in systematic information searching, have been found to be associated with stronger endorsement of CT beliefs. Here, we investigated whether measures of analytical reasoning need to be refined to focus specifically on scientific reasoning, as analytical thinking has recently shown a positive association with conspiracy beliefs. A total of 565 adults with varying levels of autistic traits, completed measures of CT beliefs, standard analytical reasoning and information searching measures, but also measures of scientific reasoning and belief flexibility (using the bias against disconfirmatory evidence or BADE task). We found that standard measures of analytical thinking and active-open minded thinking were positively associated with CT beliefs and autistic traits. Conversely, higher levels of scientific reasoning and belief flexibility were negatively associated with CT beliefs, autistic and schizotypal traits. The findings encourage the use of more focused measures of logical and scientific reasoning in both psychoeducation interventions and future research relating to CT beliefs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117240160"

The presence of hate speech online is becoming increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of more than one million comments on YouTube videos through a machine learning model, trained and fine-tuned on a large set of hand-annotated data. Our analysis shows that there is no evidence of the presence of “pure haters”, meant as active users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate, violent, or hateful language within their opponents’ community. Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart. Finally, we find that the overall toxicity of the discussion increases with its length, measured both in terms of the number of comments and time. Our results show that, coherently with Godwin’s law, online debates tend to degenerate towards increasingly toxic exchanges of views. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118922038"

This social phenomenon is worrying: news that uses mathematical arguments to guide, shape, and reflect public opinion and popular thinking based on misleading information. Objectives: The aim of this investigation was to understand the role of mathematics education in the process of strengthening democracy. Data collection and analysis: A video published on a YouTube channel, in which mathematical arguments are used to convince public opinion about a certain point of view, was the object of the study whose result is presented in this paper. Design: With theoretical-methodological procedures that are based on the pragmatic theory of fixation of beliefs and on the verification of the mathematical content, the analysis adopted a qualitative approach. Setting and Participants: This is a study about a video considered false by news agencies, aired by a famous Brazilian journalist. Results: The study of fake news and desinformation scenario has allowed us to observe that mathematical speeches linked to the ideology of mathematical certainty are responsible for the establishment of beliefs and the formation of opinions by authority and tenacity methods. Conclusions: We conclude that mathematical models and mathematical discourses used in virtual communication environments can be responsible for camouflaging the human factor in political decisions and obscuring the visibility of ethical and morality variables. © 2022 Lutheran University of Brazil.

To mitigate the negative effects of misinformation, researchers have examined the efficacy of warnings that highlight the unreliability of postevent information. However, warnings have proven less effective for highly accessible misinformation (Eakin et al., 2003, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 29[5], 813–825). In the present study, we examined the effects of different types of warnings for low accessibility misinformation in a standard single test misinformation paradigm, and highly accessible misinformation in a repeated testing misinformation paradigm (Chan et al., 2009, Psychological Science, 20[1], 66–73). We modeled these warnings after Eakin et al. (2003) to include both general warnings and specific question-by-question warnings. We found that warnings were effective in both types of misinformation paradigms. Additionally, memory accuracy in situations where participants were exposed to misleading information was improved when specific and general warnings were combined.

False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103191707"

Globally, the unusual conditions of the pandemic—unlike other crises—have impacted almost every facet of our lives. The pandemic has deepened existing inequalities and created new vulnerabilities related to social isolation, incarceration, involuntary exclusion from the labor market, diminished economic opportunity, life-and-death risk in the workplace, and a host of emergent digital, emotional, and economic divides. In tandem, many less advantaged individuals and groups have suffered disproportionate hardship related to the pandemic in the form of fear and anxiety, exposure to misinformation, and the effects of the politicization of the crisis. Many of these phenomena will have a long tail that we are only beginning to understand. Nonetheless, the research also offers evidence of resilience on several fronts including nimble organizational response, emergent communication practices, spontaneous solidarity, and the power of hope. While we do not know what the post COVID-19 world will look like, the scholarship here tells us that the virus has not exhausted society’s adaptive potential. © 2021 SAGE Publications.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104319867"

Although photographs are better representations of the truth, they are not immune to bias. The angle, the composition, the lighting, the mood and the framing of the photograph can heavily influence the message conveyed through it. The advances in photography, especially panoramic imagery, have allowed for 360-degree images. Two groups of participants were surveyed and shown cropped and complete images from 360-degree photographs. There was a 50% variance in perception of messages conveyed through the cropped and the complete 360-degree images. The latter presented a more accurate and complete picture of what was happening and offered more information to the observers. The 360-degree images conveyed the message with 86% accuracy in one image set and with 60% in the other. In comparison, the cropped frames conveyed the message with 35% accuracy in one image set and with zero accuracy in the other. This indicates a massive increase in the accuracy of messaging and reduction in the bias introduced through the photographic technique and editing. 360-degree photography could revolutionize the field of photojournalism by providing more accurate and unbiased representations of incidents, subjects and their environments. © 2021.

This mixed-method study aimed to explore the study participants’ trust in scientists about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. It also aimed to reveal which key sources of information participants followed about the pandemic. Participants’ health-related behaviors and justifications for their behaviors as a response to the pandemic were also explored to understand how trust in scientists and sources of information played a role in the fight against COVID-19. The responses of 1233 participants across Turkey were analyzed. The findings indicated that trust in scientists and compliance with the scientists’ suggested behaviors among the participants were quite high. It was also revealed that, for both trust and non-trust groups, participants questioned the reliability of information and the sources. Participants justified their behaviors mainly by referring to policies, e.g., masks, distance, and hygiene, developed and implemented with the collaboration of government, scientists, and the World Health Organization. Moreover, trust issues regarding scientists, government authorities, or other citizens were mentioned in participants’ justifications. The current study also shed light on the importance of building trust through an open and healthy dialogue among scientists, government authorities, and the public to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlighted the need for scientifically informed citizens to deal with the problems, i.e., misinformation and disinformation, in the post-truth era such as not jeopardizing effective solutions to eliminate the pandemic, e.g., taking the vaccine. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124277645"

Second, we investigate the influence of an important moderator, social media news trust, that has been overlooked in prior studies. Third, we further propose a moderated moderation model by including misinformation identification.

Many of the same individuals who deny the scientific consensus on climate change are nevertheless directly impacted by the climate crisis and environmental disasters. In fossil fuel dependent locations, do people continue to deny the scientific consensus on climate change and distrust climate scientists even after themselves experiencing a catastrophic flood? This paper investigates this question through interviews with 40 people affected by the 2013 Southern Alberta Flood, the costliest flood in Canadian history, who also live in the City of Calgary, the economic hub for Canada’s tar sands. Results indicate the participants rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, voiced a distrust in the motivations of climate scientists, though hoped they would one day discover the ‘truth’, and worked discursively to protect the oil industry. The findings reveal the complexity of post-disaster environmental views and trust in science, as well as how fossil fuel dependence shapes these views. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, also false information is circulated in increasing quantities. We sought to identify social psychological factors that could explain why some people are more susceptible to false information. Specifically, we investigated whether psychological predispositions (social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification beliefs (SJB), openness, need for closure, conspiracy mentality), competencies (scientific and political knowledge, interest in politics) or motivated reasoning based on social identity (political orientation) could help explain who believes fake news. Hungarian participants (N = 295) judged political (anti- and pro-government) and non-political news. The Hungarian context—characterized by low trust in media, populist communication by the government and increasing polarization—should be fertile ground for the proliferation of fake news. The context in making this case particularly interesting is that the major political fault line in Hungary runs between pro- and anti-government supporter groups and not, for instance, between conservative and liberal ideology or partisanship. We found clear support for the motivational reasoning explanation as political orientation consistently predicted belief in both fake and real political news when their contents aligned with one’s political identity. The belief in pro-government news was also associated with higher SJB among pro-government supporters. Those interested in politics showed better capacity to distinguish real political news from the fake ones. Most importantly, the only psychological predisposition that consistently explained belief in all types of fake news was a conspiracy mentality. This supports the notion of ideological symmetry in fake news belief—where a conspiracy mentality can be found across the political spectrum, and it can make people susceptible to disinformation regardless of group-memberships and other individual differences.

Studying how people react and reflect on the information provided and how it affects their trust in health systems is essential for effective risk communication. This study was undertaken to explore and analyse newspaper readers’ reactions to the unfolding news of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and how this affected and shaped their compliance with the mitigation measures advised by the Government. Methods: We collected readers’ comments on relevant news and features on the COVID-19 outbreak (n ¼ 1,055) which were posted in the online versions of the four top circulating Bangla newspapers and one online news portal published during Jan.–Apr. 2020. A search protocol was developed and a team of three researchers searched and extracted data for content analysis according to some pre-determined study themes. Results: Data analysis revealed several characteristics with implications for risk-communication: a faith-based and fatalistic attitude to the unfolding pandemic, a “denial” syndrome in the initial stage, a returning expatriatebashing for specific countries, and a concern about the safety of the frontline health workers. The readers were resentful of the all-pervasive corruption in the health sector even in times of a pandemic and the Government's poorly coordinated, fragmented, and delayed COVID-19 response. The pandemic severely shook their trust in the already weak health system and perceived it to be incompetent, corrupt, and non-responsive. They had deplorable personal and family experiences while seeking treatment for COVID-19 patients. Expert committees were formed to advise the Government, but few recommendations were implemented on the ground. This helpless scenario made people sharply critical of the political leadership, especially for the failure of providing stewardship at the moment of crisis. Conclusions: The COVID-19 related information reaching the people, including misinformation, disinformation, and rumours was equivocal in the early months of the pandemic and failed to build the trust and transparency that is necessary for an inclusive response across constituencies. The Government should pay attention and weightage to people's perceptions about its COVID-19 response and take appropriate measures to re-build trust for implementing pandemic control measures © 2021 The Author(s).

Nevertheless, a threat of a disinformation-based attack on critical infrastructure is often overlooked. Here, we consider urban traffic networks and focus on fake information that manipulates drivers’ decisions to create congestion at a city scale. Specifically, we consider two complementary scenarios, one where drivers are persuaded to move towards a given location, and another where they are persuaded to move away from it. We study the optimization problem faced by the adversary when choosing which streets to target to maximize disruption. We prove that finding an optimal solution is computationally intractable, implying that the adversary has no choice but to settle for suboptimal heuristics. We analyze one such heuristic, and compare the cases when targets are spread across the city of Chicago vs. concentrated in its business district. Surprisingly, the latter results in more far-reaching disruption, with its impact felt as far as 2 km from the closest target. Our findings demonstrate that vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure may arise not only from hardware and software, but also from behavioral manipulation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102186087"

The novelty of the current study is in examining conditions in which AFB occurs or does not occur. Typically, AFB is examined for favorable outcomes (e.g., 80% success / 20% failure); the current study extended the examination to unfavorable outcomes (e.g., 80% failure / 20% success). According to fuzzy-trace theory, information is encoded both as a detailed verbatim representation and as a fuzzy gist representation, and AFB is elicited by the vague gist representations that maintain either the positive or the negative valence of the message. The current study offers a novel insight into the relationship between gist and verbatim representations in AFB by examining how it is moderated by the favorability of the outcomes. In three experiments, we focused on the perceived reliability of news items. As fake news has become an issue of major concern, some news media publish truthfulness evaluations; however, the framing of such evaluations may bias the perceived reliability of news. Hence, we examined to what extent the favorability of the outcomes moderated AFB in perceived news reliability. The results showed that attribute framing biased the perceived reliability of news when truthfulness outcomes were favorable (80% true / 20% fake) but not when outcomes were unfavorable (20% true / 80% fake).

Many online platforms have taken steps to address this by adding a warning label to articles identified as false, but past research has shown mixed evidence for the effectiveness of such labels, and many prior studies have looked only at either short-term impacts or non-political information. This study tested three versions of fake news labels with 541 online participants in a two-wave study. A warning that came before a false headline was initially very effective in both discouraging belief in false headlines generally and eliminating a partisan congruency effect (the tendency to believe politically congenial information more readily than politically uncongenial information). In the follow-up survey two weeks later, however, we found both high levels of belief in the articles and the re-emergence of a partisan congruency effect in all warning conditions, even though participants had known just two weeks ago the items were false. The new pre-warning before the headline showed some small improvements over other types, but did not stop people from believing the article once seen again without a warning. This finding suggests that warnings do have an important immediate impact and may work well in the short term, though the durability of that protection is limited. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111251059"

Although misled participants accurately rejected blatant suggestions when tested with simple questions, there was a two-fold increase in false assents when multifaceted questions were used (Experiment 1). Providing participants with explicit instructions on how to respond to multifaceted questions (i.e., respond “yes” only if all parts of the question are true) improved accuracy slightly but did not mitigate the magnitude of the misinformation effect (Experiment 2).

In the current investigation, we examined children’s ability to use credibility information about websites when learning about environmental sustainability. In two studies, children studied two different websites and were tested on what they had learned a week later using a multiple-choice test containing both website items and new distracters. Children were given either no information about the websites or were told that one of the websites (the noncredible website) contained errors and they should not use any information from that website to answer the test. In both studies, children aged 7- to 9-years reported information from the noncredible website even when instructed not to, whereas the 10- to 12-year-olds used the credibility warning to ‘edit out’ information that they had learned from the noncredible website. In Study 2, there was an indication that the older children spontaneously assessed the credibility of the website if credibility markers were made explicit. A plausible explanation is that, although children remembered information from the websites, they needed explicit instruction to bind the website content with the relevant source (the individual websites). The results have implications for children’s learning in an open-access, digital age where information comes from many sources, credible and noncredible. Education in credibility evaluation may enable children to be critical consumers of information thereby resisting misinformation provided through public sources. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107032353"

Using two national surveys from 2019 and 2020, we find that this dimension of opinion is correlated with several antisocial psychological traits, the acceptance of political violence, and time spent on extremist social media platforms. It is also related to support for populist candidates, such as Trump and Sanders, and beliefs in misinformation and conspiracy theories. While many inherently view politics as a conflict between left and right, others see it as a battle between “the people” and a corrupt establishment.

Accordingly, this paper analyses the level of misinformation in the coverage of the 2020 winter football transfer window in four leading European digital sports media outlets: Marca (Spain), A Bola (Portugal), La Gazzetta (Italy) and The Guardian Sport (Britain). The methodology used was based on the content analysis of hundreds of news pieces and tweets posted on these outlets’ football homepages and Twitter handles over a month. To examine to what extent this coverage may have been speculative, misleading or false, the misinformation matrix developed by the fact-checking organisation First Draft News was employed to classify five different types of inaccuracies in sports reporting. A system was also created to determine how many reported rumours finally turned out to be true, which sources were more reliable and what outlets resulted more accurate. The findings reveal that the four digital media published a larger amount of non-factual content about likely football deals rather than sealed transfers. Speculative reporting prevailed in the coverage of the top teams in each league, on which the media outlets placed the accent, whereas reporting about minor clubs was based more on factual news. © 2021 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168610414"

This “viral” spread of fake news created an “infodemic” that threatened the compliance with public health guidelines and recommendations. Objective This study aims to describe the trust in social media platforms and the exposure to fake news about COVID-19 in Lebanon and to explore their association with vaccination intent. Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted in Lebanon during July–August, 2020, a random sample of 1052 participants selected from a mobile-phone database responded to an anonymous structured questionnaire after obtaining informed consent (response rate = 40%). The questionnaire was conducted by telephone and measured socio-demographics, sources and trust in sources of information and exposure to fake news, social media activity, perceived threat and vaccination intent. Results Results indicated that the majority of participants (82%) believed that COVID-19 is a threat and 52% had intention to vaccinate. Exposure to fake/ unverified news was high (19.7% were often and 63.8% were sometimes exposed, mainly to fake news shared through Watsapp and Facebook). Trust in certain information sources (WHO, MoPH and TV) increased while trust in others (Watsapp, Facebook) reduced vaccination intent against Covid-19. Believing in the man-made theory and the business control theory significantly reduced the likelihood of vaccination intent (Beta = 0.43; p = 0.01 and Beta = -0.29; p = 0.05) respectively. Conclusion In the context of the infodemic, understanding the role of exposure to fake news and of conspiracy believes in shaping healthy behavior is important for increasing vaccination intent and planning adequate response to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of social-emotional headline contents on social judgments and brain responses and whether they can be modulated by explicit evaluations of the trustworthiness of the media source. Participants (N = 30) evaluated –and clearly discerned– the trustworthiness of news sources before they were exposed to person-related news headlines. Despite this intervention, social judgments and brain responses were dominated largely by emotional headline contents. Results suggest differential effects of source credibility might depend on headline valence. Electrophysiological indexes of fast emotional and arousal-related brain responses, as well as correlates of slow evaluative processing were enhanced for persons associated with positive headline contents from trusted sources, but not when positive headlines stemmed from distrusted sources. In contrast, negative headlines dominated fast and slow brain responses unaffected by explicit source credibility evaluations. These results provide novel insights into the brain mechanisms underlying the “success” of emotional news from untrustworthy sources, suggesting a pronounced susceptibility to negative information even from distrusted sources that is reduced for positive contents. The differential pattern of responses to misinformation in mind and brain sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of misinformation and possible strategies to avoid their potentially detrimental effects. © 2021 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115192716"

We identify a factor that, alongside accuracy, drives the sharing of true and fake news: the ‘interestingness-if-true’ of a piece of news. In three pre-registered experiments (N = 904), participants were presented with a series of true and fake news, and asked to rate the accuracy of the news, how interesting the news would be if it were true, and how likely they would be to share it. Participants were more willing to share news they found more interesting-if-true, as well as news they deemed more accurate. They deemed fake news less accurate but more interesting-if-true than true news, and were more likely to share true news than fake news. As expected, interestingness-if-true differed from interestingness and accuracy, and had good face validity. Higher trust in mass media was associated with a greater ability to discern true from fake news, and participants rated as more accurate news that they had already been exposed to (especially for true news). We argue that people may not share news of questionable accuracy by mistake, but instead because the news has qualities that compensate for its potential inaccuracy, such as being interesting-if-true. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113329865"

This is a serious threat to the quality of witness testimony and to the correctness of decisions reached by courts. However, few methods have been developed to reduce the vulnerability of witnesses to misinformation. This article presents such a method, namely, reinforced self-affirmation (RSA), which, by increasing memory confidence of witnesses, makes them less inclined to rely on external sources of information and more on their own memory. The effectiveness of this method was confirmed in three experiments. It was also found that memory confidence, but not general self-confidence, is a mediator of the impact of RSA on misinformation effect (ME), and that contingent self-esteem and feedback acceptance, but not sense of self-efficacy or general self-esteem, are moderators of this impact. It is concluded that RSA may be a promising basis for constructing methods, which can be used by forensic psychologists in real forensic settings.

Since these problems have the potential to erode the legitimacy of Australian elections, it is imperative to deepen understanding of these risks to optimise the nation’s democratic resilience.

However, science misinformation is ubiquitous in the media, making it difficult to apply research appropriately. Across two experiments, we addressed how anecdotes and prior beliefs impact readers’ ability to both identify flawed science and make appropriate decisions based on flawed science in media articles. Each article described the results of flawed research on one of four educational interventions to improve learning (Experiment 1 included articles about having a tidy classroom and exercising while learning; Experiment 2 included articles about using virtual/augmented reality and napping at school). Experiment 1 tested the impact of a single anecdote and found no significant effect on either participants’ evidence evaluations or decisions to implement the learning interventions. However, participants were more likely to adopt the more plausible intervention (tidy classroom) despite identifying that it was unsupported by the evidence, suggesting effects of prior beliefs. In Experiment 2, we tested whether this intervention effect was driven by differences in beliefs about intervention plausibility and included two additional interventions (virtual reality = high plausible, napping = low plausible). We again found that participants were more likely to implement high plausible than low plausible interventions, and that evidence quality was underweighed as a factor in these decisions. Together, these studies suggest that evidence-based decisions are more strongly determined by prior beliefs than beliefs about the quality of evidence itself. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103997768"

Misinformation streams such as these potentially pose risks to people's health. Thus, knowing how these pseudoscientific beliefs and fake news impact the community of internists may be useful for improving primary care services. In this research, analyses of stress levels, effectiveness in detecting fake news, use of critical thinking (CP), and attitudes toward pseudosciences in internists during the COVID-19 crisis were performed. A total of 1129 internists participated. Several multiple regression models were applied using the forward stepwise method to determine the weight of CP and physicians' attitudes toward pseudosciences in predicting reductions in stress levels and facilitating the detection of fake news. The use of critical thinking predicted 46.9% of the reduction in stress levels. Similarly, skeptical attitudes and critical thinking predicted 56.1% of the hits on fake news detection tests. The stress levels of physicians during the coronavirus pandemic were clinically significant. The efficacy of fake news detection increases by 30.7% if the individual was a physician. Study outcomes indicate that the use of critical thinking and skeptical attitudes reduce stress levels and allow better detection of fake news. The importance of how to promote critical and skeptical attitudes in the field of medicine is discussed. © 2021","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114152717"

We propose that one reason is that people value connecting and fitting in with others, motivating them to seek the common ground of communication and generate explanations for how claims might make sense. This increases the likelihood that people experience empty claims as truthful, meaningful, or even profound. Seven studies (N. 16,000 from the United States and China) support our prediction. People who score higher in collectivism (valuing connection and fitting in) are more likely to find fake news meaningful and believe in pseudoscience (Studies 1 to 3). China–U.S. cross-national comparisons show parallel effects. Relative to people from the United States, Chinese participants are more likely to see meaning in randomly generated vague claims (Study 4). People higher in collectivism are more likely to engage in meaning-making, generating explanations when faced with an empty claim, and having done so, are more likely to find meaning (Study 5). People who momentarily experience themselves as more collectivistic are more likely to see empty claims as meaningful (Study 6). People higher in collectivism are more likely to engage in meaning-making unless there is no common ground to seek (Study 7).

Although Indigenous Peoples have maintained fire stewardship practices for millennia and continue to be keepers of fire knowledge, significant barriers exist for re-engaging in cultural burning. Indigenous communities in Canada have unique vulnerabilities to large and high-intensity wildfires as they are predominately located in remote, forested regions and lack financial support at federal and provincial levels to mitigate wildfire risk. Therefore, it is critical to uphold Indigenous expertise in leading effective and socially just fire stewardship. In this perspective, we demonstrate the benefits of cultural burning and identify five key barriers to advancing Indigenous fire stewardship in Canada. We also provide calls to action to assist with reducing preconceptions and misinformation and focus on creating space and respect for different knowledges and experiences. Despite growing concerns over wildfire risk and agency-stated intentions to establish Indigenous Peoples as partners in wildfire management, power imbalances still exist. The future and coexistence with fire in Canada needs to be a shared responsibility and led by Indigenous Peoples within their territories.

In order to understand the threat posed by such extremists in the Australian national security context, this study investigates how extremists incorporated contemporary events in Australia and beyond its borders into their COVID-19-related narratives. This article traverses three ideological milieus and examines violent Salafi-Jihadism, the extreme right, and the extreme left. By studying how ideological milieus interact with the current pandemic context, it is possible to observe the fluctuation of ideological constructs through the identified narratives. These narratives were not solely propagated online as may have been expected: instead, there was observable offline dissemination as well. While little was found on the extreme left, this study found that violent Salafi-Jihadist and extreme-right milieus interpreted COVID-19 in ideologically self-serving ways. In some cases, COVID-19 was used to buttress existing narratives, while there was also evidence of narrative diversification, with seemingly ideologically contradictory positions adopted. These impact national security in Australia in three ways: first, buttressing may reinforce extremist distrust of authorities and cement positions; second, diversification complicates the threatscape by challenging efficient identification; third, the co-optation of idiosyncratic conspiracies has exposed the vulnerability of democratic societies to misinformation. © 2021,Perspectives on Terrorism.

Our analysis explores the response to the review of the list of cases, Strike Force Parrabell, as an illustration of runaway constructionism. Demand group-interest in the positive designation of the cases (as bias crime) was a means of acknowledging the prejudicial conduct of police during a time of wider attitudinal change. In spearheading the verification of this list of cases, demand groups and crusaders placed a high semiotic burden beyond its capacity as a comparable objective measure. The fitness of the list of 88 cases as a totem for police and societal wrongdoing requires evidence regarding disproportionality based on valid and reliable measures. Despite worldwide interest in NSW for its comparative high ranking in gay bias homicides, however, such ranking does not exist. Nonetheless, despite the impossibility that it stands in as proof of decades long prejudice, corruption or criminal negligence, the list of cases appears to do so anyway. As such, it is illustrative of the occupation of media frames and formats by weak data or of the runaway character of crime stories in an era of “fake news.”. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087728125"

The authors created and distributed a self-administered online questionnaire using Google Forms. Data were collected from 351 respondents ranging in age from 19 to 30 years, studying at the graduate and postgraduate levels at various public universities in Bangladesh. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that belief in conspiracy theory undermines COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, thereby negatively impacting the individual attitudes, subjective norms, and acceptance. Individual awareness, on the other hand, has a strong positive influence on the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of vaccination and the perceived ease of obtaining the vaccine positively impact attitude and the acceptance of immunization. Individuals’ positive attitudes toward immunization and constructive subjective norms have a positive impact on vaccine acceptance. This study contributes to the literature by combining the theory of reasoned action with conspiracy theory, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to understand vaccine acceptance behavior. Authorities should focus on campaigns that could reduce misinformation and conspiracy surrounding COVID-19 vaccination. The perceived usefulness of vaccination to prevent pandemics and continue normal education will lead to vaccination success. Furthermore, the ease with which people can obtain the vaccine and that it is free of cost will encourage students to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families, and society. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

In the Arab region, the media spheres have been saturated with information regarding coronavirus news. From social and traditional media, Arab audiences have been bombarded with a plethora of information, some of which was confusing and contradictory. As coronavirus sweeps across the world, many questions have been raised about the possibility of practicing the rites of the month of Ramadan and to observe fasting by Muslims. With the multiplication of the responses from medical staff, doctors of the law and political representatives, COVID-19 has simultaneously become a health, reli-gious, political and ethical problem for the Muslim world. The premise elaborated so far calls for an in-depth research on the return of news on the official Facebook pages of three online magazines during the coronavirus emergency. The research carries out a qualitative media content analysis of all the news published by three digital ethnic newspapers: The Muslim News (United Kingdom), the Saphir News (France) and the Daily Muslim (Italy). The magazines have undertaken to stem the spread of fake news by offering users data and updates on COVID-19, proposing themselves as authoritative voices and reliable sources of informa-tion. Ramadan turns out to be a very central element in the three magazines in different measures, since it is an issue that becomes more and more urgent for the Muslim community as the weeks go by. The centrality of the religious element in the information flows is in line with the centrality of Islam in the individual and community life of the faithful. The health and religious emergency were narrated together providing updates on the daily measures to be put in place. Individuals have been called to face the health emergency stimulated by their sense of respon-sibility towards others also through religious principles. Social media have played an important role from religious, cultural and social points of view in one of the most important moments of the year for the Islamic community. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

The effects of such questionable information primarily concern the lack of compliance with restrictive measures and a negative attitude towards vaccination campaigns, as well as more complex social effects, such as street protests or distrust in governments and authorities in general. Even though there is a lot of scholarly attention given to these narratives in many countries, research about the profile of people who are more prone to believe or spread them is rather scarce. In this context, we investigate the role of age, compared with other socio-demographic factors (such as education and religiosity), as well as the role of the media (the frequency of news consumption, the perceived usefulness of social media, and the perceived incidence of fake information about the virus in the media) and the critical thinking disposition of people who tend to believe such misleading narratives. To address these issues, we conducted a national survey (N = 945) in April 2021 in Romania. Using a hierarchical OLS regression model, we found that people who perceive higher incidence of fake news (ß = 0.33, p < 0.001), find social media platforms more useful (ß = 0.13, p < 0.001), have lower education (ß = −0.17, p < 0.001), and have higher levels of religiosity (ß = 0.08, p < 0.05) are more prone to believe COVID-19-related misleading narratives. At the same time, the frequency of news consumption (regardless of the type of media), critical thinking disposition, and age do not play a significant role in the profile of the believer in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Somewhat surprisingly, age does not play a role in predicting belief in conspiracy theories, even though there are studies that suggest that older people are more prone to believe conspiracy narratives. As far as media is concerned, the frequency of news media consumption does not significantly differ for believers and non-believers. We discuss these results within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

The current study aimed to test whether correcting misinformation increases belief more than a no-correction control. Furthermore, we aimed to examine whether item-level differences in backfire rates were associated with test–retest reliability or theoretically meaningful factors. These factors included worldview-related attributes, including perceived importance and strength of precorrection belief, and familiarity-related attributes, including perceived novelty and the illusory truth effect. In 2 nearly identical experiments, we conducted a longitudinal pre/post design with N = 388 and 532 participants. Participants rated 21 misinformation items and were assigned to a correction condition or test-retest control. We found that no items backfired more in the correction condition compared to test-retest control or initial belief ratings. Item backfire rates were strongly negatively correlated with item reliability (q = -.61/-.73) and did not correlate with worldview-related attributes. Familiarity-related attributes were significantly correlated with backfire rate, though they did not consistently account for unique variance beyond reliability. While there have been previous papers highlighting the nonreplicable nature of backfire effects, the current findings provide a potential mechanism for this poor replicability. It is crucial for future research into backfire effects to use reliable measures, report the reliability of their measures, and take reliability into account in analyses.

Through the implicit application of a tri-theoretical framework of DEG, democratic theory, and institutional theory, I argue that DEG has induced a series of new vulnerabilities in Australia’s political processes and institutions that challenge the legitimacy of decision-making inputs and outputs. MFEs may exploit these potential vulnerabilities by tapping into key digitally-amplified problems such as inauthenticity, data insecurity, and disinformation, thereby threatening Australia’s democratic sovereignty. © 2022 Australian Political Studies Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122476150"

To enhance rumor detectors, we first need to better understand which rumors are effective (in terms of bypassing detection) and their characteristics. In this paper, we introduce ARGH, a novel framework to automatically generate rumors using recent advancements in natural language processing, customized to target and generate specific topics. To show the effectiveness of ARGH, we conducted a user study with 212 participants and analyzed how well humans can detect the rumors generated by ARGH, and we also tested its performance against the state-of-the-art rumor detection model PLAN [17]. Surprisingly, the experimental results demonstrate that the generated rumors are significantly harder to identify as rumors than hand-written rumors, degrading the detection accuracy by both humans and machines by 18.87% and 17.62%, respectively. We believe that ARGH will be a useful tool to obtain high quality and evasive rumor datasets quickly, which is often a tedious and time consuming task. Further, our analysis results provide valuable insight into how to characterize evasive rumors and how they can be generated, which will help to enhance the existing rumor detection techniques. © 2021 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119188140"

In recent years, several divergent correction formats have been proposed as superior based on distinct theoretical frameworks. However, these correction formats have not been compared in controlled settings, so the suggested superiority of each format remains speculative. Across four experiments, the current paper investigated how altering the format of corrections influences people’s subsequent reliance on misinformation. We examined whether myth-first, fact-first, fact-only, or myth-only correction formats were most effective, using a range of different materials and participant pools. Experiments 1 and 2 focused on climate change misconceptions; participants were Qualtrics online panel members and students taking part in a massive open online course, respectively. Experiments 3 and 4 used misconceptions from a diverse set of topics, with Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers and university student participants. We found that the impact of a correction on beliefs and inferential reasoning was largely independent of the specific format used. The clearest evidence for any potential relative superiority emerged in Experiment 4, which found that the myth-first format was more effective at myth correction than the fact-first format after a delayed retention interval. However, in general it appeared that as long as the key ingredients of a correction were presented, format did not make a considerable difference. This suggests that simply providing corrective information, regardless of format, is far more important than how the correction is presented. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122109098"

To help citizens, these entities have developed a wide range of actions that range from online seminars, to learning how to evaluate the quality of a source, to video tutorials or the creation of repositories with resources of various natures. To identify the most common media literacy practices in the face of fake news (news that conveys or incorporates false, fabricated, or deliberately misleading information), this exploratory study designed an ad hoc analysis sheet, validated by the inter-judge method, which allowed one to classify the practices of N = 216 libraries from all over the world. The results reveal that the libraries most involved in this task are those belonging to public universities. Among the actions carried out to counteract misinformation, open-access materials that favor self-learning stand out. These resources, aimed primarily at university students and adults in general, are aimed at acquiring skills related to fact-checking and critical thinking.

In combatting misinformation, simply throwing uncontrolled argumentation at the problem is often counter-productive, partially because the means by which people evaluate arguments are highly subject to cognitive biases. Such biases which promote jumping to unwarranted conclusions have been shown to correlate with conspiratorial belief. We consider the use of Controlled Argumentation Dialogue Environments (CADEs) as a means to mitigate cognitive biases which contribute to belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We will discuss Warrant Game (WG) and Warrant Game for Analogies (WG-A), CADEs in which two arguers are presented with a divisive issue and two competing positions on that issue. They then compete by iteratively improving warrants for their arguments and attacking those of their opponents. The warrant, when made explicit, makes it easier to determine key features typically associated with argument strength and may reveal hidden assumptions or fundamental reasoning incompatibilities. By presenting an issue and positions which relate to conspiratorial thinking, CADEs may operate as an educational tool for breaking conspiratorial belief into core values and building cognitive skills. © 2022, The Author(s).","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126187478"

This claim has not been assessed based on evidence. We evaluated if health misinformation became more common during the pandemic. We gathered about 325 million posts sharing URLs from Twitter and Facebook during the beginning of the pandemic (March 8-May 1, 2020) compared to the same period in 2019. We relied on source credibility as an accepted proxy for misinformation across this database. Human annotators also coded a subsample of 3000 posts with URLs for misinformation. Posts about COVID-19 were 0.37 times as likely to link to “not credible” sources and 1.13 times more likely to link to “more credible” sources than prior to the pandemic. Posts linking to “not credible” sources were 3.67 times more likely to include misinformation compared to posts from “more credible” sources. Thus, during the earliest stages of the pandemic, when claims of an infodemic emerged, social media contained proportionally less misinformation than expected based on the prior year. Our results suggest that widespread health misinformation is not unique to COVID-19. Rather, it is a systemic feature of online health communication that can adversely impact public health behaviors and must therefore be addressed. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

Nevertheless, as this paper identifies there are potential challenges associated with the use social media, i.e. trust and credibility, misinformation, and digital inequality. This study uses three case studies to analyze the Indonesian government’s messaging strategies on social media for disaster risk communication, while navigating these challenges. Thematic content analysis of Indonesian emergency units’ social media posts during disaster events and of in-depth interviews with the personnel of the government agencies reveal the problematic aspects of the unidirectional top-down pattern of social media disaster risk communication. The messages mainly convey information about situations related to the disasters and government activities in local communities during disasters. Government agencies did not see social media as an appropriate channel for local communities most likely to be impacted or that such communities are shaped by culturally embedded beliefs and who might have limited accesses to the technology. This study suggests that patterns of social media use for disaster risk communication can differ across cultures. The collectivist culture of Indonesian communities has led to the two-step flow of communication model that proposes embracing culture and social capital to build trust, credibility, and overcome digital inequalities. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121105762"

The analysis revealed that although decided voters have more doubt in the accuracy of the news media, they still consume more news from more diverse sources, highlighting decideds as more critical and simultaneously more informed than undecideds.

It was found that regardless of story framing the majority of responses involved users engaging in debate and discussion rather than sharing personal experiences. Furthermore, stories framed episodically had a greater proportion of both supportive and unsupportive comments than stories framed thematically. As predicted, episodic stories were associated with more attributions of responsibility directed towards the individual whereas thematic stories lead to more societal-level attributions of blame. Contrary to predictions, responses did not contribute towards the stigmatisation of lung cancer, instead more responses were aimed at reducing stigma for this illness. Within the findings strong beliefs about cancer treatment and management were also identified, which raises concern over the spread of misinformation.

Consistent with our hypotheses, Trump voters’ susceptibility to misinformation about voter fraud and refusals to accept the election results as legitimate drastically increased to the extent to which they were entrenched in politically homophilic networks. Biden voters modestly strengthened their views of the election results as legitimate when entrenched in politically homophilic networks. Moreover, the influence of politically homophilic networks in facilitating this polarization grew stronger with the passage of time.

That change raised the following questions: What factors predicted an increased willingness to inoculate against COVID-19? And, to what extent was the change driven by COVID-specific factors, such as personalworry about the disease and COVID-specific misinformation, and to what extent by background (non-COVID-specific) factors, such as trust in medical authorities, accurate/inaccurate information about vaccination, vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance? This panel study of more than 8,000 individuals found that trust in health authorities anchored acceptance of vaccination and that knowledge about vaccination, flu vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance played a more prominent role in shifting individuals from vaccination hesitance to acceptance than COVID-specific factors. COVID-specific conspiracy beliefs did play a role, although a lesser one. These findings underscore the need to reinforce trust in health experts, facilitate community engagement with them, and preemptively communicate the benefits and safety record of authorized vaccines.

The value of SDT for understanding the determinants of fake-news beliefs is illustrated with reanalyses of existing data sets, providing more nuanced insights into how partisan bias, cognitive reflection, and prior exposure influence the identification of fake news.

In the current debate on ‘post-truth politics’ the emphasis is often put on the formulation of ethical guidelines and legal solutions to regain control over ‘unbound journalism’ or to re-establish truth in the news media. Instead of holding journalists individually accountable for the spread of fake news, we consider truth as an unstable outcome of fact-finding, information-seeking and contestation, where journalists act as professional brokers. Journalists are not individuals that are closer to facts or more devoted to truth than others. They are rather embedded in a professional field of journalism practices that help to establish the value of information in a trusted way that becomes acceptable and convincing for the majority. Standards and procedures of journalism can therefore not be applied in a way to detect truth in an absolute way and defend it against falsehood, but to approach truth in the most reliable and acceptable way. The truth value of information then becomes the (unstable) outcome of a democratically necessary procedure of critical debate facilitated by journalists. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120409589"

The prevalence of these neuromyths may be problematic, leading people to spend resources on ineffective study methods and propagate misinformation. Therefore, we examined whether erroneous beliefs in neuromyths could be corrected using various forms of refutations. Across two experiments, participants viewed true and false statements (neuromyths) about learning and brain function and indicated whether the statements were true or false. Participants then received one of three types of corrections (refutation-only, refutation-explanation, refutation-explanation and image) or no correction (control). One week and 1 month later, participants again indicated their beliefs in the true statements and the neuromyths. Results showed that all three refutations were effective for correcting erroneous beliefs in neuromyths, and this corrective effect was present after 1 week and 1 month.

The article is based on how Jacques Derrida’s discussion with Immanuel Kant regarding how truth should sound before the apocalypse over the years has increasingly come to describe contemporary doxa, within which there is only room for mystagogues, who inaugurate followers in the “real truth” behind “fake news”, or scientisticists, who believe that facts and truth are the same thing. When Derrida shows how these two positions depend on each other, sharing the modern belief that knowledge is associated with development, boundaries and control, he also shows how this narrows knowledge down to the predictable, and, thus, makes it complicit with the mistaken efforts of control responsible for today’s challenges.

First, group-level predictors were explored, with studies revealing that religious affiliation and conservative political orientation were associated with a failure to comply with medical recommendations. In order to explain these links, individual-level traits were further investigated. Studies indicated that a tendency towards conspiratorial thinking and susceptibility to fake news along with cognitive style, particularly intuitive processing, were forms of motivated cognition related to disbelief in science and a reluctance to follow precautions of medical experts. Additionally, research revealed that cognitive ability has been shown to be related to the two group-level predictors, religious and political orientation, as well as belief revision, which in turn influences one’s ability to problem-solve in response to novel challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the level of health information literacy and informational skills determines the individuals’ ability to obtain credible health information useful for them. This study investigates the Egyptian LIS undergraduates’ health information behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study has adopted a quantitative approach using a questionnaire to explore library and information science undergraduates’ health information behaviour. A sample of 161 students answered a questionnaire. The data were analysed using SPSS software. The study results show that official health websites, social media, and family and friends are the primary sources for health information for the participants. The findings also revealed that the sample has adequate health information skills, though many of the participants still need to raise their information literacy skills. Information credibility and personal beliefs were found to affect the participants’ decision to share health information on the Internet. One of the limitations of the study is that the sample selected in this study was LIS students who are trained to find reliable information as part of their education. Findings may be different for the “average” student. Furthermore, the questionnaire was distributed in one university, which means that the results cannot be generalised in other LIS departments using different courses. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted in other LIS departments with different course plans as they may produce different results. This study explores the health information behaviour of LIS undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study results may help develop the course plan in many LIS departments in Egypt and the Middle East, which would help improve the students’ health information literacy. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097276041"

It addresses current political, social, and cultural issues influencing the practice of media and communication. I argue that fake news in the 21st century is distinguished by the technologies that allow it to mimic legitimate journalism and be disseminated globally without barriers. When unpacking the significance of fake news as it exists today, two elements must be examined: fake news as misrepresentation and fake news as an attack on journalists. The chapter ends with a consideration of journalism can best take on this phenomenon to combat fake news while continuing to engage in ethical practice that upholds long-standing principles and values. Journalists must engage in good reporting that includes multiple viewpoints and supported claims while also honestly critiquing so-called objective journalism.

We investigated whether subscribers to a fact checking newsletter (n = 1397) were willing to share possible misinformation, and whether predictors of possible misinformation sharing are the same as for general samples. We also investigated predictors of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24% of participants had shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower belief in science. Like general samples, our participants were typically motivated to share possible misinformation due to interest in the information, or to seek a second opinion about claim veracity. However, even if information is shared in good faith and not for the purpose of deceiving or misleading others, the spread of misinformation is nevertheless highly problematic. Exposure to misinformation engenders faulty beliefs in others and undermines efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by reducing adherence to social distancing measures and increasing vaccine hesitancy.

Health practitioners and governments around the world have issued recommendations and mandates designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by influencing the social behaviors of the general public. Why and when are some people unwilling to take action to protect themselves and others from the effects of this public health crisis? We find that belief in COVID-19 consensus information (by the self or perceptions of scientists’ beliefs), are consequential predictors of COVID-19 mitigation behaviors. Importantly, support for COVID-19 conspiracy theories predicted decreased, whereas perceived understanding of COVID-19 predicted increased, belief in COVID-19 consensus information. We also implemented an Illusion of Explanatory depth paradigm, an approach to examining knowledge overestimation shown to reduce confidence in one’s understanding of complex phenomena. By requiring participants to elaborate upon COVID-19 conspiracies, we experimentally increased understanding of these theories, which led, in turn, to ironic increases in support for the conspiracy theories and undermined perceived understanding of COVID-19 information for a notable portion of our participants. Together, our results suggest that attention given to COVID-19 conspiracies may be misguided; describing or explaining the existence of COVID-19 conspiracies may ironically increase support for these accounts and undermine knowledge about and willingness to engage in COVID-19 mitigation.

This overconfidence is, in turn, correlated with consequential differences in real-world beliefs and behavior. We show that overconfident individuals are more likely to visit untrustworthy websites in behavioral data; to fail to successfully distinguish between true and false claims about current events in survey questions; and to report greater willingness to like or share false content on social media, especially when it is politically congenial. In all, these results paint a worrying picture: The individuals who are least equipped to identify false news content are also the least aware of their own limitations and, therefore, more susceptible to believing it and spreading it further. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Overall, repetition increased participants’ belief in coronavirus-related information. However, the increase was significantly larger for less-known compared to well-known statements.

This research takes as a case study the coverage given by the Spanish digital media to a hoax broadcast during the Filomena storm in 2021 that insisted that the snow was plastic. The purpose of this work is to analyze the instrumentalization of fake information as an expression of the information media crisis in the current context of disinformation. We set out four specific objectives: (SO1) to study the spread of the hoax through the media, (SO2) to analyze the construction of headlines in the news pieces, (SO3) to investigate the treatment of the hoax in the content of the pieces, and (SO4) to analyze the sources used in the pieces. To reflect on this phenomenon, we propose a three-dimensional model (structural, economic, and pragmatic) aimed at clarifying the relationship between the logic of the spread of hoaxes on the Internet and the role played by traditional media in their diffusion. The methodology used combines workflow techniques of digital methods with quantitative and content analyses. The results reveal the appropriation of certain communication strategies by digital newspapers aimed at obtaining visits. We conclude that the Spanish media, by adapting to the dynamics of disinformation irresponsibly encouraged by the attention economy, subscribe to and reinforce the crisis of credibility faced by the media ecosystem. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Assertion of belief is inflated, we suggest, by insincere report, whether to express support for one side of political debate or simply for fun. It is also inflated by the use of motivated inference of one sort or another, which leads respondents to report believing things about which they had no opinion prior to being probed.

The theory has been applied in a number of contexts (e.g., politics, health) in its 50+ year history. Importantly, one of the newest contexts for inoculation theory is work in the area of contested science, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. Recent research has revealed that when a desirable position on a scientific issue (e.g., climate change) exists, conventional preemptive (prophylactic) inoculation can help to protect it from misinformation, and that even when people have undesirable positions, “therapeutic” inoculation messages can have positive effects. We call for further research to explain and predict the efficacy of inoculation theory in this new context to help inform better public understandings of issues such as climate change, genetically modified organisms, vaccine hesitancy, and other contested science beliefs such as conspiracy theories about COVID-19. © 2021 The Authors.

Four preregistered experiments (N = 532, N = 472, N = 605, N = 382) with online U.S. samples introduced false claims concerning a (fictional) virus created as a bioweapon, mirroring conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and carcinogenic effects of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms). We identify two critical determinants of vulnerability to pseudoscience. First, participants who trust science are more likely to believe and disseminate false claims that contain scientific references than false claims that do not. Second, reminding participants of the value of critical evaluation reduces belief in false claims, whereas reminders of the value of trusting science do not. We conclude that trust in science, although desirable in many ways, makes people vulnerable to pseudoscience.

In total, 25 young adults aged between 18 and 29 years formed one sample and participated in one of four focus groups. The second sample consisted of 10 industry professionals with backgrounds in policing, corrections, and forensic psychology. Each professional participated in an individual semistructured interview. Both samples were asked questions regarding vulnerability and safety in public, where responses were analyzed using a thematic analysis. Multiple themes were identified and categorized into situational and individual factors associated with victimization. Situational factors referred to aspects of the environment that may influence vulnerability to PSV and included visibility, location, and level of support for potential victims. Individual factors referred to aspects about the person that may influence vulnerability to PSV and included unpredictability, ease of target, stereotypes, in-groups versus out-groups, distractions, and personality traits. Although both samples identified similar situational factors, young adults were found to be either unaware of individual factors identified by industry professionals as influencing vulnerability or at least misunderstood some of these factors. This is problematic as young adults may be basing their public behaviors on misinformation that may in fact increase, rather than decrease, vulnerability to PSV. The findings from this study have implications for the design of personal safety programs as well as community-based interventions to reduce vulnerability, the prevalence of PSV, and the negative outcomes associated with PSV, including anxiety and fear of crime. © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060046635"

Amid debates about the role of social media and the internet in mediating sexuality, questions about credible, reliable and objective sources of information have also arisen, particularly in relation to young people's knowledge-seeking. Drawing on theorisations of sexual citizenship, Foucault's notion of the ‘episteme’, and the work of science and technology studies scholar John Law, this article examines a ‘collateral reality’ produced by contemporary demands on young people to source, assess and act on sexual health information. Using interviews with 37 young people living in Australia, the analysis identifies a range of approaches to sexual health-seeking practices, key dynamics in the construction of reliability and fact, and the extent and nature of the accommodations young people report making to navigate incomplete and unreliable information. With the contemporary self increasingly framed through the ability to discern truth from falsehood, reality from fake news, these demands and choices have significant implications for qualification as the proper modern citizen. Accommodating information weaknesses and gaps in sexual health information, we argue, produces what we call contemporary ‘epistemic citizens’; young people explicitly aware of the limits of official knowledges about sex and sexualities, and of the expectation that individual citizens must either content themselves with officially constituted sexual selves or else seek and enact marginal or unofficial alternatives using sources generally denigrated as unreliable. As we will conclude, current forms of sexual health information and related calls for youth literacy operate as a mechanism for generating a specific modern form of epistemic citizenship. Future sexuality education might consider ways to support even more literate, sophisticated epistemic citizens relieved of the responsibility to piece the truth together on their own, and who in turn feel more included. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102626191"

This is due to a tendency to discount troubling information while facing the unknown and counter-argue against information that causes discomfort and fear. This tendency helps humans to maintain hope and well-being. The study aimed to determine if Polish citizens tend to downplay or even deny danger when faced with a death threat. The study comprised 58 adults – 46 females 12 males, aged 21 to 49. The participants were asked to answer 12 questions defining their beliefs and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic threat and its consequences. The subjects gave answers on the 5-point Likert scale, from ""definitely not"" to ""definitely yes"". The findings of the present study show that a considerable number of the participants tend to exhibit an optimistic bias. This is reflected in their direct statements and in the lack of congruence of their opinions. They do feel the threat of becoming ill but also seem to believe it need not affect them personally. They are also relatively optimistic about the outcomes of the pandemic. At the same time, they realize that COVID-19 may lead to severe psychological, neurological, and mental disorders. The study confirmed a tendency to deny the threat that can pose a severe risk to health and psychological well-being. This is a manifestation of an optimism bias that has its roots in the way the human brain works. The participants did express concerns about the future but at the same time hoped that life after the pandemic would return to normal. It reflects a benevolent facet of self-deception since it makes it possible to cope with highly threatening and impossible to control events. © 2021, MEDSPORTPRESS Publishing House.

This kind of challenge to mainstream discourses is a necessary element of proper deliberation. However, due to heuristic information processing and the public concern about disinformation online, readers of comments sections may be inherently skeptical about user comments that counter the views of mainstream media. Consequently, commenters with alternative views may participate in discussions from a position of disadvantage because their contributions are scrutinized particularly critically. Nevertheless, this effect has hitherto not been empirically established. To address this gap, a multifactorial, betweensubjects experimental study (N = 166) was conducted that investigated how participants assess the credibility and argument quality of mediadissonant user comments relative to media-congruent user comments. The findings revealed that media-dissonant user comments are, indeed, disadvantaged in online discussions, as they are assessed as less credible and more poorly argued than media-congruent user comments. Moreover, the findings showed that the higher the participants level of media trust, the worse the assessment of media-dissonant user comments relative to media-congruent user comments.

We conduct an experiment on a representative sample of Americans designed specifically to reveal asymmetries in citizens’ proclivity to endorse false damaging information about political opponents.

How broadcast media stations in Nigeria responded through their coverage is deserving of scholarly attention. How regulatory agencies performed their role during the out of the virus is equally worthy of scholarly attention. Objective: This study assessed COVID-19 coverage by Kano State broadcast media. It also evaluated how the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), an agency saddled with regulating the broadcasting industry, responded in tackling violations during a public health emergency. Methodology: The researchers made use of a mixed-method: content analysis and documentary analysis. Content analysis was used to generate quantitative data, while documentary analysis was used for qualitative data through analysis of the Weekly Monitory Reports (WMRs). Results The paper found that the COVID-19 pandemic was given a third place on public station with 16% coverage and fourth position on a private station with about 15%. On information accuracy, the paper found that there were instances of inaccuracies about the virus as non-experts were severally featured on programmes, thus misleading the public. Conclusion: The paper concludes that Kano broadcasters paid attention to the pandemic but disregarded professionalism in so many instances as inaccuracies and misinformation were reported and acted upon by NBC. It is therefore recommended that NBC should not only amend emergency coverage provisions in the Code but come up with a broadcast policy on disaster and other crises emergencies as an antidote to unprofessional coverage as witnessed in some stations. Unique contribution: The study offered theoretical and practical contribution that explains how broadcasters report health emergency issues in radio stations. Key recommendation: National broadcasting commission should come up with a broadcast policy on disaster and other crises emergencies as a remedy to unprofessional coverage as witnessed in broadcast stations. © 2021, University of Nigeria Department of Mass Communication.

Social media is, however, also considered as a place where “noise” and fake news can be dispensed (e.g., Alexander, 2014, Science and Engineering Ethics, 20(3), 717; Starbird, 2017, https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM17/paper/view/15603). In this paper, we analyse contributions on Wikipedia and Twitter during major crises in France through online ethnographies and semi-structured interviews to investigate their roles in building and sharing information. Wikipedia has often been analysed as a collaborative tool but this approach has underestimated its use in reducing uncertainty in times of crisis. We demonstrate that despite their distinct pace and designs, Twitter and Wikipedia are used with seriousness by citizens in their dissemination of information. We also explain how social media change the landscape of means of communication for official institutions and citizens, and that they can be used in the same way. Finally, we stress the need for official institutions to integrate social media in their practices and interactions with citizens that they involve. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099231347"

However, media consumers usually have a hard time differentiating misinformation from authentic information. There are two explanations for this difficulty, namely lazy reasoning and motivated reasoning. While lazy reasoning suggests that people may feel reluctant to conduct critical reasoning when consuming online information, the motivated reasoning theory points out that individuals are also thinking in alignment with their identities and established viewpoints. A proposed approach to address this issue is adding fact-checking flags in the hope that flags could alert people to information falsehoods and stimulate critical thinking. This study examines the impact of fact-checking flags on media consumers' identification of fake news. Conducting an experiment (n = 717) on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the study finds that experimental participants with different political backgrounds depend heavily on flag-checking results provided by flags. Flags are powerful to influence people's judgments in a way that participants have blind beliefs in flags even if the flag assessments are inaccurate. Furthermore, the study's results indicate that flag assessments made by professional fact-checkers or crowdsourcing are equally influential in shaping participants' identification. These observations provide public and private leaders with suggestions that fact-checking flags can significantly affect media consumers' identification of fake news. However, flags appear to have little ability to promote critical thinking in this experiment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104480121"

This study finds out how the 23 anglophone Sub-Saharan African countries' national health ministries and infectious disease agencies disseminated COVID-19 related information through their social media accounts within the first three months after the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 related qualitative and quantitative data types were collected from the social media accounts of the surveyed national health ministries and agencies for analysis. Over 86% of the African countries had presence on social media; Facebook was the most popular, though Twitter contained more posts. One of the credibility issues that was noticed is that most of the health ministries' and agencies' social media accounts were unverified and access to the social media accounts was not provided on most of their official websites. Information dissemination became more deliberate and increased significantly after the announcement of the fist cases of COVID-19 in the countries under review. Awareness creation, updates and news constituted the major categories of information that were disseminated, mostly in the form of derivative social media information before the announcement of the first COVID-19 case in the surveyed African countries. Campaigns against misinformation were barely undertaken by most of the countries. Strategies used by some countries included the employment of social media influencers and creation of content in local languages. Strategies that include development of health information content that targets different groups in African societies and the inclusion of elderly in the community and religious leaders as non-state actors in health information communication were recommended.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104396160"

This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the epistemic mechanisms at work. It develops a fine-grained framework to model a variety of normative deviances that may take place in enquiry. Through analysing two case studies, it is argued that fake news plays two pivotal roles in shaping epistemic norms operating within science denialism.

It identifies several factors associated with higher or lower compliance with recommended measures of social distancing. This research is part of a 67-country study, titled the International COVID-19 study on Social & Moral Psychology, in which we use a Spanish dataset. Participants were residents in Spain aged 18 or above. The sample comprises 1,090 respondents, weighted to be representative of the Spanish population. Frequencies, correlations, bivariate analysis, and six models based on hierarchical multiple regressions were applied. The main finding is that most Spaniards are compliant with established guidelines of social distance during the pandemic (State of Alarm, before May 2020). Variables associated more with lower levels of compliance with these standards were explored. Six hierarchical multiple regression models found that compliance with social distance measures has a multifactorial explanation (R2 between 20.4 and 49.1%). Sociodemographic factors, personal hygiene patterns, and the interaction between personal hygiene patterns and the support for political measures related to the coronavirus brought significant effects on the regression models. Less compliance was also associated with beliefs in some specific conspiracy theories with regard to COVID-19 or general conspiracy mentality (Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, CMQ), consumption patterns of traditional mass media (television, paper newspapers, magazines, and radio) and modern means to get informed (online digital newspapers, blogs, and social networks), political ideology, vote, trust in institutions, and political identification. Among the future lines of action in preventing the possible outbreak of the virus, we suggest measures to reinforce trust in official information, mainly linked to reducing the influence of disinformation and conspiracy theories parallel to the pandemic. © Copyright © 2021 Gualda, Krouwel, Palacios-Gálvez, Morales-Marente, Rodríguez-Pascual and García-Navarro.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116039971"

A narrator that communicates their experiences of interpersonal violence may rate the seriousness of the incident differently than a rater reading the narrator's text, suggesting that there exist perceptual differences (PD) in severity ratings between the narrator and the rater. We propose that these perceptual differences may depend on whether the narrative is based on physical or psychological violence, and on gender differences. Physical violence may be evaluated as more serious by the receiver of the narrative than by the narrator (Calibration PD), whereas the seriousness of psychological violence may be difficult to convey, leading to a discrepancy in the seriousness ratings between the narrator and the rater (Accuracy PD). In addition, gender stereotypes may influence the seriousness rating (Gender PD), resulting in violence against women being perceived as more serious than the same violence against men. These perceptual differences were investigated in 3 phases using a new experimental procedure. In Phase 1, 113 narrators provided descriptions and seriousness ratings of selfexperienced physical and psychological violence in relationships. In Phase 2, 340 independent raters rated the seriousness of 10 randomly selected narrations from Phase 1. In Phase 3, the genders in the narrations were changed to the opposite gender, and seriousness ratings were collected from 340 different raters. Our results confirmed the hypothesized perceptual differences. Violence to male victims was considerably more likely to be seen as severe when the raters were misled to believe the victim was a woman. We propose that these data provide practical guidelines for how to deal with misinformation in the communication of violence. The data also show that mean values and the confidence of such severity ratings need to be adjusted for several factors, such as whether it is self-experienced or communicated, the type of violence, and the gender of the victims and raters.  © 2021 Sikström et al.

A recent wave of empirical research focuses on factors that explain why people fall for the so-called fake news. In this scoping review, we summarize the results of experimental studies that test different predictors of individuals’ belief in misinformation. Methods The review is based on a synthetic analysis of 26 scholarly articles. The authors developed and applied a search protocol to two academic databases, Scopus and Web of Science. The sample included experimental studies that test factors influencing users’ ability to recognize fake news, their likelihood to trust it or intention to engage with such content. Relying on scoping review methodology, the authors then collated and summarized the available evidence. Results The study identifies three broad groups of factors contributing to individuals’ belief in fake news. Firstly, message characteristics—such as belief consistency and presentation cues—can drive people’s belief in misinformation. Secondly, susceptibility to fake news can be determined by individual factors including people’s cognitive styles, predispositions, and differences in news and information literacy. Finally, accuracy-promoting interventions such as warnings or nudges priming individuals to think about information veracity can impact judgements about fake news credibility. Evidence suggests that inoculation-type interventions can be both scalable and effective. We note that study results could be partly driven by design choices such as selection of stimuli and outcome measurement. Conclusions We call for expanding the scope and diversifying designs of empirical investigations of people’s susceptibility to false information online. We recommend examining digital platforms beyond Facebook, using more diverse formats of stimulus material and adding a comparative angle to fake news research. © 2021 Bryanov, Vziatysheva.

Research has focused on beliefs about narrow sets of claims never intended to capture the richness of the political information environment. Furthermore, factors contributing to this performance gap remain unclear. We generated an unique longitudinal dataset combining social media engagement data and a 12-wave panel study of Americans’ political knowledge about high-profile news over 6 months. Results confirm that conservatives have lower sensitivity than liberals, performing worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods. This is partially explained by the fact that the most widely shared falsehoods tend to promote conservative positions, while corresponding truths typically favor liberals. The problem is exacerbated by liberals’ tendency to experience bigger improvements in sensitivity than conservatives as the proportion of partisan news increases. These results underscore the importance of reducing the supply of right-leaning misinformation.

We aim to examine the relationship between exposure to and trust in COVID-19 news (from Television, social media, interpersonal communication) and information sources (healthcare experts, government, clerics) and belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, as well as critical verification practices before posting on social media. Methods We use a cross-sectional researcher-administered phone survey of adults living in Lebanon between March 27 and April 23, 2020. Results The sample included 56.1% men and 43.9% women, 37.9% with a university degree, 63.0% older than 30, and 7% with media literacy training. Those who trust COVID-19 news from social media [95%CI:(1.05-1.52)] and interpersonal communication [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)], and those who trust information from clerics [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)] were more likely to believe in COVID-19 myths and false information. University graduates [95%CI:(0.25-0.51)] and those who trust information from government [95%CI:(0.65-0.89] were less likely to believe in myths and false information. Those who believe in COVID-19 myths and false information [95%CI:(0.25-0.70)] were less likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Only those who underwent media literacy training [95%CI:(1.24-6.55)] were more likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Conclusion Higher education and trust in information from government contributed to decreasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information. Trust in news from social media, interpersonal communication and clerics contributed to increasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, which in turn contributed to less critical social media posting practices, thereby exacerbated the infodemic. Media literacy training contributed to increasing critical social media posting practices, thereby played a role in mitigating the infodemic. Copyright:  © 2021 Melki et al.

Navigating informational environments populated by fake news requires the cultivation of epistemic routines that reduce our exposure to misleading and deceptive information, while at the same time continuing to allow us to partake in the collective growth of knowledge. Shifting the focus to epistemic routines steers a middle path between two frequently encountered dichotomous responses to the problem of fake news: viz., between emphasizing the individual’s responsibility to ‘think critically and check one’s sources’ and advocating technological tweaks (such as automated fact-checking). While epistemic agents ought to be held responsible for the epistemic routines they commit themselves to, there is also a collective need for making the predictable effects of such choices transparent to individuals, wherever technologically possible. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108674118"

This disease, which has morphed into a global pandemic, has mobilized outrageous outpouring action worldwide. Despite international and local media attention coupled with overwhelming new facts replete with misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 from many channels; including interpersonal and social media, efforts to scale up control measures have yielded mixed results. The government and Kenyan media have reported several cases in which the public and leaders flouted these measures thus putting themselves at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The overarching question is: does fear-arousing communication really matter in behaviour change particularly during a global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19? This qualitative study therefore examined the effects of COVID-19 messages on health behaviour change among residents living in the Municipality of Busia, one of the towns that have recorded the highest incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases as informed by the Extended Parallel Process and Health Belief behavioural change models. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to establish threat and coping appraisal as a result of COVID-19 messages received from different sources. The study employed a risk behaviour diagnosis assessment that focused on two components of health risk messages, that is, threat and recommended response that addresses efficacy issues. This study found out that despite universal knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods, perceived threat especially perceived vulnerability to the virus was low due to misinformation, disinformation and disjointed communication. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107657528"

The present study examined whether personality factors and news consumption predict an individual's political news discernment. Participants (N = 353) judged the accuracy of true and false political news headlines, completed a personality inventory, and reported how many hours they obtained political news from various sources in a typical week. Regression analyses revealed that greater levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, open-mindedness, lower levels of extraversion, and fewer hours of news consumption were related to better news discernment. Participants also showed a bias toward headlines consistent with their self-reported political ideology, and this bias was related to consumption of ideologically biased news sources. These results extend those that have identified individual differences in news discernment, demonstrating that personality factors and news consumption are related to the ability to discern between true and false political news. © 2021 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100008998"

Should democratic societies worry about misinformation? If so, is it possible and desirable for them to control its spread by regulating it? This chapter offers an answer to these questions. First, I propose a definition of misinformation and explain how it proliferates in online contexts. Second, I consider four reasons to worry about misinformation by discussing its likely impact on people’s political opinions, emotions, physical safety and personal autonomy. Third, I assess three strategies for regulating misinformation-individual self-regulation, platform-based innovations and governmental action-and suggest that the most effective ones are those that spare human agents from having to successively review individual pieces of content. © 2021 selection and editorial matter Étienne Brown.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108674517"

Yet, little work explores the correlates of misperceptions in varying contexts – that is, how do factors such as group affiliations, media exposure, and lived experiences correlate with the number of misperceptions people hold? We address these questions by investigating misperceptions about COVID-19, focusing on the role of racial/ethnic, religious, and partisan groups. Using a large survey, we find the number of correct beliefs held by individuals far dwarfs the number of misperceptions. When it comes to misperceptions, we find that minorities, those with high levels of religiosity, and those with strong partisan identities – across parties – hold a substantially greater number of misperceptions than those with contrasting group affiliations. Moreover, we show other variables (e.g., social media usage, number of COVID-19 cases in one’s county) do not have such strong relationships with misperceptions, and the group-level results do not reflect acquiescence to believing any information regardless of its truth value. Our results accentuate the importance of studying group-level misperceptions on other scientific and political issues and developing targeted interventions for these groups. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107290049"

The advances in artificial intelligence which allow automated fact-checking (AFC) initiatives to be created help detect falsehoods, but they do not eliminate the need for human intervention. On the contrary, information professionals are necessary, and their functions increasingly include procedures such as mediating in videos and images. This study analyses the evolution of verification routines in audiovisual journalism and how new techniques have influenced the perception of trustworthiness and the reorganization of the television newsroom by allowing content from outside the media’s own newsroom. To do so, it combines a method that examines the main literature on verification processes and compares it with the procedure used by Al Jazeera. In this regard, an exploration was conducted out based on participant observation in this international TV channel via interaction with journalists and heads of the corporation. The results indicate that advances in verification procedures make it possible to introduce visual material from the social media into the corporation’s common news topics contributing to the transition from the traditional newsroom to the cloud structure and the inclusion of new audiences. These changes affect journalistic routines in a profession which has no longer been in-person for some time, in which correspondents coexist with journalists working in virtual mobility, seeking and receiving images in and from the social media. © 2021.

This perception of conflict has increased in recent years, associated with a viral spread of partial and biased information through social media and despite limited empirical support for these assertions. Here, we highlight that magnifying infrequent events of livestock being injured by vultures through publically shared videos or biased news items negatively impact efforts to conserve threatened populations of avian scavengers. We encourage environmental agencies, researchers, and practitioners to evaluate the reliability, frequency, and context of reports of vulture predation, weighing those results against the diverse and valuable contributions of vultures to environmental health and human well-being. We also encourage the development of awareness campaigns and improved livestock management practices, including commonly available nonlethal deterrence strategies, if needed.

I find that beliefs about conspiracy theories are more correlated than the values associated with established political ideologies, and that conspiracy beliefs and scepticism about the pandemic are best explained by belief in unrelated political and medical conspiracy theories. No other demographic or attitudinal variable has such a strong influence, and the results are robust to different statistical specifications. In comparison, the effect of ideology measured by left-right self-placement is rather negligible and further moderated by trust in government. The results have implications for the strategies aimed at fighting disinformation during public health emergencies. © 2021 The Authors.

The risk of misguided trust comes from the fact that re-posting is a kind of credentialing; as a new kind of speech-act, re-posting does not yet have established norms and so runs an additional risk of “bent credentialing.” This chapter proposes that other-regarding epistemic virtues can help us mitigate the epistemic risks that come with re-posting-specifically the virtue of epistemic trustworthiness. It further considers how an epistemically trustworthy person should regulate her re-posting behavior in light of the psychological evidence that retracting false beliefs is far more difficult than might be supposed. Behaving in an epistemically trustworthy way requires being responsive to the real risks that our actions expose others to, as well as recognizing the real ways that others depend on us. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113463664"

The chapter briefly reviews approaches to visual ethics theory, renews definitions of visual journalist and visual journalism, assesses the state of visual journalism, and recommends that visual journalists ground their professional ethics in fulfilling their roles as human beings with vulnerabilities and strengths, seers who are compelled to witness and document, and reporters who feel a responsibility to pursue and communicate the best truth they can discern. Photographic examples manifesting aspects of integrated visual ethics are included. The chapter argues that increasing diversity among visual storytellers, practicing engaged journalism, and applying visual ethics, honed by reflection on conscious and nonconscious ways of perceiving and meaning making, will strengthen visual journalism. This will help meet the challenges of fakery, disinformation, and harmful practices that increasingly undermine both ethical practice and user understanding in the 21st-century media environment. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Lada Trifonova Price, Karen Sanders, and Wendy N.

While the articles aim to correct misinformation, many lapse into sensationalized or patronizing accounts of menstrual beliefs and practices that disregard and, in some cases, even ridicule cultural and religious tradi-tions. Our analysis reveals that many articles reflect the neocolonial trinity of victim, savage, and savior that cast the global North as progressive and the global South as regressive. Through these representations, assumptions of Western superiority, including the untroubled privileging of modernity, are contrasted with “backward” traditions. In particular, these discursive formulations metaphorically cast women and girls as passive victims of their “savage” culture in need of “saviors” who have the authority and the resources to alleviate their suffering. In doing so, the articles largely fail to understand the complex and diverse meanings of menstrual beliefs and practices and to acknowledge women’s and girls’ agency. © 2021 Feminist Formations,.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121341326"

But using social media as a source of news is associated with increased likelihood of being misinformed about important topics, such as COVID-19. The two most popular platforms—Facebook and YouTube—remain relatively understudied in comparison to Twitter, which tends to be used by elites, but less than a quarter of the American public. In this brief research report, we investigate how cognitive reflection can mitigate the potential effects of using Facebook, YouTube and Twitter for news on subsequent conspiracy theory endorsement. To do that, we rely on an original dataset of 1,009 survey responses collected during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, on March 31, 2020. We find that using Facebook and YouTube for news increases conspiracy belief (both general and COVID-19 specific), controlling for cognitive reflection, traditional news media use, use of web-based news media, partisanship, education, age, and income. We also find that the impact of Facebook use on conspiracy belief is moderated by cognitive reflection. Facebook use increases conspiracy belief among those with low cognitive reflection but has no effect among those with moderate levels of cognitive reflection. It might even decrease conspiracy belief among those with the highest levels of cognitive reflection.

In total, we evaluated 22 fact-checks, including two that were tested in all four countries. Fact-checking reduced belief in misinformation, with most effects still apparent more than 2 wk later. A meta-analytic procedure indicates that factchecks reduced belief in misinformation by at least 0.59 points on a 5-point scale.

Evidence from studies on cognitive functions in bilinguals indicates that they might be prone to different types of memory errors compared to monolinguals; however, the effect of language in false memories is still understudied. Source monitoring processes required for proper memory functioning, presumably, rely on inhibitory control, which is also heavily utilized by bilinguals. Moreover, it is suggested that thinking in a second language leads to more systematic and deliberate reasoning. All these results lead to expect that bilinguals are more analytical when processing information in their second language overcoming some memory errors depending on the language of information. To test this hypothesis, we run a classical misinformation experiment with an explicit source monitoring task with a sample of Russian–English bilinguals. The language of the misinformation presentation did not affect the degree of the misinformation effect between the Russian and English languages. Source monitoring demonstrated an overall higher accuracy for attributions to the English source over the Russian source. Furthermore, analysis on incorrect source attributions showed that when participants misattributed the sources of false information (English or Russian narrative), they favored the Russian source over the not presented condition. Taken together, these results imply that high proficiency in the second language does not affect misinformation and that information processing and memory monitoring in bilinguals can differ depending on the language of the information, which seems to lead to some memory errors and not others. © Copyright © 2021 Dolgoarshinnaia and Martin-Luengo.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117154456"

This has important consequences in terms of how anti-science attitudes as well as epistemically questionable beliefs must be interpreted, which has consequences for addressing misinformation. We argue that most people who endorse scientific misinformation are not truly interested in its accuracy, and rather that plausibility at face value often suffices when it is meant to be used for social purposes only.

To address these questions, we conducted an original survey experiment, in which we presented a nationally representative sample of 2,049 Americans living in the United States with facts about immigrants’ English acquisition and immigrants’ impact on crime, jobs, and taxes—four domains with common misperceptions. Three of these factual domains (immigration’s impact on crime, jobs, and taxes) raise overall support for increased immigration.

Study 2 (n=400) found that those who saw fake news - and were told they saw a fake news post - decreased their trust in the news media while those who saw fake news and were not debriefed did not change their perceptions of the news media.

The continued preponderance of neuromyths among educators is of concern, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. Method: Using an adapted questionnaire, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among teachers in a small island developing state in the Caribbean. Results: Two-thirds of the sample were unable to recognise at least 50% of the myths. Regression analysis demonstrated that higher scores in brain knowledge and exposure to prior teacher-training increased belief in neuromyths. On the other hand, specific in-service training pertaining to educational neuroscience improved scores. Conclusion: Neuromyths are prevalent among teachers and appear to inform their teaching practice. Further research needs to be conducted to explore not just the prevalence of these myths but in what ways they may be impacting teaching and learning outcomes in the classroom. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106156571"

In the current study, we investigated who tends to trust what type of mis/information. The data were collected in Norway from a sample of 405 participants during the first wave of COVID-19 in April 2020. We focused on three kinds of belief: the belief that the threat is overrated (COVID-threat skepticism), the belief that the threat is underrated (COVID-threat belief) and belief in misinformation about COVID-19. We studied sociodemographic factors associated with these beliefs and the interplay between attitudes to COVID-19, media consumption and prevention behavior. All three types of belief were associated with distrust in information about COVID-19 provided by traditional media and distrust in the authorities' approach to the pandemic. COVID-threat skepticism was associated with male gender, reduced news consumption since the start of the pandemic and lower levels of precautionary measures. Belief that the COVID-19 threat is underrated was associated with younger age, left-wing political orientation, increased news consumption during the pandemic and increased precautionary behavior. Consistent with the assumptions of the theory of planned behavior, individual beliefs about the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat predicted the extent to which individual participants adopted precautionary health measures. Both COVID-threat skepticism and COVID-threat belief were associated with endorsement of misinformation on COVID-19. Participants who endorsed misinformation tended to: have lower levels of education; be male; show decreased news consumption; have high Internet use and high trust in information provided by social media. Additionally, they tended to endorse multiple misinformation stories simultaneously, even when they were mutually contradictory. The strongest predictor for low compliance with precautionary measures was endorsement of a belief that the COVID-19 threat is overrated which at the time of the data collection was held also by some experts and featured in traditional media. The findings stress the importance of consistency of communication in situations of a public health threat. © Copyright © 2021 Filkuková, Ayton, Rand and Langguth.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109378847"

Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that have been found to work in the increasingly polarized climate. This project examines whether irrelevant factors, or incidental happiness more specifically, have the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or “carryover effect”). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in conspiracy theories and impeding individual ability to recognize deep fakes. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 3611) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward political outgroups and hostility toward various divisive social groups, and also on endorsement of conspiracy theories and beliefs that a deep fake was real. Two additional studies in the US and Poland (total N = 2220), also induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. These findings, which emerged uniformly in three different countries, among different partisan and ideological groups, and for those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the stability of outgroup attitudes in contemporary America and other countries. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103054388"

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been accompanied by what the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a “massive infodemic.” Fake news covering all aspects of the pandemic spread rapidly through social media, creating confusion and disinformation. This paper reports on an empirical study carried out during the lockdown in Spain (March–May 2020) with a group of secondary students (N = 20) engaged in diverse online activities that required them to practice critical thinking and argumentation for dealing with coronavirus information and disinformation. The main goal is to examine students’ competence at engaging in argumentation as critical assessment in this context. Discourse analysis allows for the exploration of the arguments and criteria applied by students to assess COVID-19 news headlines. The results show that participants were capable of identifying true and false headlines and assessing the credibility of headlines by appealing to different criteria, although most arguments were coded as needing only a basic epistemic level of assessment, and only a few appealed to the criterion of scientific procedure when assessing the headlines. © Copyright © 2021 Puig, Blanco-Anaya and Pérez-Maceira.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106001218"

The main goal of this paper was to identify the levels of credibility that Spanish citizens assign to political news in the online environment. A national survey (n = 1669) was designed to assess how the news format affected credibility and likelihood of sharing. Four different news formats were assessed, two of them linked to traditional media (digital newspapers and digital television) and two to social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). Four experimental groups assigned a credibility score and a likelihood of sharing score to four different political news items presented in the aforementioned digital formats. The comparison between the mean credibility scores assigned to the same news item presented in different formats showed significant differences among groups, as did the likelihood of sharing the news. News items shown in a traditional media format, especially digital television, were assigned more credibility than news presented in a social media format, and participants were also more likely to share the former, revealing a more cautious attitude towards social media as a source of news. © 2021 by the authors.

Uncertainty about the partisan underpinnings of vaccine misinformation acceptance is important, as it could complicate efforts to pursue pro-vaccine health policies. I theorize that Republicans should be more likely to endorse anti-vaccine misinformation, as they tend to express more-negative views toward scientific experts. Across six demographically and nationally representative surveys, I find that—while few Americans think that “anti-vaxxers” are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats—Republican PID is significantly associated with the belief that childhood vaccines can cause autism.

To this end, a nominal group was made with 24 experts who were surveyed, thus generating new indicators of transparency and accountability strategies around sustainability and digitalization.

Facing the worldwide pandemic, academic libraries in various countries are still exploring how to cope with the situation. Little research has been carried out on how academic libraries should systematically promote information literacy education during the pandemic. This study uses 42 academic libraries at the top universities in China as cases for content analysis, focusing on information literacy education via online mini-courses, lectures, and other online teaching methods. The study has found that information literacy education during the pandemic has several characteristics, such as rapid response to information needs, recommending reliable information resources to users, developing and gathering current information on COVID-19 cases, and resisting misinformation and false information. Although libraries act quickly to meet users' needs in this new situation, they are still confronted with some problems, such as insufficient planning, untimely updates, incomplete resources, etc. This study suggests that libraries adopt the following approaches to the development of information literacy education under the new norm of the pandemic: boosting online courses with multi-platform linkage; developing innovative teaching models with online and offline combination; exploring teaching opportunities and expanding teaching content according to new information needs; fighting misinformation. © 2021","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103959391"

A rhetoric system is here defined as a set of interconnected rhetorical elements (beliefs, arguments, commonplaces [loci communes], meanings, and texts) that cohere into a self-organized system that is thoroughly “about” its contexts—meaning that its own boundaries and relations are both constrained and enabled by the contexts in which it exists. Ignorance, as described here, is epistemic management that preserves the boundaries and relations of a rhetoric system, and is a way of dealing with information that runs counter to one’s beliefs. Ignorance is also productive, in that it produces new knowledge that works to make rhetoric systems more resistant to potential destabilization. To elaborate these points, the paper examines discourse about the phenomenon of global climate change, which illustrates how individuals productively counter information as a way of preserving beliefs. As the paper argues, ignorance is neither a cognitive nor epistemological failure, but rather is a result of the dynamic and continuous process of enforcing epistemic and rhetorical boundaries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076000871"

With the sophistication of techniques for developing these counterfeits, it is becoming increasingly difficult to detect whether public appearances or statements by influential people respond to parameters of reality or, on the contrary, are the result of fictitious representations. These synthetic documents, generated by computerized techniques based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), pose serious threats to privacy, in a new scenario in which the risks derived from identity theft are increasing. This study aims to advance the state of the art through the analysis of academic news and through an exhaustive literature review, seeking answers to the following questions, which we understand to be of general interest, from both an economic and a social perspective and in various areas of research. What are deepfakes? Who produces them and what technology supports them? What opportunities do they present? What risks are associated with them? What methods exist to combat them? And framing the study in terms of information theory: is this a revolution or an evolution of fake news? As we know, fake news influences public opinion and is effective in appealing to emotions and modifying behaviours. We can assume that these new audiovisual texts will be tremendously effective in undermining, even more if possible, the credibility of digital media, as well as accelerating the already evident exhaustion of critical thinking. © 2021.

Humans have therefore evolved a suite of psychological mechanisms for the evaluation of speakers and their messages. Here, we test a key hypothesized function of these “epistemic vigilance” mechanisms: the selective remembering of links between speakers and messages that are inconsistent with preexisting beliefs. Across four experiments, participants (N = 707) read stories associated with different contexts, with each story containing concepts that violate core knowledge intuitions (“counterintuitive concepts”) and ordinary concepts. Experiment 1 revealed that after a brief distractor (2 min) participants more accurately attributed counterintuitive concepts to their speakers than ordinary concepts. Experiments 2a and 2b replicated this finding and found that this attribution accuracy advantage also extended to counterintuitive versus ordinary concepts associated with other contextual details—places and dates. Experiment 3 then tested whether this attribution accuracy advantage was more stable over time for speakers than for places. After a short distractor (20 min), there was a counterintuitive versus ordinary concept attribution accuracy advantage for both speakers and places. However, when participants were tested again after a long delay (48 hr), this attribution accuracy advantage more than doubled for speakers but disappeared entirely for places. We discuss the implications of these findings to the set of psychological mechanisms theorized to monitor and evaluate communication to guard our database of beliefs about the world.

By drawing on self-categorization theory, this article re-conceptualizes audiences’ acts of news authentication by considering it not as a one-off activity under the uncontested control of the individual, but as a cycle of collective authentication strategies whereby individual authentication and social validation are entangled in the context-dependent processing of social news. To do this, we unpacked the social dimension of news authentication by looking at the social motivation, strategies, as well as the consequences that support it through a series of focus group discussions in Singapore. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086228437"

We will thus use a semiotic approach based on the starting hypothesis that digital interfaces shape our belief systems through a discursive framing of content to which they give access. By analyzing two case studies, we will argue that the transparency of interfaces appears to recall the notion of ""mechanical objectivity""and thus refashion the reliability of the archives.

These studies often present participants with news content that varies on relevant dimensions (e.g., true v. false, politically consistent v. inconsistent, etc.) and ask participants to make judgments (e.g., accuracy) or choices (e.g., whether they would share it on social media). This guide is intended to help researchers navigate the unique challenges that come with this type of research. Principle among these issues is that the nature of news content that is being spread on social media (whether it is false, misleading, or true) is a moving target that reflects current affairs in the context of interest. Steps are required if one wishes to present stimuli that allow generalization from the study to the real-world phenomenon of online misinformation. Furthermore, the selection of content to include can be highly consequential for the study's outcome, and researcher biases can easily result in biases in a stimulus set. As such, we advocate for pretesting materials and, to this end, report our own pretest of 224 recent true and false news headlines, both relating to U.S. political issues and the COVID-19 pandemic. These headlines may be of use in the short term, but, more importantly, the pretest is intended to serve as an example of best practices in a quickly evolving area of research. © 2021 University of California Press.

We test this argument with a unique combination of survey and event data from the Coalition air campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in contemporary Iraq, finding support for our theory.

The disinformation campaigns mounted by Russian agents around the United States’ 2016 election illustrate the use of anti-deliberative tactics, including corrosive falsehoods, moral denigration, and unjustified inclusion. We further propose that these tactics might contribute to the system-level anti-deliberative properties of epistemic cynicism, techno-affective polarization, and pervasive inauthenticity. These harms undermine a polity’s capacity to engage in communication characterized by the use of facts and logic, moral respect, and democratic inclusion.

This article argues for an ""electoral ecosystem""approach to combatting the threat of foreign intervention in elections. Under an electoral ecosystem approach, the electoral system is viewed as an interconnected network of institutions, processes, and actors, all of which must coordinate together to ensure electoral effectiveness and legitimacy. An electoral ecosystem is comprised of multiple institutions and actors, including governments, political parties, voters, third parties, online platforms, and electoral management bodies. Given the interdependence and interconnected nature of an electoral system, there are multiple points of vulnerability that must be defended. An electoral ecosystem approach does not depend on any one single line of defense but instead relies on a multiplicity of strategies that protect the institutions and individuals that comprise the ecosystem. To further explore the electoral ecosystem approach, this article focuses on Canada's response to foreign interference in elections. The ecosystem approach consists of three principal strategies. The first strategy involves a set of new campaign finance regulations which directly prevents the influence of foreign individuals and groups on the election. The second strategy consists of new measures to reduce disinformation and to lessen its distorting impact on democratic discourse. To the extent that foreign election interference takes place through social media, efforts to reduce disinformation will also reduce the impact of foreign interference. The third strategy involves strengthening Canadian cybersecurity. A number of steps have been taken recently, including the coordination of Canada's security agencies and the adoption of new measures to prevent computer hacking and privacy intrusions. These three strategies, and the multiple measures within each, provide protection across the electoral ecosystem. © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102930409"

This law can for the first time in the history of the country criminalize journalists for disseminating false information and set up new forms of control over information in the future. This is not the first attempt by the country’s leadership to bring all actors into a legal and civilized channel (the draft law On the Media No. 2693, which is also under consideration by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, stands for the systematic policy of reforming the media sector of Ukraine). The research is aimed at defining the place of the draft law in the reformed system of legal regulation of the Ukrainian media, from the position of the academic community neutral to the process. For this purpose, a detailed content analysis was conducted, which showed that, in the long run, the ambiguous wording of the adopted document at the stage of its enforcement, leaves the regulatory authorities free to interpret it depending on the interests of the parties, rather than on the language of the law. Considering the risks associated with the entry into force of this draft, one should also take into account the ambiguous reaction of the local and international media community. The article may be considered as a contribution to the development of criteria for a comprehensive scientific analysis of the legislation regulating the activity of media structures. © 2021 Authors.

Further, it investigates how these receivers perceive the social image of the people who share fake news. Finally, this study examines how brand strength and valence and credibility of fake content influence consumer’s word-of-mouth recommendations, purchase intentions and attitude toward the brand. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments were conducted to test the hypotheses. The data was analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance and PROCESS techniques. Findings: Findings indicate that people prefer to receive and share relevant content, even if it is fake. Sharing fake news conveys the sender’s sociability but also creates a negative perception of narcissism. Individuals are more likely to recommend a brand if the fake news is perceived as credible and positive (vs negative). Finally, brand-strength can help brands to negate the harmful effects of fake news. Research limitations/implications: Future research can explore the role of group dynamics, tie-strength and media richness (text, image and videos) in the dispersion of fake news and its impact on brands. Practical implications: Marketers should communicate and educate consumers that sharing fake content can harm their social image, which can reduce information dispersion. Marketers should also improve brand-strength that can protect the brand against the adverse impact of fake news. Originality/value: This study contributes to the emerging literature on fake news by studying the impact of fake news on consumer intentions and attitudes toward the brand, which are critical for the success of any brand. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113421794"

How will citizens react when the initial “fake news” is verified to be real? What are the consequences of false government denials on government credibility and citizen satisfaction? Using a survey experiment in China and a follow-up survey, we find that citizens can be persuaded by the authorities’ denials and reduce their belief in a piece of news that has been declared “fake.” But when the denied news turns out to be real, citizens will reduce their belief not only in the denial at hand but also in a similar denial in the future and reduce their satisfaction with the government. Thus, false denials have both immediate and lasting effects on government credibility and can erode citizen satisfaction with the government. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091036820"

The present study critically evaluates the effectiveness of five approaches to reducing conspiratorial belief, through experiments (N=607) conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results demonstrate that the content-based methods of counter conspiracy theory can partly mitigate conspiratorial belief. Specifically, the science- and fact-focused corrections were able to effectively mitigate conspiracy beliefs, whereas media literacy and inoculation strategies did not produce significant change. More crucially, our findings illustrate that both audience-focused methods, which involve decoding the myth of conspiracy theory and re-imagining intergroup relationships, were effective in reducing the cognitive acceptance of conspiracy theory. Building on these insights, this study contributes to a systematic examination of different epistemic means to influence (or not) conspiracy beliefs-an urgent task in the face of the infodemic threat apparent both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112850368"

Perceptive people look at post-truth as pre-fascism. It prepares the ground for absolute power. When governments use their propaganda machinery for handing out sensational reports, unverified statistics-making unproven claims, unrealizable promises, and unjustifiable allegations-the entire society is held to ransom. Fake news can appear not only in the form of political deception but also of scientific facts or historic data to prop up the dominant clique’s ideology or interests. Today, society is getting tired of chaotic democracy, vociferous street demonstrations that lead to no conclusions, competitive corruption between parties that only strengthens each other, clash of sectarian political lobbies, indecisive leaders, etc. No wonder people long for a “Strong "". There are many countries in the world today where the educational system is manipulated by the ruling dispensation, information controlled, self-censorship demanded, political institutions weakened, and the dominant culture imposed. Indeed, individual citizens and alert groups ought to observe, study, and judge for themselves what news is from reliable sources and what is not, and how false information is passed round by interested parties, sectarian groups, social and religious radicals to further their own interests, and the ruling clique to strengthen their power.

The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the “infodemic” of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways.

Political identity, education and other demographic variables explain only part of the differences between people in their susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. This paper focuses on another explanation: epistemic vice. Epistemic vices are character traits that interfere with acquiring, maintaining, and transmitting knowledge. If the basic assumption of vice epistemology is right, then people with epistemic vices such as indifference to the truth or rigidity in their belief structures will tend to be more susceptible to believing COVID-19 misinformation. We carried out an observational study (US adult sample, n = 998) in which we measured the level of epistemic vice of participants using a novel Epistemic Vice Scale that captures features of the current competing analyses of epistemic vice in the literature. We also asked participants questions eliciting the extent to which they subscribe to myths and misinformation about COVID-19. We find overwhelming evidence to the effect that epistemic vice is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation. In fact, the association turns out to be stronger than with political identity, educational attainment, scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test, personality, dogmatism, and need for closure. We conclude that this offers evidence in favor of the empirical presuppositions of vice epistemology.  © The Author(s), 2021.

It has been evident that few media outlets and professionals tend to draw conflicting news about COVID-19 from social media feeds, which are largely produced by common citizens with mostly no journalism training. This pervasive use makes social media key sources to scores of media outlets for news, whether it is related to COVID-19 or public affairs issues, even though it is susceptible to torrents of credibility and accuracy issues. As a result, of the overwhelming spread of fake news on coronavirus, which is contributing to framing events from several angles, media professionals are now obliged to track and vet information circulating on social media. Due to the scale of disinformation spreading on the Web, it has become imperative that the credibility and accuracy of news is thoroughly verified. Media organizations have already been putting in place various mechanisms to monitor false news. This article will attempt to identify and assess these monitoring efforts in the Arab world. For this purpose, I have put together a list of Arab observatories launched on the internet in order to monitor fake news circulating in relation to COVID-19, and to discuss their methods of monitoring work, in the context of mobilization carried out by governments and many organizations such as the World Health Organization. This article is pinned down on social responsibility approach which helps pave the way the different propositions to combat fake news and avoid abuses in social media uses. This article proposes an evaluation of the monitoring initiative viaa-vis fake news and proposes a set of guidelines for improving the work of such monitoring bodies. Hence, this research reveals that social media outlets have diversified their goals to match the power of the conventional media in disseminating information and bringing up issues for debate. However, in the light of the framework of social responsibility, social media actors have to constantly develop a set of ethical practices to be observed by users, establish codes of conduct regulating content production, and lay down a code of integrity to assure accuracy in news and information transmission. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

Likewise, electrophysiological signatures of slow and controlled evaluative brain activity revealed a dominant influence of emotional headline contents regardless of credibility. Modulations of earlier brain responses associated with arousal and reflexive emotional processing show an effect of negative news and suggest that distrusted sources may even enhance the impact of negative headlines.

In the treatment conditions, “true” and “false” tags appeared before, during, or after participants read each headline. Participants in a control condition received no information about veracity.

Dominant models of epistemic bubbles explain some of their features, but fail to account for their recent spread, increasing extremity, and asymmetrical distribution across political groups. The rise of populist authoritarian politics explains these recent changes. I propose two models of how populism creates epistemic bubbles or their functional equivalents: (1) by promulgating biased group norms of information processing; and (2) by replacing empirically-oriented policy discourse with an identity-expressive discourse of group status competition. Each model recommends different strategies for popping epistemic bubbles. My analysis suggests that social epistemology needs to get more social, by modeling cognitive biases as operating collectively and outside people’s heads, via group epistemic and discursive norms. © the several contributors 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112340021"

On the basis of a critical reflection on research in media studies and in cognitive science, meant to assess whether, and how far, fake news can switch voting behavior, I shall argue that the effect of fake news in this respect is much less than usually assumed. The danger of fake news for democratic politics that rather lies in the increase of political polarization and hostile attitudes in the public sphere as well as the blurring of truth and falsity in public discourse that has caused a widespread mistrust of politics and of experts in general. In the first section, I shall discuss the disinformation induced by fake news. I shall set apart political fake news from other kinds of fake news, for, in the first case, the influence of social media information seems to run along partisan affiliations, either reinforcing preexistent beliefs in the case of favorable content or being dismissed as fake in the case of adverse content. In the second section, I shall examine what I take to be the main source of distorted political information, namely motivated reasoning, and more specifically that form of motivated reasoning induced by ideological beliefs and partisan affiliations. In the third section, I shall consider the variations in the susceptibility to political fake news in partisans and nonpartisans alike. I shall conclude by stating that, even if fake news does not especially affect electoral turnout, the pollution of the public sphere seems to be the most worrying effect of fake news and future research should focus on these aspects specifically. © 2021, Tipolito Subalpina.

This in turn (3) highlighted the tensions between cities and their respective newspapers. Journalists writing for these papers—in particular, in Vicksburg and New Orleans—penned accusations that reporters in the other city either sensationalized or understated the impact of the epidemic, thereby undermining their own ability to protect their hometowns from threats to public health, economic stability, and regional or national reputations. At times, multiple papers from the same city argued about the accuracy of each other’s epidemic coverage. Although public health, science, medicine, and journalism have developed tremendously since 1878, this story reminds us of the significance of local news and cooperation between citizens and journalists when facing contemporary health crises, such as COVID-19.

Firstly, we give an overview on how the Greek-Hellenistic imperialism provoked apocalypticism as a way of resistance to colonization (e.g. Egypt and Judah). Secondly, we show how the early African apocalypticism is very similar to that of the Ancient Near East. In many African countries, colonization was perceived as an apocalyptic phenomenon. Within this mind-set, apocalypticism became an information system that speculated about the true nature of time, space and being. This information system also gave solutions to how the coming destruction could be ameliorated by human ingenuity and actions. This ideology informed liberation movements like the Chimurenga and others. Thirdly, we analyse how the anti-imperial apocalypticism was calmed by an imperially formatted Christianity. Elements like the belief in heaven created a naïve world-denying attitude: ‘this world is not my home I am just passing through.’ Within the African apocalyptic mind-set, COVID-19 is an ambivalent phenomenon. Initially, it was perceived as God’s judgment on the ungodly West, but perceptions quickly changed as it later ravaged Africa. Many government officials voiced that COVID-19 is a well-promoted hoax by fake news of prominent western media houses. Some dismissed the existence of the pandemic while others declared that the vaccine is the dreaded 666 mark of ‘the beast’ or the protective masks were blamed the masks of ‘the beast’. COVID-19 apocalypticism thus can be understood as an anti-modern, xenophobic way of constructing identity. © 2021.

However, only little is known about the misclassification of true news as fake, although it appears equally important to correctly identify fake and true news for unbiased belief formation. An online study with N = 530 (n = 396 men) participants was conducted to investigate performance in a Fake and True News Test in association with i) performance in fluid and crystallized intelligence tests and the Big Five Inventory, and ii) news consumption as a mediating variable between individual characteristics and performance in the Fake and True News Test. Results showed that fluid intelligence was negatively correlated with believing fake news (the association did not remain significant in a regression model); crystallized intelligence was negatively linked to misclassifying true news. Extraversion was negatively and crystallized intelligence was positively associated with fake and true news discernment. The number of different news sources consumed correlated negatively with misclassifying true news and positively with fake and true news discernment. However, no meaningful mediation effect of news consumption was observed. Only interpersonal trust was negatively related to misclassifying both fake and true news as well as positively related to news discernment.

The project, which has been developed by the authors of this viewpoint, is implemented through theoretical– practical workshops aimed at public and private secondary pupils (academic years 2018–19, 2019–20 and 2020–21), based around training in fake news detection strategies and online fact-checking tools for students and teachers. This viewpoint describes and reflects on this initiative, conducted in 36 training sessions with schoolchildren aged 14–16 years attending schools in Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona. The workshops are based on van Dijk’s media literacy model, with a special focus on the ‘informational skills’ dimension. The amount of information available through all kinds of online platforms implies an extra effort in select-ing, evaluating and sharing information, and the workshop focuses on this process through seven steps: suspect, read/listen/watch carefully, check the source, look for other reliable sources, check the data/location, be self-conscious of your bias and decide whether to share the information or not. The QNTLC sessions teach and train these skills combining gamification strategies – online quiz, verification chal-lenges, ‘infoxication’ dynamics in the class – as well as through a public delibera-tion among students. Participants’ engagement and stakeholders’ interest in the programme suggest that this kind of training is important or, at least, attract the attention of these collectives in the Spanish context. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Viewpoints.

Learning to handle this environment is essential to maintain critical and informed citizens, particularly among the youngest. This research focuses on the opinion about the content that circulates on social networks and the credibility and trust generated. Methodology: a correlational study is run with 935 participants between 18 and 25 years old selected by snowball process that filled an online questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis identifies four dimensions that assess the implications of social media. Results and Discussion: those who are more identified with the controversial vision and lack of objectivity of social media show a higher level of trust in the sources of information on the Internet and lower trust levels in the news that appears in the profile feed. Sharing the vision of social media as an alternative channel to be informed is associated with giving greater confidence to the news content of social media, to the recommendations of unknown users and influencers. Conclusions: young people have a vision of the implication of social media that reflects some of the problems that have arisen in this space of interaction. The recommendation is to maintain a critical attitude towards social media content. © 2021, University of La Laguna.

Studies based on experiments show that when people encounter aggregate cues, such as opinion polls, and exemplar cues, such as ‘vox pop’ interviews, they gain a sense of public consensus about policy issues and political actors, even if the cues are not representative of public opinion. Social media have given rise to new public opinion cues, such as ‘likes’, shares, and comments, and these have even weaker links with real public opinion. However, these new cues activate powerful social endorsement affordances and, as a result, may influence perceptions of public opinion. We trace the effects of these new cues in the hybrid media system and explain how they constrain professional journalism’s role as mediator of the public’s attitudes. Social media cues can influence audiences’ perceptions of news and politics. Journalists’ use of social media cues in their reporting can also influence audience perceptions of politics and of journalism itself. The production and circulation of cues can be skewed by disinformation campaigns based on orchestrated botnets and commenting sock puppets. Due to their influence, fabricated public opinion cues on social media can render social media users, news audiences and journalists more vulnerable to manipulation and deception. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, James Morrison, Jen Birks and Mike Berry.","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131491016"

A key strategy in the EPRP is to mobilize national resources and put in place strategies for improved risk and behavioral change communication. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised on social media about COVID-19 misinformation and misconceptions. This study used social media content to determine the types, forms and the effects of the myths, misconceptions and misinformation in Ghana's COVID-19 containment. Method: The study was conducted in three phases involving the use of both primary and secondary data. Review of social media information on COVID-19 was done. This was complemented with document review and interviews with key stakeholders with expertise in the management of public health emergencies and mass communication experts (N = 18). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo 12. Results: The study showed a changing pattern in the misconceptions and misinformation about COVID-19. Initially myths were largely on causes and vulnerability. It was widely speculated that black people had some immunity against COVID-19. Also, the condition was perceived to cause severe disease among the elderly. These misconceptions served as risk attenuators among Ghanaians, especially the younger generation. As the infection evolved in the country, another misconception emerged that the hot climate in Africa inhibited viral replication and transmission only to be followed by speculations and conjectures that COVID-19 was being used as a biological weapon to target developed economics. For the management of COVID-19, the use of local remedies such as Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and herbal preparation also emerged. Myths about the efficacy of locally manufactured gin (akpeteshie) and hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis led to abuse of such substances. Interview segments revealed the use of myths to propagate political agenda in the country. Conclusion: The study concludes that COVID-19 misconceptions and misinformation are widespread and cover the course of the condition. These myths necessitate culturally sensitive health communication strategies that take into account local perceptions of COVID-19 in order to tackle the circulation of misconceived messages about the pandemic in Ghana. © Tabong and Segtub.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118139773"

We identified a group of respondents who refused categorically to believe in the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia - COVID-19 dissidents. They not only deny the pandemic but also refuse to comply with pandemic rules and restrictions. Then, based on seven national samples covering a combined total of 40, 700 people in all regions of Russia, we established a link between the level of distrust of the public sector and the level of COVID-19 dissidence by means of linear regression. We proved that COVID-19 dissidents do not trust official statistics and believe in low infection risks. They provide low evaluation of the medical aid quality which leads to underestimation of the risk of being infected and COVID-19 compliance rules. We recommend governments consider restoring citizens' trust as one of the priorities in fighting the pandemic, alongside battling misinformation that feeds conspiracy beliefs.

In this chapter, we investigate the emerging online practices of science communicators in Canada. We focus on how science communicators are adapting and thriving online and what they value. Using social media research tools and survey data gathered from communicators, we found that social media communicators of science in Canada are focused in areas including conservation advocacy, women in STEM, science-art and combating misinformation. Social media communicators of science were more likely to be involved in informal community networks rather than professional associations. While there were similarities, we found significant differences in emerging practices in Quebec and other provinces in Canada, and in the main representations and motivations of communicators. Popular social media communicators in Quebec tended to be associated with traditional science media platforms. Social media communicators in our study continued to value engagement, relevance, writing quality, accessibility and accuracy. However, some were also motivated to promote inclusivity, to represent diversity and to overcome marginalization through their communication. It will be important for researchers and professional organizations to better understand the role of online networks and networking for professional development and support for emerging science communication practices.

To get the data, I searched all the state-run tweets sent by Arab trolls (78,274,588 in total), and I used Cedar, Canada's supercomputer, to extract all the videos and images associated with references to Khashoggi. In addition, I searched Twitter's full data archive to cross-examine some of the hashtag campaigns that were launched the day Khashoggi disappeared and afterwards. Finally, I used CrowdTangle to understand whether some of these hashtags were also used on Facebook and Instagram. I present here evidence that just a few hours after Khashoggi's disappearance in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Saudi trolls started a coordinated disinformation campaign against him to frame him as a terrorist, foreign agent for Qatar and Turkey, liar.... etc. The trolls also emphasized that the whole story of his disappearance and killing is a fabrication or a staged play orchestrated by Turkey and Qatar. The campaign also targeted his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, alleging she was a spy, while later they cast doubt about her claims. Some of these campaigns were launched a few months after Khashoggi's death. Theoretically, I argue that state-run disinformation campaigns need to incorporate the dimension of intended effect. In this case study, the goal is to tarnish the reputation and credibility of Khashoggi, even after he died, in an attempt to discredit his claims and political cause, influence different audiences especially the Saudi public, and potentially reduce sympathy towards him. © 2021 Ahmed Al-Rawi, published by De Gruyter.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116166342"

Spreading dezinformatsiya has a long history, but today it is done with a volume and accuracy that has left the targeted societies deeply destabilized as facts and events become sharply contested among citizens. This chapter is a descriptive work illustrating the essential components of this activity and draws three important conclusions. First, because disinformation aims to twist the truth in subtle ways when key facts remain secret and unavailable, exposing an operation becomes a tedious and difficult task. Second, the new digital world has opened the door to omnipresent operations that occur below the threshold of armed conflict and are accelerated exponentially by big data warehousing and algorithms that allow individualized targeting during an election cycle. Third, when disinformation operations disrupt the flow of information during a political campaign, the candidates involved and the process itself emerge with a dangerously eroded legitimacy. With a view to fill in critical missing data, the chapter ends with a clarion call to allow access for social scientists to study in detail of what is happening in the opaque public square of online social media wherever more political understanding is being fashioned. © Duncan B.

The credibility of news media outlets as our gatekeepers and first form of resistance to polluted information is increasingly questioned. Scientific research indicates that the quality of news offerings from news media outlets would benefit by triangulating news stories with a more diverse set of offerings and, in the process, build journalists’ trust or otherwise in the sources of these offerings. Without the network effects of the Internet, false or incorrect information probably would not be such a successful phenomenon. Public opinion is quick to portray social or mainstream media platforms as guilty parties but tends to ignore the equally detrimental ramifications of their exploitation of social capital.

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5–7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy—and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103049149"

Across two survey experiments, we find that initial exposure to a less plausible statement decreases belief in subsequent statements, whether true or false.

Using an exploratory qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. This study provides insights into the culturally situated, complicated information behaviour of repatriated migrants in Bangladesh. The findings of this study show that repatriated migrants did not seek any information in the context of their irregular migration. It is evident that factors such as unrealistic perceptions and expectations about life abroad, desperate desire to relocate to another country, and trust in smugglers and their agents played a key role in their information seeking in the context of their irregular migration. The study revealed that some participants were unaware of the risk of taking an irregular journey and deceived by the misinformation shared by their smugglers and their agents. Some interviewees even claimed not to attempt to move to Malaysia if they were aware of the heavy risks associated with the move. The concepts of ""migration as gambling""and ""Aladdin's lamp""emerged in this study have some implications for local informational program development aiming to educate vulnerable rural population about the risk of irregular migration and connect them with reliable migrational information sources. The study identified some information grounds such as the Bazaar and Betel fields, which might be useful in offering informational programs at those grounds. The findings related to the information behaviour of repatriated migrants have potential implications for research in various disciplines, including library and information science, migrational studies, geography, and psychology. © 2021 Nafiz Zaman Shuva, published by De Gruyter.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120303469"

The measure was developed and validated within a US university/college student sample. Despite its intended use, the measure is regularly used outside of the US and outside of the university/college setting without tests of validity. There is also intense debate as to the dimensionality of the measure, with one camp defending the bi-dimensionality of the measure and another proposing uni-dimensionality. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the utility of the measure outside of its intended population. Design/methodology/approach: A total of seven samples were collected (n = 1860) from the UK, Germany, France, Turkey, the Philippines, Nicaragua and the US. In this study, Infante and Rancer’s (1982) original 20-item argumentativeness measure was used to assess argumentativeness. Confirmatory factor analyses was used to test content validity. Findings: Fit statistics were consistently poor for the unidimensional factor structure. As there is debate as to whether the measure is uni or bi-dimensional, a bi-dimensional fit was also analysed. The measure performed slightly better in each sample using a bi-dimensional factor structure. However, fit statistics were still poor for each sample. Research limitations/implications: Specifically, the seven samples are convenience samples. While such a sampling technique does limit the generalizability of a study’s findings, convenience samples are common when using the argumentativeness measure. These results present avenues for exploring the dimensionality of the argumentativeness measure and for revisiting cross-cultural examinations of argumentativeness. Practical implications: Factor structure is a critical issue in validity. Whether authors specify their prediction or not, factor structure is always hypothesized as part of a study when measurements are used, and therefore, should be examined in every study as part of the scientific process. Making claims about human behaviour based upon measures with mis-specified factor structures or other validity issues can lead to the perpetuation of misinformation within the literature. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to empirically explore the psychometric properties of one of the most used measures in argument/conflict research. In doing so, this study enhances the understanding of decades of argumentativeness research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086090163"

A self-developed questionnaire was used to collect data (via an online survey) from 92 librarians in Ogun state, Nigeria. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 22. Findings revealed that librarians were knowledgeable about credible sources of COVID-19 information on social media (mean = 3.24). To a very high extent, they considered and checked the source of COVID-19 information properly before sharing on social media (mean = 3.42) and also checked for the accuracy of COVID-19 information before further sharing (mean = 3.47). The study further suggests that adequate knowledge about the credible sources of COVID-19 information among librarians might have influenced their censorship and evaluation of COVID-19 information. The study, therefore, argued that though social media are important platforms for the dynamic and quick spread of COVID-19 information, caution should be taken, to evidence the source’s credibility before use and further sharing. © 2021 The Author(s).

Strong U.S. relations with these three states are rooted in history. The United States never recognized the Soviet Union’s forcible incorporation of the Baltic states in 1940, and it applauded the restoration of their independence in 1991. These policies were backed by Congress on a bipartisan basis. The United States supported the Baltic states’ accession to NATO and the European Union (EU) in 2004. Especially since Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, potential threats posed to the Baltic states by Russia have been a primary driver of increased U.S. and congressional interest in the region. Congressional interest in the Baltic states has focused largely on defense cooperation and security assistance for the purposes of deterring potential Russian aggression and countering hybrid threats, such as disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks. Energy security is another main area of U.S. and congressional interest in the Baltic region. Regional Security Concerns: U.S., NATO, and Baltic leaders have viewed Russian military activity in the region with concern; such activity includes large-scale exercises, incursions into Baltic states’ airspace, and a layered build-up of anti-access/area denial (A2AD) capabilities. Experts have concluded that defense of the Baltic states in a conventional military conflict with Russia likely would be difficult and problematic. The Baltic states fulfill NATO’s target of spending 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, although as countries with relatively small populations, their armed forces remain relatively small and their military capabilities limited. Consequently, the Baltic states’ defense planning relies heavily on their NATO membership. Defense Cooperation and Security Assistance: The United States and the Baltic states cooperate closely on defense and security issues. New bilateral defense agreements signed in spring 2019 focus security cooperation on improving capabilities in areas such as maritime domain awareness, intelligence sharing, surveillance, and cybersecurity. The United States provides significant security assistance to the Baltic states; the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (P.L. 116-92) increased and extended U.S. assistance for building interoperability and capacity to deter and resist aggression. Under the U.S. European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), launched in 2014, the United States has bolstered its military presence in Central and Eastern Europe. As part of the associated Operation Atlantic Resolve, rotational U.S. forces have conducted various training activities and exercises in the Baltic states. NATO has also helped to bolster the Baltic states’ security. At the 2016 NATO summit, the allies agreed to deploy multinational battalions to each of the Baltic states and Poland. The United Kingdom leads the battalion deployed in Estonia, Canada leads in Latvia, and Germany leads in Lithuania. Rotational deployments of aircraft from NATO member countries have patrolled the Baltic states’ airspace since 2004; deployments have increased in size since 2014. Potential Hybrid Threats: Since 2014, when the EU adopted sanctions targeting Russia due to the Ukraine conflict, tensions between Russia and the Baltic states have grown. These conditions have generated heightened concerns about possible hybrid threats and Russian tactics, such as disinformation campaigns and propaganda, to pressure the Baltic states and promote anti-U.S. or anti-NATO narratives. A large minority of the Estonian and Latvian populations consists of ethnic Russians; Russia frequently accuses Baltic state governments of violating the rights of Russian speakers. Many ethnic Russians in the Baltic states receive their news and information from Russian media sources, potentially making those communities a leading target for disinformation and propaganda. Some observers have expressed concerns that Russia could use the Baltic states’ ethnic Russian minorities as a pretext to manufacture a crisis. Cyberattacks are another potential hybrid threat; addressing potential vulnerabilities with regard to cybersecurity is a top priority of the Baltic states. Energy Security: The Baltic states have taken steps to decrease energy reliance on Russia, including through a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Lithuania and projects to build pipeline and electricity interconnections with Poland, Finland, and Sweden. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130903685"

This study examined, through a content analysis, the performance of two fact-checking agencies during the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong from 2019 to 2020. The findings show that the fact-checkers exhibited relative partisan biases through selective agenda-setting, the selective offering of explicit criticisms, and engagement in criticisms extending beyond the basic role of claim validation. However, the two fact-checkers also arguably differed in the degree of professionalism in their practice. That is, having a partisan stance does not necessarily obliterate the concerns of professionalism and credibility.

Education, analytical skills, and exposure to high quality media information appear to equip students with the necessary tools to critically assess COVID-19-related conspiracies.

Social media consumers, also called the digital natives, tend to spend most of their time on social media and multimedia platforms. They are inclined to substitute traditional media with social media and other online services. This study argues that despite these significant transformations and the growing standing of online media, online users still perceive traditional media to be more credible sources of information than user-generated content on social media. Social media enables a breadth of ‘fake news’, which brings the overall perception of media into a different perspective. The phenomenon of misinformation and mistrust could be a new indicator of a crisis in the media that led to the post-truth era. Due to the profound negative impact of fake news on individuals and society, various detection solutions have been proposed. The users recognize the importance of regulation, particularly concerning public responsibility and the transparency of social media, as well as privacy issues.

I show how subsequent research and media coverage seized on this finding, distorting its generality and exaggerating its role relative to other factors in explaining the durability of political misperceptions. To the contrary, an emerging research consensus finds that corrective information is typically at least somewhat effective at increasing belief accuracy when received by respondents. However, the research that I review suggests that the accuracy-increasing effects of corrective information like fact checks often do not last or accumulate; instead, they frequently seem to decay or be overwhelmed by cues from elites and the media promoting more congenial but less accurate claims. As a result, misperceptions typically persist in public opinion for years after they have been debunked. Given these realities, the primary challenge for scientific communication is not to prevent backfire effects but instead, to understand how to target corrective information better and to make it more effective. Ultimately, however, the best approach is to disrupt the formation of linkages between group identities and false claims and to reduce the flow of cues reinforcing those claims from elites and the media. Doing so will require a shift from a strategy focused on providing information to the public to one that considers the roles of intermediaries in forming and maintaining belief systems. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

We point out that this story pulsates with the constituent elements of contemporaneity: certainties crumbling away, doubt rendered absolute, absence of reliable references that might structure us, the game of appearances to which reality has been reduced, the individual’s glacial loneliness. What is surprising is that Kafka anticipates by one century, and in an astonishing way, what has now become socially and politically de rigueur in 2020 Brazil: the age of post-truth, of fake news, of the staggering demoralization of politics, of lying as a strategy.

With the spread of the Internet and the Web 2.0, websites are responsible for publishing information. While most attention is on the advanced technology and graphics to attract users, many studies have indicated that users are not satisfied with the content of many websites. Hence, this paper introduces Technological Pedagogical Content Design (TPCD) model for explaining the concept of integration of pedagogy into content and technology. Further, practical instruction of using the TPCD model for designing digital services, especially websites is suggested. TPCD has fundamentally employed the concept of the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), which is a well-known framework in the field of teacher education to increase the teachers' knowledge for integrating technology into teaching and learning. However, TPCD transforms TPC Knowledge into TPC Design as practice by integrating pedagogy into technology design in a broader context. TPCD uses human science findings to design a user-centered website with a pedagogical perspective for creating, selecting, and organizing content. Given the speed and variety of technology capabilities and the increasing content volume, TPCD helps designers identify target objectives, based on true users' demands, and select appropriate content and suitable technological tools to increase desirability, usability, accessibility, and findability of information. Further, technical research on TPCD may open perspectives for developing a learning content management system for educational and other digital services. © 2021 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

Tactical use of misinformation can alter choice in humans. Whether misinformation affects decision-making in other free-living species, including problem species, is unknown. Here, we show that sensory misinformation tactics can reduce the impacts of predators on vulnerable bird populations as effectively as lethal control. We repeatedly exposed invasive mammalian predators to unprofitable bird odors for 5 weeks before native shorebirds arrived for nesting and for 8 weeks thereafter. Chick production increased 1.7-fold at odor-treated sites over 25 to 35 days, with doubled or tripled odds of successful hatching, resulting in a 127% increase in modeled population size in 25 years. We demonstrate that decision-making processes that respond to changes in information reliability are vulnerable to tactical manipulation by misinformation. Altering perceptions of prey availability offers an innovative, nonlethal approach to managing problem predators and improving conservation outcomes for threatened species.

From a questionnaire applied to 242 respondents after the first state of emergency of the covid-19 pandemic (March 2020) in Portugal, this study aims to identify the background and pre-requisites for the belief in misinformation. The data obtained suggest that individuals with populist feelings have less trust in institutional strategies to fight the pandemic, privileging social media as a source of information and revealing a greater acceptance of the conspiracy theories on the disease. The connection, documented in the literature, between the belief in conspiracy theories and risk behaviours recommends that measures be adopted to combat misinformation factors. © 2021.

The epistemic consequences at stake here are epistemic values - things or states that are valuable from an epistemic perspective, a perspective having to do with knowledge, truth, understanding, and the like. John Stuart Mill’s defense of free speech in On Liberty is a paradigm example of an epistemic argument and his argument is still widely accepted and defended today. He argues that intolerance prevents us from discovering our errors, decreases understanding, and discourages intellectual curiosity, courage, and boldness. More recently, Jonathan Rauch defends an epistemic argument according to which tolerance is a necessary ingredient of liberal science, which is our most successful method for finding truth. However, detractors have argued that often tolerance itself either does not produce epistemic value or has negative epistemic consequences. People sometimes irrationally inflate the evidence, producers and consumers of informa tion often have other than epistemic goals that can encourage the spread of false beliefs, and the structure of networks of testifiers can be exploited to spread false beliefs. Some measure of intolerance - such as what Goldman calls content-related restrictions - might have positive epistemic consequences for society. The extent and effectiveness of such restrictions, as well as how they would relate to the full range of epistemic values both individual and collective, remains an underexplored topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158958310"

One of the more damaging citation issues involves incorrectly citing article content (called quotation errors); therefore, investigating quotation accuracy is an important research endeavor. One field where quotation accuracy is needed is in the learning sciences given its impact on pedagogy. An integral article in pedagogical discussions surrounding how to teach at the college level is the meta-analysis on active learning by Freeman et al. The Freeman et al. meta-analysis compared active learning to traditional lecture in terms of its effects on student learning and has been important in national initiatives on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) reform. Given its influence coupled with the impact quotation errors could have in scientific discourse, we used citation context analysis to analyze whether assertions in the citing text that related to the efficacy of lecture and active learning were supported by what was explicitly stated in the cited meta-analysis. Assertions were analyzed undersupported, unsupported, or irrelevant for purposes of study categories. The most prevalent supported category related to active learning being more effective than lecture; the most prevalent unsupported category related to the effectiveness of specific activities/approaches other than the general approach of active learning. Overall, the percentage of supported assertions was 47.67%, and the percentage of unsupported assertions was 26.01%. Furthermore, the percentage of articles containing at least one unsupported assertion was 34.77%.

Partially due to the lack of transparency of the Chinese Government, early announcements were delayed and proven wrong undermining its credibility at the very start. Nation-states were forced to manage the pandemic based on their own experiences and conditions. The lack of clear information was compounded by the WHO being behind nations and airline companies on putting in place travel restrictions and there has been consistently contradictory advice on the efficacy of wearing face coverings. While the WHO were not at the forefront of the infodemic, the institution did little to combat misinformation and indeed provided some spaces where false notions could flourish nurtured by some WHO statements.

The present research explores a related possibility concerning the process by which people label a claim as fundamentally factual (open to proof or disproof) or opinion (a matter of personal preference not amenable to falsification). Rather than merely being more skeptical of uncongenial claims, uncongenial claims may be metacognitively categorized as more opinion than factual, while congenial claims may be more likely to be categorized as factual. The two studies reported here attempt to trace a preliminary outline of how claims are categorized as fact, opinion, or some mix of the two in the context of mundane claims, contentious political issues, and conspiracy theories. The findings suggest that claims are more likely to be labeled factual (and, to a lesser extent, are less likely to be labeled opinion) to the extent that one subjectively agrees with the content of the claim. Conspiracy theories appear to occupy a middle-ground between fact and opinion. This metacognitive approach may help shed light on popular debate about conspiracy theories, as well as seemingly intractable political disagreements more generally, which may reflect fundamental differences in the perceived epistemic foundations of claims rather than simple disagreement over the facts of the matter. Given limitations of the stimuli and participant samples, however, it remains to be seen how generalizable these findings are. © Copyright © 2021 Brotherton and Son.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103791588"

We conclude that health misinformation originates from many sources, most notably mass and social media; is fairly prevalent, both in interpersonal and mediated settings; and tends to feature negative sentiments, anecdotal evidence, and anti-science narratives. Although there is no conclusive evidence that health misinformation spreads more broadly than scientific information, health misinformation reliably leads to misperceptions on health issues.

The aim of this article is an attempt to systematize the concept of fake news and indicate the entities responsible for broadcasting this type of content in the context of applicable law. For this reason, the following hypothesis was adopted: The indifference of approaches in defining the concept of fake news means that the authors and entities distributing content are not aware of the contradiction of the actions taken with generally applicable law.

It is based on the Researching Students Information Choices (RSIC) project, which looks at how students evaluate scientific information on the internet.1 Part of this study looked at container collapse. In previous decades, information was contained in a physical book, newspaper, journal, magazine, or the like. These containers offered important contextual information about the origin and validity of the information. With information digitized, this context is lost. This can facilitate misinformation, as people might make incorrect judgments about information credibility because of the lack of context. It is vital that citizens have the information literacy skills to initially evaluate information correctly. One possibility for misinformation being pervasive is that, once encoded, it becomes resistant to correction. This underscores the importance of teaching students to evaluate the credibility of information prior to the point of encoding. To combat misinformation, librarians can teach students to evaluate containers and the indicators of credibility that they provide. Information containers can be evaluated prior to consuming information within a resource, while fact-checking only can happen after.

Strong pillars of belief among the QAnon movement, coupled with the spread of disinformation online, has exacerbated the familiarity and willingness to accept the rhetoric within mainstream media and culture. This report examines the evolution, ideologies, and paradigms associated with supporters of QAnon to better understand the most influential mechanisms of modern conspiracy-based radicalization. Utilizing a France-based digital disinformation platform known as Storyzy, the authors hypothesize that disinformation campaigns, coupled with the Internet and social media, has greatly enabled the unprecedented global effect of QAnon. The authors explored the potential of several survey methods to seek insights from QAnon followers on Gab and Telegram.

Popular strategies for mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging binary classifications reduced social learning and maintained polarization. The benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants’ education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship. © 2021 Guilbeault et al.

For many decades, there has been doubt, ambiguity, uncertainty and no accuracy or transparency concerning the real physical/chemical characteristics of crude oil produced in the DRC. Therefore, this paper explores and analyses the characteristics of crude oils produced in other world regions to understand and classify the value of the DRC’s produced crude oil, by means of reference to the international standard that define the Gravity (°API) and Sulphur (Wt. %) of crude oil, whether it is light or heavy crude oil. It attempts to bring more evidence of crude oils characteristics that relate to crude oil produced in the DRC since 1973. The objective consists of categorising crude oil produced in the Kongo Central province of the DRC, to determine whether it has been Light Sweet, Light Sour, Medium-Medium Sour, Medium Sour, Heavy Sweet or Heavy Sour. This clarification is very critical in imperative to dissipate the cloud of misinformation and misperception of the property range of crude oil that has been produced consecutively by several multinational oil companies in the DRC since many decades. The PESTIE model or framework was applied to understand the mysterious and ambiguous barriers affecting the entire petroleum industry development in the DRC. A mixed methods approach was useful to gather different views, opinions and perceptions from qualified stakeholders involved in the DRC’s petroleum industry. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were proficient in revealing often multifaceted of the real value of the DRC’s crude oil. The results of this study revealed that the situation of misperception and confusion overshadowing crude oil specifications in the DRC are caused by a complex situation of the business environment uncertainties and instabilities, as well as the vulnerability of the political and socio-economic environments instituted by the colonial economic model (heritage and culture of exploitation and production of natural mineral resources) imposed by a complex system of the global business environment. Results also claimed that much confusion or uncertainties are from opinions, which are lacking accurate information regarding the correct statistical properties of crude oil produced in the country, as well as from the political interferences, frauds, and corruptions, which have been fuelling or influencing opinions about the mass or natural property range of the DRC’s produced crude oil. One of the approaches suggested in solving various challenges affecting the DRC’s petroleum industry consist of applying the best-practice of the rule of law; the review, monitoring and re-evaluation of policies, regulations, programmes, and strategic plans; transparency system and ensuring the business environment stability in the country. Managing accurately oil and gas activities in the country could be the outcome of less political interference in several socio-economic activities. Thus, it was advised that policymakers and decision-makers have to promote and support the development of research institution in line with the natural mineral resources production and processing industry in the country © 2021,Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The propagation of this influence through conversational social networks should impact the degree to which community members synchronize their beliefs. To investigate, we recruited a sample of 140 participants and constructed fourteen 10-member communities. Participants first rated the accuracy of a set of statements (pre-test) and were then provided with relevant evidence about them. Then, participants discussed the statements in a series of conversational interactions, following pre-determined network structures (clustered/non-clustered). Finally, they rated the accuracy of the statements again (post-test). The results show that belief synchronization, measuring the increase in belief similarity among individuals within a community from pre-test to post-test, is influenced by the community's conversational network structure. This synchronization is circumscribed by a degree of separation effect and is equivalent in the clustered and non-clustered networks. We also find that conversational content predicts belief change from pre-test to post-test. © 2021 Brill Academic Publishers.

Some individuals have done so successfully while others have outrightly resisted. This chapter reviews three primary constructs for which a burgeoning literature base has emerged, and which appear to be associated with compliance with health-protective behaviors in the context of COVID-19. First, the tendency to believe and propagate COVID-19 misinformation, primarily over social media. Two principal factors have been implicated in explaining some individuals’ tendency to share misinformation-evidence relating to deficient self-regulation and information overload is reviewed with the net result being decreased compliance. Second, perceived risk, the extent to which individuals view themselves to be vulnerable to infection coupled with beliefs relating to their perceived self-efficacy to successfully implement the recommended behaviors appears particularly important. Third, personality traits also appear to exert a degree of predictive control over compliance, albeit smaller in comparison to the preceding factors. Most notably individuals who are agreeable tend to comply while those with Dark Triad traits (Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism) are more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors (e.g., stockpiling). These results can be used to inform the design and dissemination of public health information during the pandemic; specifically, campaigns should include information that is clear, consistent, and understandable and emphasizes the effectiveness of the recommended behaviors so as to reduce uncertainty and increase public self-efficacy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Instead, I suggest that, on one hand, deliberative democracy and Jürgen Habermas’ idea of democracy as truth-tracking offer a more helpful framework for assessing and combating the threat of fake news and, on the other hand, Bernard Williams’ virtues of accuracy identify the citizen virtues necessary to counteract fake news. The virtues of accuracy, I contend, can be facilitated and encouraged through structural and regulatory features in the public sphere.

As polarization undermines the ability of science to inform policy, clarifying why partisans report different science knowledge is vital. This study uses novel measurement to differentiate among knowledge, misinformation, guessing, and rejection while identifying covariates of these cognitions. First, we find that Republicans' incorrect beliefs about climate change stem from a mix of guessing, misperceptions, and rejection. Second, multiple cognitions appear closely linked to partisanship, suggesting politically motivated reasoning as likely driving knowledge differences.

Treating an account's social media following as both an ego network and an audience critical for information diffusion and influence accrual, we situate IRA Twitter accounts' accumulation of followers in the ideologically polarized, attention driven, and asymmetric political communication system. Results show that partisan enclaves on Twitter contributed to IRA accounts' followings through retweeting; and that mainstream and hyperpartisan media assisted conservative IRA accounts' following gain by embedding their tweets in news. These results illustrate how network dynamics within social media and news media amplification beyond it together boosted social media followings.

Methods – Using the Moodle Learning Management System, incoming first-year students completed a mandatory questionnaire that included multiple choice, Likert scale, open-ended, and true/false questions related to news consumption. Two questions asked students to identify which news sources and social networking sites they have used recently, and the next two questions asked students to define fake news and rate the degree to which fake news impacts them personally and the degree to which it impacts society. The end of the survey presented students with screenshots of three news stories and asked them to reflect on how they would evaluate the claim in the story, their confidence level in the claim, and whether or not they would share this news item on social media. The three items chosen represent certain situations that commonly cause confusion for news consumers: (a) a heading that does not match the text of the article, (b) a syndicated news story, and (c) an impostor URL and fake news story. Researchers coded the student responses using both preset and emergent codes. Main Results – Eighty-two percent of students reported using at least one social media site to access political news in the previous seven days. Students reported believing that fake news is a worrying trend for society, with 86% labelling it either a “moderate” or “extreme” barrier to society’s ability to recognize accurate information. However, they expressed less concern about their own ability to navigate an information environment in which fake news is prevalent, with 51% agreeing that it has only somewhat of an effect on their own ability to effectively navigate digital information. Of the three news items presented to them, students expressed the least confidence (an average of 1.55/4) and least interest in sharing (12%) the first news item, in which the heading does not match the text. However, only 14% of respondents noted this mismatch. In evaluations of the second item, an AP news item on the Breitbart website, 35% of students noted the website on which the article was found, but fewer noted that the original source is the Associated Press. Student responses to the third article, a fake news item from a website masquerading as an NBC website, show that 37% of students believed the source to come from a legitimate NBC source. Only 7% of students recognized the unusual URL, and 24% of respondents indicated that they might share this news item on social media. Conclusion – The study finds that impostor URLs and syndicated news items might confuse students into misevaluating the information before them, and that librarians and other instructors should raise awareness of these tactics. ©2021 Schroeder","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103725818"

Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094641773"

One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.

Realism is addressed as a representational choice as well as a political goal and is defined as the believable articulation of reality. By placing issues of credibility and the viewer’s role as arbiter of the work’s truth value in relation to contemporary notions of ‘truthiness’ (that are based on the viewer’s belief system rather than on fact) the article analyzes animated documentaries in the wider atmosphere of post-truth. I focus on two conflicting theorizations of realism: realism as the familiar and easily read vs. realism as de-familiarization. Whereas only a decade ago animated documentaries were deemed oxymoronic by many, as the sub-genre of animated documentaries proliferates it risks losing its critical potential and becoming an easy way to promote misinformation for viewers who cease to question the representation that becomes ‘invisible’ due to common use. That said, animated documentaries that creatively combine varied visual styles and intentionally disrupt viewing have the potential to de-familiarize by accentuating the representational choices made, which is crucial for engaging, critically evaluating information and creating counter narratives in a post-truth era. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073920004"

Despite an estimated 18 million Google searches on abortion per year and the demonstrated importance of the abortion pill as an option for pregnancy termination, the top webpage search results for abortion pill searches, as well as the content and quality of those webpages, are not well understood. Methods We used Google’s Custom Search Application Programming Interface (API) to identify the top 10 webpages presented for “abortion pill” searches on August 06, 2018. We developed a comprehensive, evidence-based Family Planning Webpage Quality Assessment Tool (FPWQAT), which was used to assess webpage quality for the five top webpages presenting text-based educational content. Results Of the top webpages for “abortion pill” searches, a plannedparenthood.com page was the top result and scored highest on our assessment (81%), providing high-quality and useable information. The other four webpages, a Wikipedia.com page and three anti-abortion information webpages, scored much lower on our assessment (14%-43%). These four webpages had lower quality of information in less useable formats. The anti-abortion pages also presented a variety of disinformation about the abortion pill. Conclusions Both the lack of accurate clinical content on the majority of top webpages and the concerning disinformation they contained raise concerns about the quality of online abortion pill information, while underlining challenges posed by Google search results to informed choice for consumers. Healthcare providers and consumers must be informed of online abortion pill content that is not based in current clinical evidence, while advocates and policymakers should push for online information that is credible and useable. These changes are imperative given the importance of sound abortion pill information for reproductive decision-making at a time when in-person abortion services are further challenged in the US.

Many studies that use suggestion to instigate false memories follow a procedure called the misinformation paradigm in which participants are exposed to erroneous information. False memory implantation studies have also been undertaken using child participants. In Associative Activation Theory is assumed that false memories are caused by associative activation spreading throughout an individual’s knowledge base. False memory models have emphasized that, in order to fuel false memory formation of fictitious events, people should first believe that the event is something plausible that could have happened to them. Experimentation in adults has found that, although script knowledge affects the formation of false beliefs, it is not a prerequisite for false beliefs to occur. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Jan Rummel.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109608610"

Topical relevance contributed to a user’s belief in false news (BFN) in the SM group but had no impact in the NW group. Image appeal had no impact in either group.

Due to Republican leadership’s initial downplaying of COVID-19 and the resulting partisan media coverage, we predicted that conservatives would perceive it as less threatening. Two preregistered online studies supported this prediction. Conservatism was associated with perceiving less personal vulnerability to the virus and the virus’s severity as lower, and stronger endorsement of the beliefs that the media had exaggerated the virus’s impact and that the spread of the virus was a conspiracy. Conservatism also predicted less accurate discernment between real and fake COVID-19 headlines and fewer accurate responses to COVID-19 knowledge questions. Path analyses suggested that presidential approval, knowledge about COVID-19, and news discernment mediated the relationship between ideology and perceived vulnerability.

Although previous research identified several reliable predictors of truth judgments—such as source credibility, repeated information exposure, and presentation format—little is known about their simultaneous effects. In a series of four experiments, we investigated how the abovementioned factors jointly affect the perceived truth of statements (Experiments 1 and 2) and simulated social media postings (Experiments 3 and 4). Experiment 1 explored the role of source credibility (high vs. low vs. no source information) and presentation format (with vs. without a picture). In Experiments 2 and 3, we additionally manipulated repeated exposure (yes vs. no). Finally, Experiment 4 examined the role of source credibility (high vs. low) and type of repetition (congruent vs. incongruent vs. no repetition) in further detail. In sum, we found no effect of presentation format on truth judgments, but strong, additive effects of source credibility and repetition. Truth judgments were higher for information presented by credible sources than non-credible sources and information without sources. Moreover, congruent (i.e., verbatim) repetition increased perceived truth whereas semantically incongruent repetition decreased perceived truth, irrespectively of the source. Our findings show that people do not rely on a single judgment cue when evaluating a statement’s truth but take source credibility and their meta-cognitive feelings into account. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095827450"

So how are educators to build awareness of visual literacy when manipulation has become ubiquitous? I argue that understanding the credibility of visual content must go beyond viewing the image as identifying whether a photo has or has not been manipulated. Instead, it requires a technical comprehension of the process by which images are created, allowing educators to discern between visual lies and everyday image editing. To this end, I position Photoshop as a teaching tool, one that offers educators and students a backstage view at the mechanisms of image alteration technology. In building a technical and rhetorical understanding of three key Photoshop tools—airbrush, layers, and filters—I outline a guide for using these tools grounded in critical considerations of how their use affects visual meaning. From this understanding, educators can move beyond blanket criticism of visual manipulation and into the ethical nuances of photo editing that distinguish meme from misinformation. © 2021 International Visual Literacy Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103359995"

This study examined the relationship between perceived credibility of information sources and adoption of COVID-19 preventive strategies among residents in South West Nigeria. The study adopted Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), while online survey and in-depth interview (IDI) were employed as the research designs. Convenience and purposive sampling procedures were used in the selection of 259 respondents and ten participants who were 18 years and above. Data were generated using questionnaire and interview guide. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and multiple bootstrapping comparison test were used to analyse quantitative data, while qualitative data were transcribed and direct quotations that represented the participants’ opinions were used for the analysis. Key findings showed that expertise and trustworthiness determined the credibility of information sources while television was perceived as the most credible source of information. A significant relationship exists between perceived credibility of information sources and adoption of preventive measures. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies to be disseminated through credible information sources. © 2021 Intellect Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107573001"

Previous studies have demonstrated the illusory truth effect with true and false news headlines. The present study examined the effects that different ratings made during initial exposure have on the illusory truth effect with news headlines. In two experiments, participants (total N = 575) rated a set of news headlines in one of two conditions. Some participants rated how interesting they were, and others rated how truthful they were. Participants later rated the perceived accuracy of a larger set of headlines that included previously rated and new headlines. In both experiments, prior exposure increased perceived accuracy for participants who made initial interest ratings, but not for participants who made initial truthfulness ratings. The increase in perceived accuracy that accompanies repeated exposure was attenuated when participants considered the accuracy of the headlines at initial exposure. Experiment 2 also found evidence for a political bias: participants rated politically concordant headlines as more accurate than politically discordant headlines. The magnitude of this bias was related to performance on a cognitive reflection test; more analytic participants demonstrated greater political bias. These results highlight challenges that fake news presents and suggest that initially encoding headlines’ perceived truth can serve to combat the illusion that a familiar headline is a truthful one. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095110491"

Abī Tālib (d. 40/661), who took over the caliphate duty in a troubled environment after the murder of 'Uthmān b. 'Affān (d. 35/656), first faced with the demands that the murderers of his murdered predecessor be punished. Although Hazrat 'Ali himself was of the same opinion, he wanted to ensure public order in the city first. However, the Companions of the Prophet (aṣ-ṣaḥābah) like Zubayr b. al-'Awwām (d. 36/656) and Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh (d. 36/656), who were not convinced about this issue, started an opposition movement under the leadership of 'Ā'isha bt. Abī Bakr (d. 58/678), who went to Mecca. The attempts of this movement, which got out of control with the participation of Umayyads and 'Abdallāh b. Saba' supporters of different intentions, ended with The Battle of the Camel. Before the war took place, Hazrat 'Ā'isha heard the barking of dogs when the army led by 'Ā'isha came to Hawaab on the road to Basra. For this reason, she asked where they were. When she heard that this region was Hawaab, she wanted to go back. Because the Hazrat Prophet had said the following before: ""Which of you the Haw's dogs will bark for."" The following statement is used in the hadīth sources in several different variants, generally without specifying a name: ""Thereupon, the people with her wanted her to continue her journey, hoping that the Muslims would recover.” At this point, there is a difference between hadīth sources and Islamic historical sources. Islamic historical sources state that the people who wanted her to continue her journey were Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh, Zubayr b. al-'Awwām and 'Abdallāh b. al-Zubayr (d. 73/692). The following statements are included in another narration reported from Ibn 'Abbās (d. 68/688) regarding the issue: The Prophet said to his wives: “I wish I knew! Which of you owns the beautiful hairy camel!” She will set out and then Hawaab dogs will bark at her, many people will be killed, right and left. Then she will survive when she is almost dead. A fifth piece of news mentioned within this framework was narrated by Abū Rāfi' (d. 40/660). According to this rumor, the Prophet of Allah said to Hazrat 'Ali: ""Something will happen between you and 'Ā'isha."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""O Prophet of God! Me?"" Allah's Prophet said: ""Yes."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""Is it me among my friends?"" Allah's Prophet said: ""Yes."" Hazrat 'Alī said: ""Well, did I trouble them?"" The Prophet of Allah said: ""No,"" and then added: ""If such a thing happens, take her to a safe place."" The sixth narration on the subject is a statement made by Hudhayfa b. al-Yamân (d. 36/656). Accordingly, Hudhayfa said: ""Would you believe me if I told you that one of your mothers will set out with a group of Muslims and will fight you?"" Those who were there said: ""Will this really happen?"" Hudhayfa said: ""Yes"". The last narration mentioned in this context is the news of Abu Bakra (d. 52/671). According to this narration: ""Abū Bakra said: Immediately after joining the people of Camel in order to fight with them in the days of Camel, Allah helped me with a word I heard from the Prophet. When the news that the Persians appointed the daughter of Kisra as the ruler reached the Prophet, the Prophet said: ‘The people who entrust their works to women will not find peace'. "" In such a situation, it becomes important to analyze the narrations. Because analyzing the reliability of the narrators and the contents of the narrations will help to understand the subject in a healthy way. Although hadith scholars make some different statements about the reliability of the people who narrated the narrations, the view that gains weight is that they are reliable. Likewise, no problem was detected in the contents of the narrations. Some problems draw attention when Islamic historical sources are considered. For, these historians were not as sensitive as hadith scholars regarding the evaluation of the narrations. At this point, two problems draw attention: The transponder understanding adopted in the early stages of historiography. The effort to protect some valued people. Early historians generally adopted the transponder understanding while writing their works. For this reason, some misinformation that was not analyzed began to be passed down from generation to generation. At this point, the science of history should benefit from the methods of hadith and its sound narrations. In addition, the effort to protect a valuable person like Hazrat 'A'isha has brought the understanding of holding the Companions like Talha b. ‘Ubaydallāh and Zubayr b. al-'Awwām responsible for a behavior that is thought to be wrong. However, it should not be ignored that people can make mistakes. Loving Hazrat 'Ā'isha does not require defending her wrong decision. In addition, this has brought the accusation of other Companions of behavior unbecoming to them. © 2021 Published by Sivas Cumhuriyet Üniversitesi, İlahiyat Fakültesi / Sivas Cumhuriyet University, Faculty of Theology, Sivas, 58140 Turkey.

This attracted grassroots opposition and considerable debate among vaccine hesitant factions online. This mixed-methods study used quantitative linguistic analysis, semantic network analysis, and content analysis techniques to examine 2424 online documents drawn from newspapers, blogs, health websites, government information pages, web forums, personal websites, Facebook groups, among others. The study examined which words and phrases were used most frequently by vaccine skeptics, vaccine defenders, and more neutral media accounts to illuminate how groups with different attitudes towards vaccination discuss and disseminate information about vaccines and vaccine policy online. We proposed an innovative methodology for examining online discourse surrounding vaccine hesitance, as well as for studying the online dissemination of misinformation about vaccines. Our findings highlighted discrepancies in the narratives between what vaccine supporters believe causes vaccine skepticism and the issues that vaccine skeptics actually discuss within their own digital spaces. For example, in these exchanges, the importance of parental rights overshadowed that of children's rights; supporters of vaccines brought up autism in more distinct documents than skeptics do; distrust of government regulators and researchers seemed to unite vaccine skeptics and defenders; and politicians, doctors, and even celebrities often served as proxies in heated exchanges about factual evidence, believability, and the importance of expertise in public discourse. © 2020 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094216535"

One understudied factor that likely influences the success of fact-checking initiatives is the presence of opinion statements in fact-checked messages. Recent work suggests that people may have difficulty differentiating opinion- from fact-based claims, especially when they are congruent with preexisting beliefs. In three experiments, we investigated the consequences of opinion-based claims to the efficacy of fact-checking in correcting misinformation regarding gun policy. Study 1 (N = 152) demonstrated that fact-checking is less effective when it attempts to correct statements that include both fact- and opinion-based claims. Study 2 (N = 561) replicated and expanded these findings showing that correction is contingent on people’s ability to accurately distinguish facts from opinions. Study 3 (N = 389) illustrated that the observed effects are governed by motivated reasoning rather than actual inability to ascertain fact-based claims. Together these results suggest that distinguishing facts from opinions is a major hurdle to effective fact-checking. © 2021 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100554774"

Quantitative data from the Digital News Report (2018 and 2019), based on a survey of more than 2000 digital users from each country was used for the analysis. Results show remarkable similarities among the three countries, and how digital users identically ranked the types of problematic information that concerned them most. Survey participants were most concerned by stories where facts are spun or twisted to push a particular agenda, followed by, those that are completely made up for political or commercial rea-sons, and finally, they were least concerned by poor journalism (factual mistakes, dumbed-down stories, misleading head-lines/clickbait). A general index of “Concern about disinformation” was constructed using several sociodemographic variables that might influence the perception. It showed that the phenomenon is higher among women, older users, those particularly interested in political news, and among left-wingers. Several measures are employed by users to avoid disinfor-mation, such as checking a number of different sources to see whether a news story is reported in the same way, relying on the reputation of the news company, and/or deciding not to share a news story due to doubts regarding its accuracy. This article concludes that the perceived relevance of different types of problematic information, and preventive actions, are not homogeneous among different population segments. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102877854"

Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk. © 2020 Guenther, Shanahan.

Fact-checking outlets around the world have been actively counteracting false and misleading information surrounding the pandemic. In this article, we conceptualize fact checkers in terms of the “interpretative power” that journalism holds in processes of political performances (Alexander in Soc Theory 22(4): 527–573, 2004, in: The performance of politics. Obama’s victory and the struggle for democratic power. Oxford University Press, Oxford/New York, 2010). Drawing on virus-related fact checks from Poynter’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) database, we make two arguments. First, we argue that the new phenomenon of specialized “fact checking” might be considered as a further explicitly differentiated element of Alexander’s model of cultural performance, which fulfills a double duty: trying to contribute to further “de-fusion” (separating audiences from actors when the latter lack authenticity and credibility) on the one hand, and working to overcome it on the other. Second, we explain how new fact-checking practices have become a reflexive supplement to the news media of the civil sphere that might be able to help the civil sphere’s communicative institutions to defend truthfulness in a manner that contributes to democracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091604097"

The dependency theory of the media system was developed in the 1970s when mass media were the dominant source of information. Today, at a time when media choices have become abundant, studies are needed to understand the phenomenon of media dependence in light of new dimensions made important by the transformations that have taken place in the social and media fields—where the coexistence of mass media with social media platforms stands out. As large-scale crises rarely occur and the media environment changes rapidly, it is important to analyze how media dependence relates to choose and trust in different media (traditional media vs. social media) in times of crisis. Several questions arise. What is the trust attributed by individuals to social media as sources of information about COVID-19? How well informed are the individuals who choose these sources as the main sources of information? From a questionnaire administered to 244 individuals in Portugal, during the first week of the state of emergency (March 2020), this research seeks to identify how people gained access to information about COVID-19, how they acted critically towards the various sources and how they assess the reliability of different media. Finally, it analyzes the association between the type of medium chosen and adherence to misinformation content about the virus. The results reveal the existence of a phenomenon of dependence on the media, with a strong exposure (both active and accidental) to informative content, with conventional media being privileged as the main source, and positively distinguished in terms of confidence. Finally, a statistically significant association of a positive sign was identified between the use of social media as the main source and the acceptance of misinformation. © 2020 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168709808"

Although trust is usually viewed as a positive element of decision making, we suggest that its effects on memory are costly rather than beneficial. Across nine studies using three different manipulations of trust and distrust and three different memory paradigms, we find that trust reduces memory performance as compared with distrust. In Study 1, trust leads to higher acceptance rates of misinformation. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrate that participants in a distrust and a control condition perform better at a memoryrecognition task than participants in a trust condition. Studies 3a and 3b show that trust also reduces free recall of memory content. Examining the underlying mechanism, we find that reduced memory performance in a state of trust is caused by an increased perception of similarities between items that are to be memorized. Following a causal chain design, Study 4 shows that trust increases the sensitivity to similarities as compared with distrust and a control condition, and Study 5 shows that a processing focus on similarities reduces memory accuracy. Studies 6 and 7 create circumstances that either leave the proposed mediator free to vary or interrupt it via the induction of a similarity-focus (Study 6) or a difference- focus (Study 7). The disadvantage of trust is only present if the mediating processing focus can freely operate. Overall, these studies show that trust impairs memory performance due to an increased perception of similarities between memory content © 2021 American Psychological Association","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107861745"

Given the importance of partisan affiliation and the degree of partisan polarization in the American society, that is certainly an important driver of public opinion, and a necessary one to understand. But an overlooked set of predispositions might also shape COVID beliefs and attitudes: populism. It is a worldview that pits average citizens against “the elites” and, importantly in the context of a pandemic, it includes anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including scientists). We find that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship. Furthermore, we find that conservative media consumption tends to be a stronger predictor of conspiracy belief among those high in populism than among those low in populism. We also show that these beliefs have consequences: those who believe the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are less likely to adapt behaviors recommended by public health officials. © The Author(s) 2021.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101001632"

Hegemonic constructions of jihad in the West are commonly reduced to false binaries that shape non-Muslims’ extant beliefs and perceptions of Islam and Muslims. This raises concerns about the ways in which societal expectations shape knowledge formation in schools. Accordingly, this critical content analysis explored the depiction of jihad in three graphic novel memoirs, an increasingly popular medium of instruction in secondary classrooms. Our analysis identified three forms of jihad conveyed through the graphic novels, specifically: jihad for education, jihad for gender justice, and jihad for identity. These representations provide robust counternarratives and suggest the value of teaching religious concepts through graphic novels as a way to develop deeper understandings and counter misinformation. The article concludes with six recommendations for educators to consider when teaching religious content through contemporary graphic novels. © 2020 by the authors.

Studies on the ‘Continued Influence Effect’ (CIE) show that misinformation continues to influence reasoning despite subsequent retraction. Current explanatory theories of the CIE tacitly assume continued reliance on misinformation is the consequence of a biased process. In the present work, we show why this perspective may be erroneous. Using a Bayesian formalism, we conceptualize the CIE as a scenario involving contradictory testimonies and incorporate the previously overlooked factors of the temporal dependence (misinformation precedes its retraction) between, and the perceived reliability of, misinforming and retracting sources. When considering such factors, we show the CIE to have normative backing. We demonstrate that, on aggregate, lay reasoners (N = 101) intuitively endorse the necessary assumptions that demarcate CIE as a rational process, still exhibit the standard effect, and appropriately penalize the reliability of contradicting sources. Individual-level analyses revealed that although many participants endorsed assumptions for a rational CIE, very few were able to execute the complex model update that the Bayesian model entails. In sum, we provide a novel illustration of the pervasive influence of misinformation as the consequence of a rational process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091778330"

We investigate perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania during the lockdown and the state of alert (April and July 2020) using survey data. Building on measures tested in previous research, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. We test whether individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations. We find an indirect relationship between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn are associated with reduced compliance with official guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences.

Two experiments uncovered a theoretical mechanism underlying the effect of fact-checking on sharing intentions, and identified an important contextual cue (i.e., social media metrics) that interacts with fact-checking effects. Exposure to fake news with fact-checking information (vs. fake news without fact-checking information) yielded more negative evaluations of the news and a greater belief that others are more influenced by the news than oneself (third-person perception [TPP]). Increased TPP, in turn, led to weaker intentions to share fake news on social media. Fact-checking information also nullified the effect of social media metrics on sharing intentions; without fact-checking information, higher (vs. lower) social media metrics induced greater intentions to share the news.

The study aims to answer the research question of: Are the influences of social media use different from normal times? The online questionnaire has been completed by six hundred and sixty-eight users within the period of lockdown. The author prepared the questionnaire, which is composed of 22 positive statements in order to evaluate the effects of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 5 point Likert scale was used, where reliability and validity were calculated by the Cronbach's alpha value, which was 0.751. Findings highlight that users have more information about COVID-19, and they follow recent information via social media, which shows the shift towards digital medium. Findings also indicate that users are aware of fake news, and they follow official sources. Social media is powerful to affect decision-makers, and respondents' social media use did not create any panic or anxiety amongst them. This research indicates that respondents' social media use during COVID-19 is different from normal times as a common purpose triggers this, survival. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most of social media shares were like a dream or a strong desire that may cause anxiety in others.

Nevertheless, the general public view of these therapies remains relatively unexplored. Our study identifies the social factors that determine a person’s trust in alternative therapies, like homeopathy or acupuncture, drawing conclusions from the results of the Spanish National Survey on the Social Perception of Science and Technology (N = 6,357). We show that trust in the effectiveness of CAM therapies is not mutually exclusive with a belief in science for the general public, pointing to a certain level of disinformation. The comparison with superstitions confirms a clear differentiation with the drivers of trust in analyzed CAM therapies. We argue that scientific appearance of these alternative therapies, in terms of prescription, communication and marketing, may play an important role in determining trust in them for a large part of the population. Furthermore, we confirm that women and those with higher socio-economic status are more likely to express trust in the effectiveness of CAM therapies. Additionally, distrust of the influence of big pharma on health policies seems to have an effect on viewing CAM therapies as more effective. Finally, we argue that media and pharmacies may have an effect on the scientific-like perception of CAM therapies, contributing to the social construction of trust in its effectiveness. Therefore, widespread confusion about the scientific validation of homeopathy may be among the main factors driving its successful extension as a practice. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083488321"

Following these directions, we explore the possibility of classifying news articles circulating on social media based exclusively on a topological analysis of their diffusion networks. To this aim we collected a large dataset of diffusion networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles published on two distinct classes of sources, namely outlets that convey mainstream, reliable and objective information and those that fabricate and disseminate various kinds of misleading articles, including false news intended to harm, satire intended to make people laugh, click-bait news that may be entirely factual or rumors that are unproven. We carried out an extensive comparison of these networks using several alignment-free approaches including basic network properties, centrality measures distributions, and network distances.

Our results highlight that the communities of users spreading mainstream news, compared to those sharing misleading news, tend to shape diffusion networks with subtle yet systematic differences which might be effectively employed to identify misleading and harmful information. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078437299"

Using survey data we collected in April 2020 on a national sample of Americans, we tested the knowledge gap hypothesis by examining how people’s education levels relate to their knowledge about COVID-19 as well as their susceptibility to fake news, and whether information sources moderate this relationship. Our findings suggest that a knowledge gap exists, with those with higher education levels displaying higher levels of knowledge. In contrast, education level did not play a role in believing false information. Moreover, higher news consumption through radio, print newspapers and magazines, and especially social media was associated with lower levels of knowledge and more fake news beliefs. However, news media consumption did not moderate the relationship between education and either knowledge or fake news beliefs, meaning that the media did not explain the education-based knowledge gap during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021.

Through a cross-sectional survey (N = 1,820) on the 2019 Indonesian national elections, we analyze the relationship among belief in misinformation, social media use, and partisanship. The analysis shows that although the political use of social media is not associated with belief in misinformation, partisanship is strongly associated with belief in various types of misinformation, depending on whether their own candidate or the opposing candidate is targeted. The findings are interpreted through the concept of selective belief. This study contributes to theoretical debates on the association among belief in misinformation, social media use, and partisanship, and addresses the role of disinformation in electoral politics in Indonesia.

Past studies in reinforcement learning and educational psychology have linked prediction error, a measure of surprise, to successful learning from feedback. However, there are substantial individual differences in belief-updating success, and the psychological factors that influence belief updating remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel factor that may predict belief updating: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is characterized by a desire for order, structure, and preservation of social norms. We hypothesized that because people who score high on RWA are motivated to preserve entrenched beliefs, they may often fail to successfully update their beliefs when confronted with new information. Using a novel paradigm, we challenged participants’ false beliefs and misconceptions to elicit prediction error. In two studies, we found consistent evidence that high-RWA individuals were less successful at correcting their false beliefs. Relative to low-RWA individuals, high-RWA individuals were less likely to revise beliefs in response to prediction error. We argue that RWA is associated with a relatively closed-minded cognitive style that negatively influences belief updating. © 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088632922"

We introduce a formal mathematical model to understand factors influencing the behavior of social media users when encountering fake news. The model illustrates that direct efforts by social media platforms and governments, along with informal pressure from social networks, can reduce the likelihood that users who encounter fake news embrace and further circulate it.

We begin this research by proposing and validating a novel measure of MFW; including a short-form scale suitable for administration in public opinion surveys. We find that nearly all Americans—irrespective of socio-economic status, political orientation, and educational background—endorse at least some aspects of MFW. Concerningly, and consistent with the idea that folk wisdom challenges scientific expertise, we additionally find that those highest in MFW tend to place less value on medical expertise and the role experts play in shaping health policy.

These intentionally false or misleading stories threaten the democratic goal of a well-informed electorate. This study evaluates the effectiveness of strategies that could be used by Facebook and other social media to counter false stories. Results from a pre-registered experiment indicate that false headlines are perceived as less accurate when people receive a general warning about misleading information on social media or when specific headlines are accompanied by a “Disputed” or “Rated false” tag. Though the magnitudes of these effects are relatively modest, they generally do not vary by whether headlines were congenial to respondents’ political views. In addition, we find that adding a “Rated false” tag to an article headline lowers its perceived accuracy more than adding a “Disputed” tag (Facebook’s original approach) relative to a control condition. Finally, though exposure to the “Disputed” or “Rated false” tags did not affect the perceived accuracy of unlabeled false or true headlines, exposure to a general warning decreased belief in the accuracy of true headlines, suggesting the need for further research into how to most effectively counter false news without distorting belief in true information. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061502088"

Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Methods An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value <0.05. Results A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include people’s perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p <0.05). Conclusions Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures. All forms of media should be properly used and regulated to disseminate credible information while filtering out myths and falsehoods. © 2020 Kebede et al.

We have seen it perpetuate the idea of a flat earth, convince communities that vaccines are more dangerous than helpful, and even suggest a connection between the “5G” communication infrastructure and COVID-19.1 Nor is disinformation a new phenomenon in the weapons inspection arena. Weapons inspectors themselves are often forced to sift through alternative narratives of events and inconsistent reporting, and they regularly see their credibility and conclusions questioned in the face of government politics or public biases. But certain recent disinformation campaigns have become so overwhelmingly comprehensive and effective that they constitute a new kind of threat. By preventing accountability for clear violations of international law, these campaigns have created a challenge to the survival of arms control treaties themselves. If weapons inspectors cannot regain the trust of the international community in the face of this challenge, it will be increasingly difficult to ensure compliance with arms control and disarmament treaties going forward. In this essay, I will briefly discuss one of the most comprehensive disinformation efforts of the past decade: the disinformation campaign used to prevent accountability for Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons. After this discussion, I will propose one possible approach to help protect the credibility of disarmament experts and weapons inspectors in the face of pervasive disinformation. This approach will require a concerted effort to connect and support compliance experts and to understand and explain their expertise across cultural, political, national, economic, and religious divides. © Mallory Stewart 2021.

Rumor initiators seek social networks vulnerable to illimitable spread, therefore, online social media becomes their stage. Hence, this misinformation imposes colossal damage to individuals, organizations, and the government, etc. Existing work, analyzing temporal and linguistic characteristics of rumors seems to give ample time for rumor propagation. Meanwhile, with the huge outburst of data on social media, studying these characteristics for each tweet becomes spatially complex. Therefore, in this article, a two-fold supervised machine-learning framework is proposed that detects rumors by filtering and then analyzing their linguistic properties. This method attempts to automate filtering by training multiple classification algorithms with accuracy higher than 81.079%. Finally, using textual characteristics on the filtered data, rumors are detected. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is shown through extensive experiments on over 10,000 tweets. © 2021, IGI Global.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137654019"

Using 3 longitudinal experiments (2 preregistered), we tested the effectiveness of Bad News, a real-world intervention in which participants develop resistance against misinformation through exposure to weakened doses of misinformation techniques. In 3 experiments (NExp1 = 151, NExp2 = 194, NExp3 = 170), participants played either Bad News (inoculation group) or Tetris (gamified control group) and rated the reliability of news headlines that either used a misinformation technique or not. We found that participants rate fake news as significantly less reliable after the intervention. In Experiment 1, we assessed participants at regular intervals to explore the longevity of this effect and found that the inoculation effect remains stable for at least 3 months. In Experiment 2, we sought to replicate these findings without regular testing and found significant decay over a 2-month time period so that the long-term inoculation effect was no longer significant. In Experiment 3, we replicated the inoculation effect and investigated whether long-term effects could be due to item-response memorization or the fake-to-real ratio of items presented, but found that this is not the case. We discuss implications for inoculation theory and psychological research on misinformation.

The dangerous issue is that misinformation, fake news, and rumours spread on social media faster than reliable information, and also faster than the virus itself, damaging the health systems and affecting the mental health of social media users. Objective: The current study aims at determining how social media affects the spread of panic about COVID-19 among primary and secondary school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. Methods: The data were collected through an online questionnaire. By utilizing convenience sampling, we have reached a total of 1067 school students, aged between 6 and 18 years, from 56 schools located in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. Independent Samples T-test, ANOVA, and chi-square tests were used to compare the data. Results: The results showed that social media has a significant impact on spreading panic about COVID-19 among school students, with a potential negative impact on their mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most common social media platform among students (81.8%), where female students had a higher likelihood than male students to use it to get news about COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Health news was the most frequently topic seen, read, or heard (n = 529, 56.2%) during the COVID-19 pandemic, where males were more likely to follow health news than females (p < 0.001). The majority of the students (n = 736, 78.1%) were psychologically affected, whereas those physically affected were the lowest (n = 12, 1.3%). Female students were psychologically affected and experienced greater fear significantly more than male students (p < 0.001). The effect of social media panic depending on a student's age and gender. (p < 0.001). This study showed a significant positive correlation between social media and spreading panic about COVID-19 (R = 0.891). Conclusions: During the closure of schools, students are using social media to continue their learning as well as to know more information about the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media has a main role in rapidly spreading of panic about the COVID-19 pandemic among students in the Gaza Strip. © 2020","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098549926"

However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that encourage endorsement of fake news remain unclear. The present study investigated cognitive decoupling/response inhibition and the potential role of conflict processing in the initiation of analytic thought about fake news as factors that may facilitate skepticism. A base-rate task was used to test the hypotheses that conflict processing deficits and inefficient response inhibition would be related to stronger endorsement of fake news. In support of these hypotheses, increased belief in fake (but not real) news was associated with a smaller decrease in response confidence in the presence (vs. absence) of conflict and with inefficient (in terms of response latency) inhibition of prepotent responses.

It is important that communicators are well prepared in identifying, preventing, and responding to such actions, in understanding the vulnerabilities of their audience, while respecting the rights and liberties of the population. Thus, ethical, and strategic communication should be of top priority for institutional communicators, academia, journalists, or stakeholders when addressing security or sensitive issues. The article presents the results of an empirical sociological study, part of an extensive exploratory research within the CRESCEnt project, aiming at identifying elements of enhancing critical thinking, responsible communication, and accountable behaviour. Three European states were targeted by the study: Romania, Spain, and Greece, while 28 practitioners in communication, intelligence and security and law enforcement contributed to the research with significant input on topics related to ethical, successful, and strategic communication characteristics. Ethical communication implies acting by ethical principles, like being truthful, accurate, and well-intentioned. Responsibility is the central element of ethical engagement when informing the public. Effective messages are characterized by clearness, validity of information, novelty and presented in real time. Different types of authorities come into action for the communicators, such as the journalism code of practice, European values, or possible negative social impact. © 2021 Scientific Association Icono14.

However, with a fast-growing population of mobile users, and the popularization of apps such as WhatsApp, misinformation has become much more pervasive across the continent. Researchers have shown that perceived exposure to false information is high in some African countries, and yet citizens often share made-up news intentionally. This article explores the motivations and contributing factors for sharing misinformation in six sub-Saharan African countries. Our analysis of 12 focus groups with university students reveals two common motivations: civic duty and fun. The sharing of political (dis)information was uneven, but common among students with high levels of self-reported political engagement. We also present an array of cues used to determine credibility, which often determines the shareability of information. Crossnational differences are also discussed.

However, this has also led to an increase in the preponderance of fake news. Widespread propagation of fake news can be detrimental to society, and this has created enormous interest in fake news detection on social media. Many approaches to fake news detection use the news content, social context, or both. In this work, we look at fake news detection as a problem of estimating the credibility of both the news publishers and users that propagate news articles. We introduce a new approach called the credibility score-based model that can jointly infer fake news and credibility scores for publishers and users. We use a state-of-the-art statistical relational learning framework called probabilistic soft logic to perform this joint inference effectively. We show that our approach is accurate at both fake news detection and inferring credibility scores. Further, our model can easily integrate any auxiliary information that can aid in fake news detection. Using the FakeNewsNet dataset, we show that our approach significantly outperforms previous approaches at fake news detection by up to 10% in recall and 4% in accuracy. Furthermore, the credibility scores learned for both publishers and users are representative of their true behavior. © 2020 Owner/Author.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095865258"

The analysis shows that while the Czech approach seems to be driven mostly by security interests, in Slovakia, the economic goals are of primary importance, with the primary factor being the importance of energy relations with Russia. The Czech approach is considered as an appropriate one in this paper, as it allows for more objective threat assessment and consequently better preparedness and resilience, whereas a rather pragmatic approach of Slovakia leads to increasing vulnerability of disinformation activities. ◎ 2021, University of Ljubljana.

By exam-ining research on motivations for sharing news information generally, and misinformation specifically, we derive a range of motivations that broaden current understandings of the sharing of misinformation to include factors that may to some extent mitigate the presumed dangers of misinformation for society. To illustrate the utility of our viewpoint we report data from a preliminary study of people’s dis/belief reactions to misinformation shared on social media using natural language processing. Analyses of over 2,5 million comments demonstrate that misinformation on social media is often disbelieved. These insights are leveraged to propose directions for future research that incorporate a more inclusive understanding of the various motivations and strategies for sharing misinformation socially in large-scale online networks. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101076263"

This study also considers whether social reactions, such as a “like” or an “angry” posted on correcting comments, will influence newsreaders’ perceptions and attitudes. Results from a survey experiment (N = 873) in the United States show that if comments that correct misinformation are uncivil, they led newsreaders to perceive the correcting comments and the commenters who posted them less favourably, although no effects on perceptions of the credibility of the news story itself were found. In addition, we found that uncivil correcting comments increased dislike for the political out-group in some instances unless they were marked with an “angry” social reaction. The “angry” reaction reversed the effect of the incivility, leading to decreased dislike for the out-group.

However, researchers know little about how differences in informedness affect how well corrective information helps individuals develop knowledge about current events. We introduce a Differential Informedness Model that distinguishes between three types of individuals, that is, the uninformed, the ambiguous, and the misinformed, and establish their differences with two experiments incorporating multiple partisan cues and issues. Contrary to the common impression, the U.S. public is largely uninformed rather than misinformed of a wide range of factual claims verified by journalists. Importantly, we find that the success of belief updating after exposure to corrective information (via a fact-checking article) is dependent on the presence, the certainty, and the accuracy of one’s prior belief. Uninformed individuals are more likely to update their beliefs than misinformed individuals after exposure to corrective information. Interestingly, the ambiguous individuals, regardless of whether their uncertain guesses were correct, do not differ from uninformed individuals with respect to belief updating. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Via two MTurk experiments, I tested a serial mediation process model predicting misinformation sharing from lexical concreteness, through psychological proximity and perceived threat. In Study 1, concrete misinformation primed psychological proximity which, in turn, increased perceived threat. Perceived threat then increased the likelihood that misinformation would be shared. Source credibility was also shown to positively influence misinformation sharing. Study 2 advanced this by showing this process was moderated by subjective knowledge. Specifically, the effect of perceived threat on misinformation sharing was stronger for those with higher subjective knowledge. Furthermore, the indirect effect of lexical concreteness on misinformation sharing was stronger for those with higher subjective knowledge.

Using the hierarchy of influence model trajectory with fake news, it was established that it has become almost impossible to sustain trust and credibility through individual influences on online news content. The primary reason is that journalists are constrained by professional ethics, organizational routines, and ownership influence.

We examine this possibility by using a quasi-experimental design to compare how low- and high-quality evidence is evaluated by those who do and do not endorse implausible claims. Seven studies conducted during 2019–2020 provided the data for this analysis (N = 746). Each of the seven primary studies presented participants with high- and/or low-quality evidence and measured implausible claim endorsement and evaluations of evidence persuasiveness (via credibility, value, and/or weight). A linear mixed-effect model was used to predict persuasiveness from the interaction between implausible claim endorsement and evidence quality. Our results showed that endorsers were significantly more persuaded by the evidence than non-endorsers, but both groups were significantly more persuaded by high-quality than low-quality evidence. The interaction between endorsement and evidence quality was not significant. These results suggest that the formation and maintenance of implausible beliefs by endorsers may result from less critical evidence evaluations rather than a failure to analyse. This is consistent with a limited rather than a lazy approach and suggests that interventions to develop analytical skill may be useful for minimising the effects of implausible claims. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098471629"

Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated.

The widespread flourishing of conspiracy theories in this context has prompted much interest from the academic community. There is often an expectation that it is the responsibility of researchers to engage with conspiracy beliefs by debunking them. However, like everything that relates to conspiracy theories, even the subject of debunking is not straightforward. An answer to the question as to whether researchers should debunk conspiracy theories varies across disciplines and schools, and is closely related to specific ethical codes of conduct, research methodologies, and specific approaches to conspiracy theories. While scholars who study this cultural phenomenon from a non-normative and epistemologically neutral position might wish to refrain from debunking conspiracy theories, others who see conspiracy theories as the irrational, overly suspicious and even dangerous ideas of people who don’t quite understand what is ‘really’ going on, might lean towards the debunking stance.

The four message frames examined in this study included legislation of funding, election, women’s human rights, and sports. In general, we discovered that misinformation about Zika did not outperform true information about Zika in terms of generating more retweets or attracting more users. However, on average, the retweet networks of misinformation about Zika had larger network diameter and higher structural virality than those of true information about Zika. Except for the sports frame, using any of the other three frames engaged more users in retweeting information about Zika than not using any frame, regardless of information accuracy. We also found that the four frames varied in their respective capacities of moderating the impact of information veracity on the dissemination of tweets about Zika.

Recent studies examining the content of corrective messages provide mixed results—several studies suggest that politer, hedged messages may increase engagement with corrections, while others favor direct messaging which does not shed doubt on the credibility of the corrective message. Furthermore, common debunking strategies often include keeping the message simple and clear, while others recommend including a detailed explanation of why the initial misinformation is incorrect. To shed more light on how correction style affects correction efficacy, we manipulated both correction strength (direct, hedged) and explanatory depth (simple explanation, detailed explanation) in response to participants from Lucid (N = 2,228) who indicated they would share a false story in a survey experiment. We found minimal evidence suggesting that correction strength or depth affects correction engagement, both in terms of likelihood of replying, and accepting or resisting corrective information. However, we do find that analytic thinking and actively open-minded thinking are associated with greater acceptance of information in response to corrective messages, regardless of correction style.

Along with this pandemic, we are also experiencing an ""infodemic"" of information with low credibility such as fake news and conspiracies. In this work, we present ReCOVery, a repository designed and constructed to facilitate research on combating such information regarding COVID-19. We first broadly search and investigate ∼2,000 news publishers, from which 60 are identified with extreme [high or low] levels of credibility. By inheriting the credibility of the media on which they were published, a total of 2,029 news articles on coronavirus, published from January to May 2020, are collected in the repository, along with 140,820 tweets that reveal how these news articles have spread on the Twitter social network. The repository provides multimodal information of news articles on coronavirus, including textual, visual, temporal, and network information. The way that news credibility is obtained allows a trade-off between dataset scalability and label accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to present data statistics and distributions, as well as to provide baseline performances for predicting news credibility so that future methods can be compared.

This study examined the relationship between COVID-19 related knowledge and mental health in a Croatian sample of participants. Methods: An online survey was conducted from March 18 until March 23, 2020, and a total of 1244 participant responses were collected (85.5% were women and 58.4% completed secondary education). Measures included eight questions regarding biological features of the virus, symptoms, and prevention, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Optimism-Pessimism Scale. According to the answers given on the questions on COVID-19 related knowledge, participants were divided in two groups: (1) informed and (2) uninformed on each question. They were then compared in the expressed levels of anxiety, depression, pessimism, and optimism. Full vs. partial mediation models with optimism/pessimism as a mediator in the relationship between anxiety/depression and the accuracy of responses for questions about handwashing and ways of transmission were estimated. Results: Participants who responded correctly on the question about handwashing had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and pessimism than those participants whose answer was incorrect, while participants who answered correctly on the question about the percentage of patients who develop serious breathing problems had higher levels of depression than those who answered incorrectly. Lower levels of anxiety and pessimism were observed in the participants who answered correctly about ways of transmission. Higher levels of pessimism were found in participants who scored incorrectly on questions about the efficiency of antibiotics, most common symptoms, and the possibility of being infected by asymptomatic carriers. Higher levels of knowledge about handwashing were predicted by higher levels of anxiety and pessimism. Higher levels of knowledge about ways of transmission were predicted by lower levels of anxiety and lower levels of pessimism. The examined relationships between anxiety/depression and knowledge were mediated by pessimism. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that knowledge about COVID-19 may be useful to reduce anxiety and depression, but it must be directed to the promotion of health behaviors and to the recognition of fake news. © Copyright © 2020 Galić, Mustapić, Šimunić, Sić and Cipolletta.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097512780"

How do the partisan loyalties and democratic values of citizens influence these choices? This article formally analyzes incumbent abuse in democracies, the most common modern initiator of democratic breakdown. If an incumbent attempts to consolidate power, the opposition can try to rally protest but can also cry wolf without incumbent abuse. In a democratic equilibrium, incumbents avoid abuse, the opposition calls for protest if and only if abuse occurs, and citizens protest in sufficient numbers to deter elites. Results show that non-winner-take-all institutions, high media accuracy, low partisanship, and citizen support for democracy typically promote democratic survival. However, under some conditions, higher democracy support can threaten democracy. Model extensions allow incumbents to pursue democratic erosion instead of full breakdown, promote “fake news,” and strategically inflame partisanship.

This study, thus, included the Latin American context in fact-checking journalism studies as a journalistic practice to fight political disinformation. Through analyzing RedCheq, the first fact-checking journalism alliance in an electoral regional context led by Colombiacheck, 11 in-depth interviews were conducted to identify the perceptions of regional fact-checkers regarding the usefulness of this journalistic practice, its achievements, and the key aspects for incorporating fact-checking into the regional media ecosystem. The study results revealed that RedCheq achieved the goal of fighting disinformation, and that fact-checking developed as transformational leverage for the regional media. Regional journalists perceived fact-checking as an element that restores credibility and social trust in regional media as the epistemology of this journalistic practice neglects the power pressure and dissemination of official narratives. Finally, this study highlighted how fact-checking journalism contributes to the democratic quality and civic empowerment in silenced and polarized environments. In addition, it discussed the need to expand fact-checking journalism’s coverage to new geographical areas and improve journalists’ professional competencies and training, thereby enabling them to function as using verification tools based on regional journalists’ requirements. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102902901"

Should campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S. adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n = 1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n = 889; follow-up response 83%). Scales were developed and validated for COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors. Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated with both face mask wearing (B = −.27, SE =.06) and social-distancing behaviors (B = −.46, SE =.08) measured at the same time, misinformation did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both cross-sectionally (B =.43, SE =.05; B =.63, SE =.09) and lagged over time (B =.20, SE = 04; B =.30, SE =.08). In conclusion, belief in COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096449730"

The author considers post-truth as an environment of multiple information influences, which is a product of the Internet and, especially, social networking. Post-political communication differs from propaganda in such properties as demassification and individualization, differentiation, and the variability of information flows; it cannot be guided by mainstream mass media arguments that are manipulated by governments and corporations. An analysis of empirical research data suggests that posttruth perception is a natural process of post-rationalism, due to the fact that in the era of the Internet, the volume of information and its speed exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. In a situation of stress caused by information overabundance, people rely on their emotions related to their core beliefs. Under these conditions, personal moral values have become an influential force in the selection of sources, as well as in the interactive processes of reacting to and producing information. Having gained a greater degree of freedom in the information space and becoming the subject of the communication process, an individual assumes the greater degree of responsibility for political decision making. Moral values, which are interpreted and experienced by subjects in different ways, become the basis of communication and subsequent social structuring in a network society. The author concludes that the modality of post-truth reflects multiple deep individual value attitudes. Post-politics is distinguished by its anthropocentricity and orientation toward a personal axiological code. In a multimodal communication space, it is implemented as a network game. In a network society, post-truth policy is based on the patterns of online networks’ functioning and development. In the multimodal communication field, post-politics is carried out as a network game. Through this game, the social actors with the most attractiveness and the highest level of co-participation get the opportunity to convert their communication influence into political power. © 2021.

We analysed more than 100 million Twitter messages posted worldwide during the early stages of epidemic spread across countries (from 22 January to 10 March 2020) and classified the reliability of the news being circulated. We developed an Infodemic Risk Index to capture the magnitude of exposure to unreliable news across countries. We found that measurable waves of potentially unreliable information preceded the rise of COVID-19 infections, exposing entire countries to falsehoods that pose a serious threat to public health. As infections started to rise, reliable information quickly became more dominant, and Twitter content shifted towards more credible informational sources.

Several studies point to knowledge about the virus, trust in government officials, and trust in scientists as reliable predictors of social distancing, yet the exact nature of the relations between these predictor variables remains unexplored. Examining these relations in a study involving 998 participants, we found that less trust in former President Trump’s ability to guide the nation through the COVID-19 crisis and greater trust in scientists predicted greater COVID-19 knowledge. In turn, greater COVID-19 knowledge predicted greater social-distancing behavior, and did so most strongly among those who reported (1) relatively low levels of trust in Trump and (2) relatively high levels of trust in scientists. These findings add a layer of complexity to our understanding of how knowledge about an issue and trust in authority figures shape behavior, suggesting that in addition to predicting the amount of knowledge people have on a certain issue, trust may play role in influencing the perceived validity of that knowledge as a basis for behavior.

Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study was predictive of greater belief in fake (but not real) news posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092188429"

In Indonesia, digital activism has successfully supported social and political change in recent years. Motivation is an important component of digital activism that can stimulate movements, and can be determined by access to and use of digital media. This article presents a case study of motivations and digital activism in an online political movement in Indonesia through interviews and focus group discussions with fifty-two (n = 52) Indonesian young people (activists and students) who were familiar with digital media and the Save KPK 2015 movement in Indonesia. It investigates the digital activism of the Save KPK movement and the strategies employed to support the movement. The case study offers a deeper understanding of the Save KPK movement (which aimed to support an institution dedicated to eradicating corruption in Indonesia) and provides insights into the motivations of activists who digitally supported the political movement. Its findings explore how internal factors such as experience and beliefs fundamentally influenced young Indonesians to participate in the Save KPK movement using digital media, indicating that intrinsic is an important factor in delivering credible information and participating in the movement. Delivering truthful information about the KPK institution through digital media was seen as vital to combat the distribution of misinformation, such as fake news or hoaxes, and reinforce the political participation that helps to sustain Indonesian democracy as well as that of other democratic countries. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059751638"

Given that part of the social contract of science is the betterment of society, it is critical for the scientific community to identify factors underlying public dismissal versus support of scientific evidence. The current study explores how individual differences in political ideology influence acceptance of factual and nonfactual information, with differences in truth-seeking values as a potential mediating variable. Participants rated their agreement with true and untrue (i.e., nonempirically supported) statements and completed self-report assessments of political ideology and personal endorsement of values associated with promoting truth. More politically, liberal individuals reported greater agreement with both scientific facts and untrue statements. Furthermore, endorsement of truth-seeking values mediated the relation between liberal ideology and agreement with facts (but not nonfactual statements). Results suggest that interventions to increase individuals’ acceptance of facts may benefit from stimulating greater support for truth-seeking values and behavior. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075354358"

Religious leaders may play an important role in providing sexual and reproductive health pastoral care given a long history of supporting healing and health promotion. Methods We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Mainline and Black Protestant religious leaders on their attitudes toward abortion and how they provide pastoral care for abortion. The study was conducted in a county with relatively higher rates of abortion, lower access to sexual and reproductive health services, higher religiosity, and greater denominational diversity compared to other counties in the state. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by thematic analysis. Results Religious leaders’ attitudes towards abortion fell on a spectrum from “pro-life” to “pro-choice”. However, most participants expressed attitudes in the middle of this spectrum and described more nuanced, complex, and sometimes contradictory views. Differences in abortion attitudes stemmed from varying beliefs on when life begins and circumstances in which abortion may be morally acceptable. Religious leaders described their pastoral care on abortion as “journeying with” congregants by advising them to make well-informed decisions irrespective of the religious leader’s own attitudes. However, many religious leaders described a lack of preparation and training to have these conversations. Leaders emphasized not condoning abortion, yet being willing to emotionally support women because spiritual leaders are compelled to love and provide pastoral care. Paradoxically, all leaders emphasized the importance of empathy and compassion for people who have unplanned pregnancies, yet only leaders whose attitudes were “pro-choice” or in the middle of the spectrum expressed an obligation to confront stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors towards people who experience abortion. Additionally, many leaders offer misinformation about abortion when offering pastoral care. Conclusion These findings contribute to limited empirical evidence on pastoral care for abortion. We found religious leaders hold diverse attitudes and beliefs about abortion, rooted in Christian scripture and doctrine that inform advice and recommendations to congregants. While religious leaders may have formal training on pastoral care in general or theological education on the ethical issues related to abortion, they struggle to integrate their knowledge and training across these two areas. Still, leaders could be potentially important resources for empathy, compassion, and affirmation of agency in abortion decision-making, particularly in the Southern United States. © 2020 Dozier et al.

Very recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to scale up labeling efforts: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that is still ongoing at the time of the study and has arguably caused an increase of the amount of misinformation that is spreading online (a phenomenon for which the term ""infodemic"" has been used). By doing so, we are able to address (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal issue like health and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done: two issues that have not been analyzed in related work. In our experiment, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, as well as to provide evidence for the assessments as a URL and a text justification. Besides showing that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we also report results on many different aspects, including: agreement among workers, the effect of different aggregation functions, of scales transformations, and of workers background / bias. We also analyze workers behavior, in terms of queries submitted, URLs found / selected, text justifications, and other behavioral data like clicks and mouse actions collected by means of an ad hoc logger. © 2020 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095865160"

As a collection of handwritten prognostication texts that contain sources of political disinformation against the Choson dynasty, the Chong Kam nok was widely read and transmitted by word of mouth across the country from the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. The book foretold the fall of the Yi royal house and the founding of a new regime by a ""true man"" whose surname was Chong. When Choson Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, however, that prognostic claim turned out to be false because it was the Japanese, rather than a man named Chong, who overthrew the dynasty. Although the Chong Kam nok's predictions were wildly inaccurate, many Koreans still believed its radical message and reinterpreted it for their own political ends during the colonial period. Both Japanese authorities and Korean reformers vilified the Chong Kam nok as a superstitious tradition and suppressed its oral influence through various measures. Despite state persecution, the Chong Kam nok survived and provided discontented Koreans under colonial rule with a redemptive vision of the future and an ideological basis for their struggle for national independence. While previous studies have analyzed the textual meanings of the Chong Kam nok and examined its impact on peasant uprisings in premodern Korea, this article illuminates the complicated dynamics of colonial power and discourse surrounding the Chong Kam nok, a text that remained deeply embedded in the popular beliefs of the Korean people. © 2020 University of Hawaii Press.

Collaborative and nominal pairs viewed a video-clip illustrating a bank robbery, provided an immediate free recall, were forced to confabulate answers to false-event questions, and, after a short- (1 h: Experiment 1) or a long-term delay (1 week: Experiment 2), were administered a yes/no recognition task in which the misleading statements either matched the questions presented in the confabulation phase (answered questions) or not (control questions). Collaborative pairs recalled fewer correct details in the immediate free recall task, replicating the negative effects of collaborative inhibition. Most importantly, in the final recognition test, collaborative pairs were less likely to provide false assents to misleading statements, regardless of whether they had provided a response to the related false-event questions 1 h or 1 week earlier. Our results suggest that collaboration can increase the eyewitnesses' tendency to check the accuracy of others' responses and reject false memories through discussion. © 2019 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076885533"

This represents a threat to the vital forums of democracy and a new challenge for journalism education: How to equip future journalists with the critical thinking and technology skills they need to produce and/or share content that is independent, accurate, and fair, while developing relationships with audiences that reflect accountability, respect, and understanding. Journalists also need to learn how to identify situations that call for careful consideration of audience confirmation biases and accordingly to present important information, such as on vaccines, in a manner less likely to trigger those biases.

The crux of my argument is that social media simultaneously serves as a distribution platform and reputation builder, as social recommendations take the place of expensive investments in high-quality journalism. This development rendered crucial portions of previous models of the market for news inaccurate due to the declining importance of firm reputation. This mechanism interacts with the massive heterogeneity in digital literacy and growing animosity toward the news media among conservatives to create “credibility cascades,” which I argue are a necessary condition for Fake News to flourish. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076108365"

Here, we investigated whether effects of perceptual load on eyewitness memory for a simulated crime are moderated by individual differences in cognitive ability. We presented participants with a video of a simulated crime that imposed either high or low perceptual load, followed by a written narrative which contained a mixture of neutral and misleading descriptions of critical details. We examined the effects of three cognitive variables (working memory capacity, verbal cognitive ability and analytical reasoning) on participants’ ability to accurately recall details of the video in both the misinformation and control conditions, and to detect a change in the clothing of a main character. General cognitive ability was associated with improved global memory for details of the event, and enhanced change detection under load. Greater WM capacity and a tendency towards analytical reasoning were both associated with resistance to misinformation under conditions of high perceptual load. We conclude that higher levels of cognitive ability, assessed across a number of domains, may enable eyewitnesses to withstand the effects of perceptual load and preserve the accuracy of their memories. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079701405"

However, it is unclear what the most effective format of fact-checks is. Some have argued that simple retractions that repeat a false claim and tag it as false may backfire because they boost the claim's familiarity. More detailed refutations may provide a more promising approach, but may not be feasible under the severe space constraints associated with social-media communication. In two experiments, we tested whether (1) simple ‘false-tag’ retractions can indeed be ineffective or harmful; and (2) short-format (140-character) refutations are more effective than simple retractions. Regarding (1), simple retractions reduced belief in false claims, and we found no evidence for a familiarity-driven backfire effect. Regarding (2), short-format refutations were found to be more effective than simple retractions after a 1-week delay but not a one-day delay. At both delays, however, they were associated with reduced misinformation-congruent reasoning. © 2019 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A dichotomy is presented examining the role of “Schemer’s Schema” transparency by confirmatory bias. Findings: Consumers will react differently to fake news depending on their “schemer schema” and the source of the information, as well as the believability of the story based on already existing beliefs. Research implications/limitations: This paper provides readers with a strategy to address the prevalence and reality of fake news. The purpose of this paper is theoretical in nature.

An acute form of this problem is that children and adolescents tend to include the use of new technologies in all the aspects of their daily life, yet most of them are unable to distinguish between fake news and trustful information in an online environment. This study is based on a Dutch empirical study and was conducted in Romania to examine whether schoolchildren and adolescents were able to identify a hoax website as fake, using a self-administrative questionnaire and open group discussions about the given online source. Similar to other studies based on the same research design, this research aims to explore the vulnerability of students to fake news and the way they experience an experimental situation in which they are exposed to online fake information. This exploratory study revealed that both children and adolescents are not preoccupied with the trustworthiness of the information they are exposed to in social media. While only 4 of the 54 students stated that they would not choose to save a fake animal (from a hoax website), all four of them had reasons that proved that they did not perceive the information as being a hoax. Thus, participants proved that they would act upon being exposed to fake information even when they do not trust the source. © 2020 by the author.

Past research has shown that people sometimes continue to use this misinformation in their reasoning, even if they remember that the information is false, which researchers refer to as the continued influence effect. The current work shows that the continued influence effect depends on the stories people have in memory: corrected misinformation was found to have a stronger effect on people's beliefs than information that was topically related to the story if it helped to provide a causal explanation of a story they had read previously. We argue this effect occurs because information that can fill a causal “gap” in a story enhances comprehension of the story event, which allows people to build a complete (if inaccurate) event model that they prefer over an accurate but incomplete event model. This effect is less likely to occur for stories in memory that end in a negative way, presumably because people are more motivated to accurately understand negative outcome events. © 2019 Society for Consumer Psychology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071391874"

Objective: Because the novel coronavirus is highly contagious, the widespread use of preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and eventually vaccination is needed to bring it under control. We hypothesized that accepting conspiracy theories that were circulating in mainstream and social media early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US would be negatively related to the uptake of preventive behaviors and also of vaccination when a vaccine becomes available. Method: A national probability survey of US adults (N = 1050) was conducted in the latter half of March 2020 and a follow-up with 840 of the same individuals in July 2020. The surveys assessed adoption of preventive measures recommended by public health authorities, vaccination intentions, conspiracy beliefs, perceptions of threat, belief about the safety of vaccines, political ideology, and media exposure patterns. Results: Belief in three COVID-19-related conspiracy theories was highly stable across the two periods and inversely related to the (a) perceived threat of the pandemic, (b) taking of preventive actions, including wearing a face mask, (c) perceived safety of vaccination, and (d) intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conspiracy beliefs in March predicted subsequent mask-wearing and vaccination intentions in July even after controlling for action taken and intentions in March. Although adopting preventive behaviors was predicted by political ideology and conservative media reliance, vaccination intentions were less related to political ideology. Mainstream television news use predicted adopting both preventive actions and vaccination. Conclusions: Because belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the US. Reducing those barriers will require continued messaging by public health authorities on mainstream media and in particular on politically conservative outlets that have supported COVID-related conspiracy theories. © 2020 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092533417"

The rapid spread of online misinformation poses challenges to brand managers, whose brands are cocreated online, sometimes to the detriment of the brand. There is a need to identify the information sources that are likely to be trustworthy and to promote positive consumer attitudes toward brands. The data for this study were taken from a Flash Eurobarometer of 26,576 respondents across 28 European countries. Cluster analysis and partial least squares structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data and unveil users' attitudes toward fake news. The findings show that users' attitudes toward fake news differ among European countries. Younger and tech-savvy users are more likely to recognize fake news and are consequently able to evaluate digital information sources without relying on policy interventions to limit the impact of fake news. Brand managers can use the findings of this study to better understand different kinds of users' susceptibility to fake news and reshape their social media branding strategies accordingly. It is hoped that this paper will encourage further research on brand management in relation to fake news and promote the widespread adoption of best practices in social media communication. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081742254"

The Motivated System 2 Reasoning (MS2R) account posits that deliberation causes people to fall for fake news, because reasoning facilitates identity-protective cognition and is therefore used to rationalize content that is consistent with one's political ideology. The classical account of reasoning instead posits that people ineffectively discern between true and false news headlines when they fail to deliberate (and instead rely on intuition). To distinguish between these competing accounts, we investigated the causal effect of reasoning on media truth discernment using a 2-response paradigm. Participants (N 1,635 Mechanical Turkers) were presented with a series of headlines. For each, they were first asked to give an initial, intuitive response under time pressure and concurrent working memory load. They were then given an opportunity to rethink their response with no constraints, thereby permitting more deliberation. We also compared these responses to a (deliberative) 1-response baseline condition where participants made a single choice with no constraints. Consistent with the classical account, we found that deliberation corrected intuitive mistakes: Participants believed false headlines (but not true headlines) more in initial responses than in either final responses or the unconstrained 1-response baseline. In contrast-and inconsistent with the Motivated System 2 Reasoning account-we found that political polarization was equivalent across responses. Our data suggest that, in the context of fake news, deliberation facilitates accurate belief formation and not partisan bias. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078609227"

The number of false news stories generated with the intention of spreading either disinformation or ""malinformation"" (targeting reputation of political candidates) typically increase dramatically during election campaign periods. As such, before the 2018 presidential elections in Turkey, in which Tayyip Erdogan won by getting nearly 53% of the votes and got new executive powers, a heated debate between the two opposing camps of the election campaign not only spread to the digital platforms, but also the false news in digital platforms were used in different proportions in the political campaigns. The Turkish news verification initiative teyit.org had detected 29 major different false news claims in circulation across the social media in the two-month period before the elections. However, among 136 social media accounts, which circulate these claims that reach hundreds of thousands of people, not all are anonymous or a ""troll"" social media accounts. In fact, considerable percentage of those accounts belong to well-known news outlets, which take viral social media content as a news source without verifying. In this chapter, the aim is to demonstrate the spread of information disorder in an election period through internet news sites by analyzing the raw data gathered by teyit.org. Emphasis will also be given to the ""correction"" or removal rates of false news from these sites after verification proves them false in order to understand the spillover effect and the ""survival"" rate of disinformation against truth. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the theoretical mechanism by which correction can occur and the practical guidelines to best correct misinformation in visual social media spaces. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085388027"

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants’ exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information.

Hence, the purpose of this study is to shed light on the effectiveness of the crisis response strategies of denial and attack in addressing rumors about consumer privacy when non-profit organizations are targeted on social media. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, a 2 (response type: denial vs attack) × 2 (privacy concerns: low vs high), between-group online experiment was conducted via Qualtrics. Findings: The results indicated that one’s involvement level in the issue determines the effectiveness of the crisis response strategy. Data showed that attacking the source of fake news (as a crisis response) reduces the message’s credibility more than denying fake news. Furthermore, highly involved individuals are more likely to centrally process information and develop positive supportive intentions toward the affected non-profit brand. High issue involvement also predicted organizational and response credibility. Conversely, an attack rebuttal message increased the credibility of the circulated malicious rumors for low involved individuals. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that issue involvement plays a key role in message perceptions of false information regarding consumer privacy in social media. Practical implications: Practically, this study offers insights for organizations that are developing response strategies in the current environment of fake news. Findings from this study suggest that organizations need to consider the degree to which audiences are currently involved in an issue before deciding how aggressively to respond to perpetrators of fake news. Originality/value: The present study examines the intersection of fake news and crisis management in the non-profit sector, with an emphasis on various response strategies and issue involvement. This is one of the first attempts to experimentally investigate how social media strategies can defend and protect non-profit reputation in the fake news era. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075397193"

Our study is the first to examine whether children are influenced by the presence of inaccuracies contained in webpages when deciding which sources to trust. Forty-eight 8- to 10-year-olds viewed three pairs of webpages, relating to the same topics, where one webpage per pair contained three obvious inaccuracies (factual, typographical, or exaggerations, according to condition). The paired webpages offered conflicting claims about two novel facts. We asked participants questions pertaining to the novel facts to assess whether they systematically selected answers from the accurate sources. Selective trust in the accurate webpage was found in the typos condition only. This study highlights the limitations of 8- to 10-year-olds in critically evaluating the accuracy of webpage content and indicates a potential focus for educational intervention. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Children display early epistemic vigilance towards spoken testimony. They use speakers’ past accuracy when deciding whom to trust regarding novel information. Little is known about children’s selective trust towards web-based sources. What does this study add? This study is the first to examine whether textual inaccuracy affects children’s trust in webpages. Typos but not semantic errors led to reduced trust in a webpage compared to an accurate source.

This work aims to understand the thought of the youth, their opinions and understanding of various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: Using a combined qualitative–quantitative approach, Q-method, we tried to assess people's discernment from different perspectives. This was done through a questionnaire survey method during the national-level lockdown 1.0 in India. Results: We have differentiated the perceptions of youth respondents into seven factors, including six subdimensions, on COVID-19 pandemic (viz., science, society, environment, economy, politics, and religion). The choices and opinions have been segregated into two major groups: quantitative and qualitative. Conclusion: This work yielded a firsthand ground-level insight into the comprehensive yet diverse responses from youths regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in India. There are various topics that arise from this study, for example, misinformation, misinterpretation of science, dubious nature of faith in governance and policy, turbid understanding of strategy, polarization of opinion, and so forth.

Therefore, social media users should not simply believe the information they received. This paper investigates the process of evaluating news on social media carried out by students in assessing the news they find on social media, and their ability to distinguish fact and false news. Purpose: It is to find out more about the process of students evaluating news on social media by assessing the news they found on social media, and how can they know which is the factual news and which is the fake news and the difference between them. Method: Qualitative research methods with a descriptive approach are used in this research. This research was conducted at Gadjah Mada University. The purposive sampling technique was chosen to be used in determining students. Findings: Overall, participants were able to identify almost all news articles. Participants are able to identify almost all factual news articles correctly and most fake news articles correctly. Only a small portion of all news articles cannot be correctly identified by participants. Participants are better to identify factual news than fake news. Conclusion: Although participants already have experienced finding fake news on social media and have self-taught knowledge about how to distinguish fake news from reliable news, there is no guarantee that they can tell the news article they got, fake or fact. The researcher wants to give advice to the academic library to provide training on the characteristics of reliable referral sources and to think critically in assessing information as part of student information literacy training. © 2020, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.

We tested the possibility that fake-news claims are appealing because they satisfy the need to see the world as structured. Believing that news organizations are involved in an orchestrated disinformation campaign implies a more orderly world than believing that the news is prone to random errors. Across six studies (N > 2,800), individuals with dispositionally high or situationally increased need for structure were more likely to attribute contested news stories to intentional deception than to journalistic incompetence. The effect persisted for stories that were ideologically consistent and ideologically inconsistent and after analyses controlled for strength of political identification. Political orientation showed a moderating effect; specifically, the link between need for structure and belief in intentional deception was stronger for Republican participants than for Democratic participants.

The purpose of this article is to provide a more advanced understanding of the underlying processes that contribute to the spread of health- and beauty-related rumors and of the mechanisms that can mitigate the risks associated with the diffusion of fake news. Design/methodology/approach: By adopting denialism as a conceptual lens, this article introduces a framework that aims to explain the mechanisms through which fake news and pseudo-facts propagate within the health and beauty industry. Three exemplary case studies situated within the context of the health and beauty industry reveal the persuasiveness of these principles and shed light on the diffusion of false and misleading information. Findings: The following seven denialistic marketing tactics that contribute to diffusion of fake news can be identified: (1) promoting a socially accepted image; (2) associating brands with a healthy lifestyle; (3) use of experts; (4) working with celebrity influencers; (5) selectively using and omitting facts; (6) sponsoring research and pseudo-science; and (7)exploiting regulatory loopholes. Through a better understanding of how fake news spreads, brand managers can simultaneously improve the optics that surround their firms, promote sales organically and reinforce consumers’ trust toward the brand. Originality/value: Within the wider context of the health and beauty industry, this article sets to explore the mechanisms through which fake news and pseudo-facts propagate and influence brands and consumers.

Between each phase of the experiment, they performed a task that either induced anger or maintained a neutral mood. Participants showed greater susceptibility to schema-consistent than schema-irrelevant misinformation. Anger did not affect either recognition or source accuracy for true details about the initial event, but suggestibility for false details increased with anger.

Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component. © 2020 Eastern Sociological Society","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084449415"

We investigate the psychological profile of individuals who fall prey to fake news. Method: We recruited 1,606 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for three online surveys. Results: The tendency to ascribe profundity to randomly generated sentences—pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity—correlates positively with perceptions of fake news accuracy, and negatively with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news (media truth discernment). Relatedly, individuals who overclaim their level of knowledge also judge fake news to be more accurate. We also extend previous research indicating that analytic thinking correlates negatively with perceived accuracy by showing that this relationship is not moderated by the presence/absence of the headline’s source (which has no effect on accuracy), or by familiarity with the headlines (which correlates positively with perceived accuracy of fake and real news). Conclusion: Our results suggest that belief in fake news may be driven, to some extent, by a general tendency to be overly accepting of weak claims. This tendency, which we refer to as reflexive open-mindedness, may be partly responsible for the prevalence of epistemically suspect beliefs writ large. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064526969"

Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participants' level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with selfreported likelihood of sharing.

The results provide evidence in favor of partisan cueing: When alternative narratives are endorsed by political parties viewed favorably by the respondent, they are more likely to be believed.

Also, the received information can be distorted by psychological biases. This is problematic especially in health-related communications which can greatly affect the quality of life of individuals. We assembled and analyzed 364 texts related to nutrition and health from Finnish online sources, such as news, columns and blogs, and asked non-experts to subjectively evaluate the texts. Texts were rated for their trustworthiness, sentiment, logic, information, clarity, and neutrality properties. We then estimated individual biases and consensus ratings that were used in training regression models. Firstly, we found that trustworthiness was significantly correlated to the information, neutrality and logic of the texts. Secondly, individual ratings for information and logic were significantly biased by the age and diet of the raters. Our best regression models explained up to 70% of the total variance of consensus ratings based on the low-level properties of texts, such as semantic embeddings, presence of keyterms and part-of-speech tags, references, quotes and paragraphs. With a novel combination of crowdsourcing, behavioral analysis, natural language processing and predictive modeling, our study contributes to the automated identification of reliable and high-quality online information. While critical evaluation of truthfulness cannot be surrendered to the machine only, our findings provide new insights into automated evaluation of subjective text properties and analysis of morphologically-rich languages in regards to trustworthiness. © 2020 Kauttonen et al.

While previous studies have already demonstrated the RSA's effectiveness in reducing other memory distortions (e.g., the misinformation effect and interrogative suggestibility), this has not been tested in the context of the co-witness memory conformity effect. To this end, we will utilize the well-known MORI technique to study co-witness memory conformity under well-controlled experimental conditions. While viewing different versions of the same movie, pairs of participants will sit beside each other, believing that they are viewing the same version. Next, they will answer questions collaboratively, which will guide them to discuss conflicting details. Finally, participants will take a recognition test individually, but in the experimental condition, this will be proceeded by the RSA procedure, which is expected to be an effective way of eliminating the effect of memory conformity. If reinforcing one's own confidence reduces the plausible memory conformity effect, it may be then argued that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is the participants' lack of confidence relating to quality of their memory.

While purposefully developed online services for fact-checking and overall reliability of news may be helpful in some situations, personal abilities to recognize manipulation and misinformation according to its certain characteristics and owing to certain individual skills and competencies appear to be more important. This chapter introduces the concept of 'manipulated media information' and is focused on the investigation of the effects of individual levels of political competence and the media literacy context on spotting manipulated information in Internet news reports on foreign affairs issues as well as on the acceptance/rejection dichotomy of the standpoint(s) such news reports promote. The basis of the investigation is a series of experiments (N = 914) conducted in three European countries, differing in their levels of media literacy context - Austria, Italy, and the Netherlands. University students in the age category of 18-26 years old, which is usually referred to as 'heavy Internet users,' from the three countries were the target group of participants in this research. Analysis revealed that political competence appeared to have no effects at all on spotting and rejecting manipulated information both in 'traditional' and 'alternative' Internet news sources. However, participants from countries ranked with a higher media literacy context were more likely to spot manipulation and reject the promoted standpoint(s). In addition, a puzzling relationship was discovered between spotting and rejecting, as not everyone who spotted manipulation subsequently rejected the manipulated standpoint, but accepted it instead. The chapter discusses these findings as well as other factors, particularly, media trust and sources' trustworthiness, within the context of manipulated information. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Berlin 2020.

To explore this worrisome phenomenon, this study aims to investigate the effects of political misinformation by integrating three theoretical approaches: (1) misinformation, (2) polarization, and (3) selective exposure. In this article, we examine the role of fact-checkers in discrediting polarized misinformation in a fragmented media environment. We rely on two experiments (N = 1,117) in which we vary exposure to attitudinal-congruent or incongruent political news and a follow-up fact-check article debunking the information. Participants were either forced to see or free to select a fact-checker. Results show that fact-checkers can be successful as they (1) lower agreement with attitudinally congruent political misinformation and (2) can overcome political polarization. Moreover, dependent on the issue, fact-checkers are most likely to be selected when they confirm prior attitudes and avoided when they are incongruent, indicating a confirmation bias for selecting corrective information. The freedom to select or avoid fact-checkers does not have an impact on political beliefs. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060606513"

There has been a corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate. Social media platforms are conduits of both information and misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a nationally representative survey of parents in the United States informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics, including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from 2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in 2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and scores of the first principal components obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs. volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as assessing belief covariation. Copyright: © 2020 Nowak et al.

Online version of a photograph of Grace de Guzman. Photograph courtesy of Eloisa Lopez. Duterte, Overseas Filipino Workers, and the Ethics of Representation Ethel Tungohan Although the problem persists I really do believe the photographs put a face to the numbers. They allowed more people to witness the harrowing things we saw. More organizations were spurred to action from the reporting. None of this would have come to light if not for the very first wave of local reporters saying: this really is happening. —­ Hannah Reyes Morales, “Coming Home to Cover Duterte’s Deadly Drug War” Consisting primarily of former and current migrant workers who came to Canada under the low-­ skilled Temporary Foreign Workers Program (TFWP), members of the Filipino diaspora in Edmonton, Alberta, have oftentimes expressed to me their disillusionment with the way politics was conducted back home, the economic conditions that led them to 14 Codex seek jobs abroad in the first place, and the sacrifices they underwent in Canada. Living and working in Canada did not mean that they were uninvolved with events in the Philippines. On the contrary, being migrant workers abroad with obligations to send remittances to family and other loved ones in the Philippines meant that they maintained transnational ties. I actually first heard about Rodrigo Duterte first announcing his candidacy for president from them. Despite favorable media depictions of the progress former president Benigno Aquino Jr. has made, which included “rapid economic growth of 6.9% and improved performance in global competitiveness rankings (from 86th place to 47th)” (Curato 2017, 144), many of those with whom I spoke were disillusioned. The economic benefits that purportedly accrued under Aquino seemed to them only to be felt by a few, leaving behind marginalized communities that included Filipino migrant workers. Through Duterte, many Filipinos in the diaspora felt that at long last, somebody was setting the nation on the correct path. Stories of Duterte’s reign as mayor of Davao were shared with reverence. That Duterte also made gestures toward catering to progressive causes, including his decision to offer cabinet-­level positions to progressive politicians (Bello 2017) and his condemnation of “anti–­Overseas Filipino Worker” (OFW) policies such as Philippine customs agents’ tendency to vigilantly search the luggage of returning overseas workers to search for taxable goods (Ranada 2016), seemed to show that despite his blustering persona, his politics were commendable. In addition, Duterte’s unwillingness to kowtow to U.S. imperialist policies appealed to progressive members of the diaspora (Bello 2017). Consequently, pro-­Duterte groups mushroomed across Canada, as they did in countries where there were numerous OFWs. The explicit goal was to get not just OFWs but also their families back home to support Duterte. Interestingly, within months of his election, some of the same members of the Filipino diaspora who supported him started to doubt his sincerity. There were hushed reports of extrajudicial killings, of children being the collateral damage in his “war against drugs,” of police forces acting without restraint. Then there was the jailing of political opponents, the eventual ousting of progressive cabinet members like former Department of Social Welfare and Development secretary Judy Taguiwalo, and the unceasing attacks against journalists. More recently, Duterte’s statements that he was “powerless to protect OFWs” and his belief that rape and sexual violence were unfortunate yet unavoidable realities that female OFWs had to face (Aguilar 2019) caused widespread anger among the Filipino OFWs whom I knew in Canada, including former supporters. Codex 15 Still, there were those in the diaspora who doubted the veracity of the reports. The discourse of “fake news” became prominent transnationally through Duterte’s and U.S. president Donald Trump’s use of the term. Both disavowed news reports that challenged their respective actions. This meant that there was widespread confusion about what was true and what was not. Hence many Filipinos abroad were unsure of who and what to believe. The way Duterte supporters quickly mobilized against anyone who dared voice concerns about Duterte, with vitriolic and oftentimes gendered threats made frequently, lent a chilling atmosphere to political discourse online. And yet even members of the Filipino diaspora who did not know what. © 2020, Studies in Global Asias. All Rights Reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098166924"

Those who engage in this form of propaganda hope to exploit the higher credibility of the hosting media site to enhance the persuasiveness of their message. Despite the obvious political implications and ethical issues at stake, political native advertising has received almost no scholarly attention. Our article begins to redress this imbalance. Using an online survey experiment with real political native advertisements in the Washington Post and The Telegraph bought by the Chinese government, we provide some of the first empirical evidence on basic but important features of political native advertising. We find, among other things, that respondents struggle to distinguish political advertisements from standard news stories regardless of their level of education and media literacy, that political advertisements are more convincing if they appear on and are perceived as news from an independent hosting media site than in a government-controlled news outlet, and that trust in the hosting media site declines if the political advertisement is detected. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090051800"

As fact-checking has become more prominent, it is therefore worth examining how respondents respond to fact-checks of politicians—a question with important implications for understanding the effects of this journalistic format on elections. We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents’ factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump.

However, its virtues and scope can be overstated. Here, we survey in detail the place of argumentation in science education. Our benchmark is the range of epistemic processes relevant to citizens and consumers as they assess the reliability of scientific claims in personal and public decision making. We consider multiple epistemic stages in the development (or ontogeny) of such claims: (a) observation and material investigation; (b) the crafting of concepts through individual cognition; (c) the checks and balances of the scientific community; (d) the challenges of credibility and expertise in a cultural context; and (e) the interpretation of “science in the wild,” where authentic scientific claims mingle with imitators and misinformation on the Internet and social media and in public discourse. We conclude that many conventional rationalist assumptions haunt current approaches to argumentation and limit its effectiveness, especially in the implicit goal of achieving intellectual independence for students as autonomous scientific agents. A more fruitful approach, from the perspective of functional scientific literacy, is a Whole Science perspective, which gives full expression to the spectrum of epistemic processes in science and science communication. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087904442"

The ability to easily and cheaply generate convincing images, audio, and video via artificial intelligence will have repercussions within politics, privacy, law, security, and broadly across all of society. In light of the widespread apprehension, numerous technological efforts aim to develop tools to distinguish between reliable audio/video and the fakes. These tools and strategies will be particularly effective for consumers when their guard is naturally up, for example during election cycles. However, recent research suggests that not only can deep fakes create credible representations of reality, but they can also be employed to create false memories. Memory malleability research has been around for some time, but it relied on doctored photographs or text to generate fraudulent recollections. These recollected but fake memories take advantage of our cognitive miserliness that favors selecting those recalled memories that evoke our preferred weltanschauung. Even responsible consumers can be duped when false but belief-consistent memories, implanted when we are least vigilant can, like a Trojan horse, be later elicited at crucial dates to confirm our pre-determined biases and influence us to accomplish nefarious goals. This paper seeks to understand the process of how such memories are created, and, based on that, proposing ethical and legal guidelines for the legitimate use of fake technologies. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082790553"

This paper aims to report the aggregated opinions of 42 brand management academics on the level of threat to, the involvement of, and the available actions of brand managers resulting from fake news. Design/methodology/approach: A Delphi study of 42 academics with peer-reviewed publications in the brand management domain. Findings: The study found that on some dimensions (e.g. the culpability of brand managers for incentivizing fake news by sponsoring its sources), expert opinion varied greatly. Other dimensions (e.g. whether the impact of fake news on brand management is increasing) reached a high level of consensus. The general findings indicate that fake news is an increasing phenomenon. Service brands are most at risk, but brand management generally is need of improving or implementing, fake news mitigation strategies. Research limitations/implications: Widely diverse opinions revealed the need for conclusive research on the questions of: whether brands suffer damage from sponsoring fake news, whether fake news production is supported by advertising and whether more extensive use of internet facilitated direct interactions with the public through crowdsourcing increased vulnerability. Practical implications: Experts agreed that practitioners must become more adept with contemporary tools such as fake news site blacklists, and much more aware of identifying and mitigating the brand vulnerabilities to fake news. Social implications: A noteworthy breadth of expert opinion was revealed as to whether embellished or fabricated brand narratives can be read as fake news, inviting the question as to whether brands now be held to higher standards of communication integrity. Originality/value: This paper provides a broad-shallow exploratory overview of the professional opinions of a large international panel of brand management academics on how the recent arrival of industrial fake news does, and will, impact this field. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072037132"

Several results of the Flash Eurobarometer survey conducted by the TNS Political and Social network in 2018 about fake news and disinformation online was used as research information. Average data of the 28 European Union countries corresponding to trust levels (e.g., totally trust, tend to trust, tend not to trust, do not trust at all and don't know) and perceived risks related to false news were exploited to build an adequate multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict citizens' beliefs regarding risk perception for their country. The relationship of socio-demographic variables (i.e., gender and age group) to the model was also examined. The results indicated that the predictive model has good psychometric properties but cannot be generalized for all population categories. The MLR model for forecasting of the EU citizens’ beliefs concerning the existence of risk perceptions of false news expansion in society fitted the data associated with various trust levels well in terms of Adjusted R2 =.405, p =.003. However, the beliefs of those who have total or partial confidence in various news cannot be explained by the model.

Participants encoded negative, neutral, and positive pictures depicting objects and scenes (i.e., target pictures), each accompanied with a descriptive verbal label (e.g., ""boy crying at funeral, "" ""wooden basket on floor, "" ""four chimpanzees laughing together""). Next, they encoded fragmented pictures of some of the scenes they did and did not earlier see (perceptual misinformation), or they received multiple presentations of the corresponding verbal labels (conceptual misinformation). Recollection of target pictures was then tested, using labels as retrieval cues. We had three key findings in each of two experiments. First, as in our prior work, both perceptual and conceptual misinformation significantly increased false recollection judgments of nonstudied pictures, including high-confidence errors. These effects implicate perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency mechanisms. Second, these misinformation effects generalized across all emotional categories, implicating separable roles of these two mechanisms on emotional recollections. Finally, conceptual misinformation was less likely to influence negative than neutral recollection errors, providing new evidence that emotion can improve retrieval monitoring accuracy and reduce false memories based on conceptual fluency (i.e., an emotional distinctiveness heuristic). © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063280820"

We examine how exposure to these messages affects individuals’ beliefs about how to deal with the virus and preventative behavior. In a survey of 864 survey respondents, we find a 0.26σ increase in knowledge about COVID-19 as measured by responses to factual questions. Through a list experiment embedded in the survey, we further find that potentially harmful behavior—not abiding by lockdown guidelines—decreased by 30 percentage points.

We are also interested in the question of whether publics report attempting to verify news that is suspect to them. Here we report on a comparative election survey in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. We find three key predictors of publics’ beliefs that they have been exposed to falsehoods: discussion of news, use of social media for political purposes, and exposure to counter-attitudinal information. The nexus between these three predictors and beliefs about falsehoods exists in all three countries, as we anticipate that it likely exists elsewhere. We do not find voters on the right to be different from those on the left in the United Kingdom and France, but do find a substantial difference in the United States, which is likely due to the 2016 Trump campaign.

In the current study, we measure prior knowledge prior to the experimental manipulation and thus provide a cleaner measurement of the causal effect of repetition on belief.

Yet, in addition to sharing political news, social media also allow users to make their own comments on news posts, comments which may challenge or distort the information contained in the articles. In this paper, we first analyze how social media posts on Twitter and Facebook differ from the actual content of their linked news articles, finding that social media comments regularly misrepresent the facts reported in the news. We then use a survey experiment to test the consequences of these information discrepancies. Specifically, we randomly assign individuals to read a full news article, a news article preview post (as seen on Facebook), or a news article preview with misinformative social commentary attached.

Individuals first evaluate the believability of a set of beliefs, after which, in Phase 1, some networks listen to a public speaker mentioning a subset of the previously evaluated beliefs while other networks complete a distracter task. In Phase 2, all participants engage in conversations within their network to discuss the initially evaluated beliefs. Believability is then measured both post conversation and after one week. We find that the public speaker impacts the community's beliefs by altering their mnemonic accessibility.

Namely, students need to learn about the epistemics of communicative practices, both within science (as a model) and in society. After profiling the current media landscape, we consider the implications of recent major studies on science communication for science education in the 21st century. We focus in particular on communicative patterns prominent in social media: algorithms to aggregate news, filter bubbles, echo chambers, spirals of silence, false-consensus effects, fake news, and intentional disinformation. We claim that media literacy is now essential to a complete view of the NOS, or “Whole Science.” We portray that new content as an extension of viewing science as a system of specialized experts, with mutual epistemic dependence, and the social and communicative practices that establish trust and credibility. © 2020 The Authors.

While research to date has focused on psychological and political antecedents to this phenomenon, few studies have explored the role of digital media literacy shortfalls. Using data from preregistered survey experiments conducted around recent elections in the United States and India, we assess the effectiveness of an intervention modeled closely on the world's largest media literacy campaign, which provided ""tips"" on how to spot false news to people in 14 countries. Our results indicate that exposure to this intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of both mainstream and false news headlines, but effects on the latter were significantly larger. As a result, the intervention improved discernment between mainstream and false news headlines among both a nationally representative sample in the United States (by 26.5%) and a highly educated online sample in India (by 17.5%). This increase in discernment remained measurable several weeks later in the United States (but not in India). However, we find no effects among a representative sample of respondents in a largely rural area of northern India, where rates of social media use are far lower. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Memory distortion due to misinformation has been linked to faulty reconstructive processes during memory retrieval and the reactivation of brain regions involved in the initial encoding of misleading details (cortical reinstatement). The current study investigated whether warning participants about the threat of misinformation can modulate cortical reinstatement during memory retrieval and reduce misinformation errors. Participants watched a silent video depicting a crime (original event) and were given an initial test of memory for the crime details. Then, participants listened to an auditory narrative describing the crime in which some original details were altered (misinformation). Importantly, participants who received a warning about the reliability of the auditory narrative either before or after exposure to misinformation demonstrated less susceptibility to misinformation on a final test of memory compared to unwarned participants. Warned and unwarned participants also demonstrated striking differences in neural activity during the final memory test. Compared to participants who did not receive a warning, participants who received a warning (regardless of its timing) demonstrated increased activity in visual regions associated with the original source of information as well as decreased activity in auditory regions associated with the misleading source of information. Stronger visual reactivation was associated with reduced susceptibility to misinformation, whereas stronger auditory reactivation was associated with increased susceptibility to misinformation. Together, these results suggest that a simple warning can modulate reconstructive processes during memory retrieval and reduce memory errors due to misinformation. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats—or of most available policy solutions.

Theoretically, the article is framed through one of the important roles of journalism in a democracy: that journalists make an enormous contribution to the public by shining the spotlight on those with power. In addition, journalists are meant to serve the public by being reliable conduits of information. Yet if newsrooms are depleted of staff, especially of senior journalists, how can these functions be fulfilled? The methods of research here include a survey and interviews with journalists and unionists. This shows the traumatic transitions from full-time jobs in newsrooms to freelance or “gig” work to public relations or just being “broke” and unemployed. It also shows how journalists could hardly fulfil their roles to deepen democracy given the precarity of their job situations. © 2020 iMasa.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092651920"

With the spread of social media, the Internet has become much more user-oriented. In contrast to traditional media, social media's lack of control mechanisms makes the accuracy of spreading news questionable. This brings us to the significance of fact-checking platforms. This study investigates the antecedents of spreading false news in Turkey. The purpose of the study is to determine the features of fake news. For this purpose, teyit.org, the biggest fact-checking platform in Turkey, has been chosen for analysis. The current study shows fake news to be detectable based on four features: Propagation, User Type, Social Media Type, and Formatting. According to the logistic regression analysis, the study's model obtained 86.7% accuracy. The study demonstrates that Facebook increases the likelihood of news being fake compared to Twitter or Instagram. Emoji usage is also statistically significant in terms of increasing the probability of fake news. Unexpectedly, the impact of photos or videos was found statistically insignificant. © 2021 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137313463"

The aim of the research is to analyse the capabilities of Dewey’s pragmatism in the philosophy of education as a medium for affirming today’s values of democracy. Methods. The article is based on a conceptually extended literature review. Such philosophical methods as hermeneutics (to take into account the socio-cultural context in the process of investigating the content of primary sources), interpretation (to study the basic theoretical foundations of the educational process and to explain their practical value) and comparative analysis (to identify similarities or differences between different ideas and conceptions) are applied. Results. The research identified the philosophical dimension of education, making it possible to understand the nature of learning in pragmatism. An investigation is pursued into what role the activity of the subject plays in the learning process, how the importance of freedom is substantiated in communication, and what place in the face of contemporary civilisational challenges has experience as a medium of true knowledge for becoming the ideals of a democratic society. Conclusion. The methodology of pragmatism makes it possible to resolve contradictions in education. The theoretical and practical principles of pragmatism that were substantiated by John Dewey contribute to the formation of an active life position of students, the free and constructive communication between all participants in learning, and the promotion of the ideals of a democratic society. They create an environment for the formation of genuine experience and the development of critical thinking skills as reliable means of protecting against misinformation or the spread of false values and the precondition for the advancement of humanistic values. © 2020, Pro Scientia Publica Foundation.

Using five national samples from the UK (n = 1050 and n = 1150), Ireland (n = 700), the USA (n = 700), Spain (n = 700) and Mexico (n = 700), we examine predictors of belief in the most common statements about the virus that contain misinformation. We also investigate the prevalence of belief in COVID-19 misinformation across different countries and the role of belief in such misinformation in predicting relevant health behaviours. We find that while public belief in misinformation about COVID-19 is not particularly common, a substantial proportion views this type of misinformation as highly reliable in each country surveyed. In addition, a small group of participants find common factual information about the virus highly unreliable. We also find that increased susceptibility to misinformation negatively affects people's self-reported compliance with public health guidance about COVID-19, as well as people's willingness to get vaccinated against the virus and to recommend the vaccine to vulnerable friends and family. Across all countries surveyed, we find that higher trust in scientists and having higher numeracy skills were associated with lower susceptibility to coronavirus-related misinformation. Taken together, these results demonstrate a clear link between susceptibility to misinformation and both vaccine hesitancy and a reduced likelihood to comply with health guidance measures, and suggest that interventions which aim to improve critical thinking and trust in science may be a promising avenue for future research.  © 2020 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095409007"

Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation.

Thus, 15 advocates who work against human trafficking in Chicago-based nonprofit organizations participated in semistructured interviews about their opinions and strategies. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. The present study identifies specific misperceptions of human trafficking in the media, highlights advocates’ opinions of this misinformation, and discusses advocates’ strategies to counteract inaccurate media, adding support to the role of media advocacy. Advocates note how media images shape and perpetuate stereotypes of trafficking through glamorizing sex work and sensationalizing stories that are most often international depictions of trafficking. Advocates report media generally shares only a piece of the story, simplifying the stories of survivors and the issue of human trafficking. Advocates critique media perpetuating these misperceptions for how they may contribute to policies and programs which fail to address structural factors that create vulnerabilities to be trafficked and the multisystem needs of survivors. However, advocates also note misperceptions can be counteracted by producing sensitive, informed media through social platforms. Advocates share their strategies counteracting misinformation through engaging in informative conversations, utilizing social media to educate, and promoting media messages of survivor agency.

Older adults are especially susceptible—they shared the most fake news during the 2016 U.S. election. The most intuitive explanation for this pattern lays the blame on cognitive deficits. Although older adults forget where they learned information, fluency remains intact, and knowledge accumulated across decades helps them evaluate claims. Thus, cognitive declines cannot fully explain older adults’ engagement with fake news. Late adulthood also involves social changes, including greater trust, difficulty detecting lies, and less emphasis on accuracy when communicating. In addition, older adults are relative newcomers to social media and may struggle to spot sponsored content or manipulated images. In a post-truth world, interventions should account for older adults’ shifting social goals and gaps in their digital literacy. © The Author(s) 2020.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084993956"

This approach is important in an era where 350 million new photos are added to Facebook every day, containing visual narratives, including those contained in manipulated images. Using quali-tative content analysis, this study investigated whether Facebook users' comments contain manifest statements of one's ability to critically read manipulated images. The results of this study found comments related to the photograph fell into six categories of discourse: (1) elitism, (2) humor, (3) unconditional support, (4) civil-ity and truth, (5) concern, and (6) miscellaneous rants. Evidence of the user ability to critically view the photograph and express their understanding of its falseness was found across all categories but especially in the humor, concern, civility and truth, and elitism categories. Regardless of the intent of the group responsible for posting the image on Facebook, we found evidence that the image was re- appropriated by both pro- and anti-Trump Facebook users as an evidentiary ex-hibit reinforcing their beliefs, though the beliefs the image serves to reinforce are vastly different between the two groups. © 2020, Sheree Josephson, James D.

The risk of this biological threat, its multiple unknown health aspects, social and economic impacts, and the inability of humanity to control it at present makes it difficult to predict how this situation will evolve. Unfortunately, such a global crisis gives rise to the manipulation of people by opportunistic groups through the falsification of information and news reporting. Loosely moderated social media platforms have largely contributed to an explosion of news referred to as ‘fake’. Global occurrences like the current COVID-19 pandemic reinforce the importance of developing critical thinking skills in undergraduate students as a fact-finding strategy to address the rising popularity of misinformation and disinformation found on social media sites. Consequently, this paper aims to highlight the importance of building a capacity to recognise fake news while seeking out reliable and valid information sources. Strategies to address fake news by international and local organisations will be explored using examples from Greece and Australia, as both of these countries demonstrated strong government leadership in the swift containment of the virus. Greece was quick to impose lockdowns that were respected and dutifully exercised by the Greek people. Similarly, Australia also imposed strict lockdowns strategies in the initial stages of their first reported COVID-19 cases and were also dutifully enacted by Australian citizens. Greece and Australia have been proactive in addressing disinformation and misinformation through comprehensive data analytics and fact-checking strategies, which are reported on through official platforms. Specifically, the authors aim to: a) Discuss the severe and even fatal problems that misinformation can cause, especially in the case of a global pandemic, like COVID-19, b) provide an audit and access to reliable sites, c) provide an outline of simple strategies that all individuals (including undergraduate students) can implement to source valid and reliable information surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. © Kaplan Singapore.

Obstacles abound within teaching and learning climate change, related to its complex nature, the proliferation of misinformation, and its absence from many science curricula. Efforts have previously been made to study teacher content knowledge and beliefs on climate change with varying results. This study employed identity as a theoretical framework to examine aspects of climate change teaching. This study followed a reflexively iterative process that enabled the construction of a conceptual model for identity development. This model demonstrates multifaceted influences including personal, professional, and political elements, and the dynamism these elements exhibit over time. This conceptual model is best described via five trends: Personal Valuation of Nature; Experiences in Science Teaching and Learning; Teacher Instructional Support and Agency; Epistemic Evidence-based Instruction; and Civic and Social Awareness via Socioscientific Literacy. The presence and strength of enactment of each trend led to the development of four possible constructions of identity: Passionate Environmentalist, Student Interest Engager, Content First Educator, and Civic and Epistemic Skills Promoter. Most frequently teachers exhibited combinations of identities and often created a unique amalgam of multiple dimensions of identities in action. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081751964"

We explored rural women's perceptions and beliefs regarding barriers to vasectomy use in the low resource setting of Pwani, Tanzania. The qualitative study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to obtain data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 20 married/cohabiting women with two or more children. Thematic analysis guided the data analysis, with qualitative data reporting informed by COREQ guidelines. Most participants were Muslim and had between two and six children. Most had completed primary-level education and were engaged in small-scale farming. We extracted three main themes with associated sub-themes:1) lack of education, which included men's education levels and inadequate knowledge and misinformation 2) religious beliefs, social pressure and stigma, which included community stigma and the belief that vasectomy was not good for men with multiple wives; and 3) promoting men's involvement in family planning which included educating men and the women's perceived role in promoting vasectomy. Participating women perceived vasectomy uptake to be affected by a lack of low knowledge (among men, women, and the community), misinformation, and various sociocultural barriers. Efforts to promote vasectomy and male involvement in reproductive health services should be directed to addressing deeply-rooted sociocultural barriers. Women may have an essential role in encouraging their partners' vasectomy uptake. In addition, engaging couples in family planning education is critical to enhance knowledge. Ideally, such community based education should be conducted in partnership with communities and healthcare providers. Copyright: © 2020 Pallangyo et al.

The Covid-19 crisis has led to an unprecedent reliance on digital solutions, ranging from teleworking to virus-tracking systems, resulting in the proliferation of Covid-19 related cybercrime, critical information infrastructure attacks and dissemination of pandemic disinformation. Although the virus has been repeatedly portrayed as life altering and as having considerably increased the cybersecurity risks faced by States, businesses and citizens, the proposed solutions, however, have accelerated existing trends in the field rather than resulting in significant institutional change. In particular, there has been a reinforcement of the role as a coordinating actor, of the introduction of further coherence between sub-areas and instruments, and of the positioning of public-private partnerships at the heart of the policy. However, where the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation is concerned, a changing trust relationship has resulted in a discursive shift in which these platforms require greater oversight, a belief reinforced by the spread of Covid-19 disinformation. The article proposes, through the lenses of historical and discursive institutionalism, that the EU’s response to Covid-19 in the field of cybersecurity can only be understood in light of these pre-existing trends, which are the result of an economic and security path dependence that emerged in the 1980s. © 2020 The Author(s).

As they fervently support the agenda of lifelong learning, libraries recognise that there are various influences that redefine the process of student learning. Admittedly, librarians need to be more creative in motivating post-millennial students to help them fully develop their Media and Information Literacy (MIL) skills. This paper explores how games are adopted and utilised by academic libraries as an interactive approach to entice students to learn essential MIL competencies. It shows how games can be a viable tool not only to deliver information literacy (IL) instruction in a collaborative learning environment but to also effectively engage and attract students to use the library resources and services. While the use of games is not novel, the way it is delivered and re-purposed to meet MIL competencies is vital for today’s young generation of learners. This report demonstrates how two academic libraries in the Philippines and Kazakhstan were able to embed MIL skills through a library race challenge. Furthermore, this paper discusses the practical steps undertaken in the preparation of the game as well as the observations made during and after the activity was conducted. From this, other libraries may gain insights and best practices on how to leverage this method to further champion MIL in their own communities. © 2020, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

This research analyses the use of and trust in information sources through a nationwide survey of 30 editors-in-chief of Spain’s most relevant newspapers, radio, television and online media outlets (N=30). With a very high response rate (76.66%), the findings confirm that the use of unofficial sources (victims and those affected) are prioritized over official government sources. It is significant that the inferential analysis reveals that the editors give the same credibility as a source of information to the government as it does to the victims in the current context of misinformation, fake news and hoaxes. It is concluded that newsmaking should be built on the balanced use of official and unofficial sources.

Based on an exploration of the current literature, the authors discuss negative aspects of using social media for information purposes, namely, in terms of the dubious credibility of social media content, the commonality of echo chambers, and the effect of emotional content on users. There are several benefits of social media within our society, but ultimately social media should be approached with caution when it is used as a source of information for news, health-related information, or scholarly topics. Although this paper critiques social media primarily in terms of its implications for the library and information science field, it also views these various issues associated with social media more broadly in terms of their implications for the general public in shaping contemporary American culture, society, and politics. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite mounting attention to the problem of online misinformation and growing agreement that digital literacy efforts are important, prior research offers few concrete ideas about what skilled evaluations look like. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Our purpose in this study was to seek out those who are skilled in online evaluations in order to understand how their strategies and approaches to evaluating digital content might inform educational efforts. We sampled 45 experienced users of the Internet: 10 Ph.D. historians, 10 professional fact checkers, and 25 Stanford University undergraduates. Analysis focused on the strategies participants used to evaluate online information and arrive at judgments of credibility. Research Design: In this expert/novice study, participants thought aloud as they evaluated live websites and searched for information on social and political issues such as bullying, minimum wage, and teacher tenure. We analyze and present findings from three of the tasks participants completed. Findings/Results: Historians and students often fell victim to easily manipulated features of websites, such as official-looking logos and domain names. They read vertically, staying within a website to evaluate its reliability. In contrast, fact checkers read laterally, leaving a site after a quick scan and opening up new browser tabs in order to judge the credibility of the original site. Compared to the other groups, fact checkers arrived at more warranted conclusions in a fraction of the time. Conclusions/Recommendations: We draw on insights gleaned from the fact checkers' practices to examine current curricular approaches to teaching web credibility as well as to suggest alternatives.

From Welsh sheep using rounda-bouts to dolphins swimming in the Venice canals, the real from the fake becomes difficult to discern through technological advances but also in the belief in the underlying ideological environmental message it enables. In this article, I examine how these viral videos are not only being faked for the social validation of likes and retweets but have also become a tool for ecofascism: a far-right ideology that marries environmentalism with white supremacist ethnonationalism. I examine how social media is used to implicitly spread ecofascist ideas through an environmentalism fakery such as the urban Venetian dolphin that shows how humans, not COVID-19, are the virus and how these human-less vignettes are ultimately used by ecofascists to argue against immigration in order to ‘bring nature back to the natural order of things’.

Despite economic downturn, one major impact of global pandemic is the rise of ‘infodemic’ and ‘disinfodemic’, which actually creates challenge for the public to access reliable information when they require it. News media plays a crucial role in such stressful situations by providing timely and accurate information about the pandemic. Nevertheless, when the news verification and gatekeeping is weak, dissemination of false information within the infodemic can result in the toxic disinfodemic of disinformation and misinformation. It is imperative to recognize that journalists, especially in restrained environments (like Pakistan), can combat infodemic and disinfodemic about the pandemic when their safety and accessibility to needed information are guaranteed, and when they are not prone to diverse challenges. Therefore, drawing on Reese’s hierarchy of influences model, this study seeks to explore the various levels of influences that impact on the Pakistani journalists’ reporting and their ability to deal with the challenges of infodemic and disinfodemic amid COVID-19 pandemic.

Unexpectedly, for one of three detection measures, untruthful participants detected more manipulations than did truthful participants. Guilt did not moderate detection rates.

Citizens are influenced by public figures, and some tend to believe that this is a myth. They are then far less inclined to adopt eco-friendly behaviors, consequently increasing their carbon footprint. The alarming issue of global warming is becoming irreparable with increase commute by car (Steg 2003). For the individuals to adopt “good” behaviors, it is not appropriate only to debilitate their beliefs but also to help them change their habits by a little help; that said, by a nudge. Previous research has shown the effectiveness of nudges on behaviors (Thaler and Sunstein 2008), this research proposes to use digital nudge as there is a growth in the relevance of nudging in the digital sphere as individuals are taking decisions on the influence of mobile applications or websites (Mirsch et al. 2017). This research examines two choice architectures. First, the feedback nudge – to put the targets in a favorable context so that they incline towards the right decision; it will also assist in knowing the adoption of public transport and more generally modes of public transport. Second, the planning prompts nudge to push them to act (i.e., go beyond the intention of change). The presentation of the social proof in the form of the story without contradicting the worldview of the recipient, the fake news could be debunked. These messages will be broadcasted on a mobile application, allowing personalized content delivered at a convenient time chosen. Other features of the messages like the social norm, will also be studied. A qualitative study and then experiments will make it possible to highlight the effects of a variety of characteristics of digital nudges on the debunking of beliefs, the intention of behavior, and actual behavior. The mediating role of processing fluency will be shown as well as the moderating role of online social support and credibility of the source. We point out three main contributions. First, this research addresses the question of the mechanism of a digital nudge. Second, we signify the combination of social influence and feedback nudge choice architecture for behavior change and debunking. The presentation of the social proof in the form of the story without contradicting the worldview of the recipient, the fake news can be debunked. Third, through this study, we propose that planning prompts nudge can be utilized in closing the intention-behavior gap in the context of mobility-related research. Finally, the disadvantages of Travel feedback programs (TFP’s) that had developed in Japan to increase the use of public transportation (Fujii et al. 2009) have been addressed as TFP’s are expensive to apply, with no theoretical and methodological framework. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125194244"

There was plenty of misinformation that runs alongside may have harmful effects on individuals' well-being. More importantly, the middle-aged and elderly people might serve as unintentional accomplices in spreading misinformation. To deal with these issues, more understandings should be garnered about the nature of both middle-aged and elderly users’ information sharing behavior via social media. This study examined users’ motivations through a survey questionnaire, and a total of 268 valid responses were obtained. The findings showed that the users’ motivations were various and rooted from three major factors: 1) Social Interaction; 2) Knowledge Sharing; 3) Information Exchange. Although users have certain abilities to judge the authenticity of online information, users with lower educational levels were more likely to share information due to the need for social interaction and the authenticity might not be the main concern for them. This study suggests that to curb the spread of misinformation around the social communities of aged people, verification channels from authorities are vital but rather insufficient at times.

Considering this knowledge to be key in Communication Education, and having confirmed its close relationship with the dimensions of media competence, its presence is analyzed in the Media and Information Literacy (MIL) curriculum for teachers, whose training is crucial for the success of the process, developed by UNESCO, an organization that is a global referent in the field. A semantic content analysis reveals, from a quantitative perspective, a strong presence of thematic areas covered by the Structural Considerations of Information subject within the competencies and contents of the curriculum. However, at a qualitative level, there are fundamental weaknesses in its relationship with the structural approach to information. This occurs when the critical spirit of the text declines, starting with a definition of the media as sources of reliable information. The ubiquity of disinformation, and the key role played by stakeholders' knowledge, as well as the development of critical thinking to address it requires an update of this curriculum-the present review contributes to this development-highlighting the current necessity to address it from a structural vantage that fosters critical citizenship and a democratic process. © 2019 Grupo Comunicar Ediciones.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077249508"

Techniques that train fake news classifiers exist, but they all assume an abundance of resources including large labeled datasets and expert-curated corpora, which low-resource languages may not have. In this work, we make two main contributions: First, we alleviate resource scarcity by constructing the first expertly-curated benchmark dataset for fake news detection in Filipino, which we call “Fake News Filipino.” Second, we benchmark Transfer Learning (TL) techniques and show that they can be used to train robust fake news classifiers from little data, achieving 91% accuracy on our fake news dataset, reducing the error by 14% compared to established few-shot baselines. Furthermore, lifting ideas from multitask learning, we show that augmenting transformer-based transfer techniques with auxiliary language modeling losses improves their performance by adapting to writing style. Using this, we improve TL performance by 4-6%, achieving an accuracy of 96% on our best model. Lastly, we show that our method generalizes well to different types of news articles, including political news, entertainment news, and opinion articles. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096600507"

While such approaches see the problem of misinformation in terms of a contest between truth and falsehood, history suggests that people believe falsehoods, because they need to for a variety of psychological or socio-cultural reasons. While understanding what “needs” falsehoods meet may not provide an immediate solution to the problem of misinformation, it does open a different perspective on the question. In the end, the essay suggests that the current trend towards STEM education, to the growing exclusion of the humanities, may be slowly undermining the very analytical skills the public needs to be able to counter the tides of misinformation. © 2020, Harvard Kennedy School.

Additionally, they highlight the non-legal initiatives the Singapore government has taken to counter disinformation and safeguard social cohesion, via programmes such as the National Framework on Information, Media and Cyber Literacy and S.U.R.E.

Since cognitive capacity is required for efficient correction of one’s judgment after learning that the basis of the judgement is no longer valid, we expected that high levels of media multitasking would decrease one’s ability to adequately update one’s beliefs. We ran two studies in which participants were asked to form an impression of a target person based on their profile on a professional networking site. The profile contained either neutral information (control condition) or a negative comment which was later disproven (false-information conditions). We additionally manipulated media multitasking demands (in Study 1) or measured participants’ frequency of media multitasking (Study 2) and tested whether the level of media multitasking is related to the degree to which the initial attitudes were adjusted after learning that the negative comment was false. We found a significant but rather small effect of the manipulation in Study 1 indicating that participants in both multitasking conditions had more negative attitudes after the correction compared to the baseline, but not to the mono-tasking condition. Crucially, media multitasking demands did not impact attitude adjustment. The results of Study 2 showed that the relationship between media-multitasking frequency measured with a scale and attitude adjustment was non-significant. Overall, the findings provide no evidence that media multitasking–whether experimentally manipulated or chronic–plays a role in correction after misinformation.

The contradictory views of the pro- and anti-GMO camps expressed in media debates, as well as deliberate anti-GM actions driven by nongovernmental organizations, have contributed to general misinformation and confusion as regards GM foods. Taken altogether this has resulted in political decisions taken on the regulations concerning GM foods, which vary significantly in different geographical regions. A number of factors can shape consumer’s attitudes toward GM foods, including level of understanding of science, religious and ethical beliefs, cultural aspects as well as openness to novelty. Therefore, consumer’s attitudes toward GM foods, their safety and potential risks may significantly diverge across different human populations. In this chapter, a comprehensive review of the public perception of GM foods in the last two decades in various European, North and South American and Asian countries is presented. The factors that potentially influence the observed differences in consumer’s attitudes are also discussed. As highlighted, there is an urgent need to implement evidence-based educational programs or continue to support the existing ones to raise public awareness of the current possibilities and limitations of GM foods. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, in this setup the data calibration issue is often not discussed and, rather, implicitly assumed, while the clinical monitors might not be designed for the data analysis purpose. We hypothesize that this calibration issue for a secondary analysis may become an important source of artifacts in patient monitor data. We test an off-the-shelf integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device for its ability to yield a reliable pulse transit time (PTT) signal. Approach This is a retrospective clinical study using two databases: one containing 35 subjects who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, another containing 22 subjects who underwent spontaneous breathing test in the intensive care unit. All data sets include recordings of PPG and ECG using a commonly deployed patient monitor. We calculated the PTT signal offline. Main results We report a novel constant oscillatory pattern in the PTT signal and identify this pattern as a sawtooth artifact. We apply an approach based on the de-shape method to visualize, quantify and validate this sawtooth artifact. Significance The PPG and ECG signals not designed for the PTT evaluation may contain unwanted artifacts. The PTT signal should be calibrated before analysis to avoid erroneous interpretation of its physiological meaning. © 2019 Lin et al.

We instead propose that discussions of human psychology may benefit from viewing ourselves not so much as rational animals but rather as the rationalizing animal. The current article provides evidence that rationalization is unique to humans and argues that rationalization processes (e.g., cognitive dissonance reduction, post hoc justification of choices, confabulation of reasons for moral positions) are aimed at creating the fictions we prefer to believe and maintaining the impression that we are psychologically coherent and rational. Coherence appears to be prioritized at the expense of veridicality, suggesting that distorted perceptions and appraisals can be adaptive for humans—under certain circumstances, we are better off understanding ourselves and reality not so accurately. Rationalization also underlies the various shared beliefs, religions, norms, and ideologies that have enabled humans to organize and coordinate their actions on a grand scale, for better or worse. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this unique human psychological trait.

Recent literature has indicated that it can be a serious threat to brands and their management. Brands can be both victims of, and either unwitting or deliberate agents of fake news. This paper presents the results of a three-round Delphi study of a panel of brand marketing scholars in which they indicated their familiarity with ten major high-tech brands, and estimated the vulnerability of these to fake news, and how effectively these brands would deal with fake news. The levels of familiarity with the brands vary considerably, and it also appears that lower familiarity with the brand (with one notable exception) is associated with higher estimates of vulnerability, and lower estimates of the management’s ability to deal effectively with fake news. The researchers considered a large number of commercial media brand ratings with titles such as, “World’s Best Hi-tech Brands”, “100 Most Valuable Brands”, “25 Best Technology Brands” and the like. Not surprisingly all these lists are marked by their differences rather than their similarities. A handful of brands such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft feature in all these rankings, but behind them, there tend to be differences. For purposes of this study, the researchers then settled on and included the following ten high-tech brands: Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Intel, eBay, Facebook and Dell. The fake news phenomenon is unlikely to dissipate in the future, especially as social media technologies continue to make its spread so much easier. The risk to brands will be ever-present and will almost certainly increase. Hi-tech brand custodians do and will need to be vigilant of how they might be vulnerable and to have contingency plans in place for that day in the future when their brand becomes a target. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125247444"

The aim of the article is to show the status of April Fools’ Day jokes in the Polish and English language context on the example of the material published on a single topic — swallowing inedible objects. In order to develop the methodology of analysis of humour in the news, it is useful to take into account the notion of incongruity, whether it is appropriate incongruity, background and foreground incongruities or various levels of meta-scripts. In order to discuss the collected material, it seems necessary to specify what kind of incongruities are involved as well as analyse the style of the stories in order to identify the intended message. The irrational behaviour of the stories’ protagonists seems to point the readers in the direction of a comic reading, but the stories are accompanied by pictures and even videos which aim at proving their credibility. The analysis of the selected examples points to the presence of incongruities, which are enhanced by colloquialisms as well as quasi-punch lines. Some news published on the first day of April look like jokes, but do not end with the traditional April Fool punch line, while some others are similarly strange, although they are published on different occasions. Thus it is not easy to differentiate serious from non-serious news. The appearance of daily news with incongruous content could also be seen in a broader context as one of the elements of the trend towards “weirdization” of public discourse. © 2020 Saint Petersburg State University","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104073866"

A crucial strategy of this climate change counter-movement (CCCM) was the implementation of well-organized efforts to undermine public understanding of human-caused climate change by promoting uncertainty over mainstream climate science. These long-term efforts, often led by front groups to hide corporate responsibility, enlisted contrarian scientists for credibility and public relations firms for expertise in messaging. The misinformation developed by the CCCM has been greatly amplified by conservative media (especially Fox News, WSJ and talk radio), bloggers, and social media - as well as the Republican Party in the US, which has institutionalized climate change denial.

For example, studies show that most people, unfortunately, do not distinguish between fake news and other types of news. However, the problem of fake news is not only related to fabricated media texts, but also reflects the audience's general dissatisfaction with traditional mass media, some influential politicians, parties and organizations. From the audience's point of view, the problem of fake news is not limited to false news - it also concerns low-quality journalism, political propaganda and misleading forms of advertising, (dis)trust in public institutions and media agencies. The fact, that in the modern media world unambiguously true and explicitly false information is becoming increasingly rare, further complicates the situation. As a rule, rather sophisticated manipulation techniques that mix reliable and fake information are being used, so there can be no simple judgements regarding the development of mechanisms to ban or remove false media information. Countering disinformation can be based both on technological (computer) algorithms and on qualitative analytics. We also believe that mass media education of the audience can effectively contribute to the development of analytical thinking and media competence of an individual. In particular, the synthesized typology of mass-media manipulation techniques (based on an analysis of scientific research) by the authors of the article can contribute to the development of media competence. © 2020 Academic Publishing House Researcher.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091926794"

Participants (N = 3,140) viewed six news stories concerning campaign events—two fabricated and four authentic. Almost half of the sample reported a false memory for at least one fabricated event, with more than one third of participants reporting a specific memory of the event. “Yes” voters (those in favor of legalizing abortion) were more likely than “no” voters to “remember” a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote “no,” and “no” voters were more likely than “yes” voters to “remember” a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote “yes.” This difference was particularly strong for voters of low cognitive ability. A subsequent warning about possible misinformation slightly reduced rates of false memories but did not eliminate these effects. This study suggests that voters in a real-world political campaign are most susceptible to forming false memories for fake news that aligns with their beliefs, in particular if they have low cognitive ability. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071549369"

Most significantly, concerns grew that Beijing was attempting to sway the island’s politics armed with a new “Russian-style influence campaign” weapon (Horton, 2018). To investigate the speculated effects of the “onslaught of misinformation,” an online survey with 1068 randomly selected voters was conducted immediately after the election. Findings confirmed that false news affected Taiwanese voters’ judgment of the news and their voting decisions. More than 50% of the voters cast their votes without knowing the correct campaign news. In particular, politically neutral voters, who were the least able to discern fake news, tended to vote for the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) candidates. Demographic analysis further revealed that female voters tended to be more likely to believe fake news during the election period compared to male voters. Younger or lower-income voters had the lowest levels of discernment of fake news. Further analyses and the implications of these findings for international societies are deliberated in the conclusion. © 2020, Center for Asian Public Opinion Research and Collaboration Initiative.

However, in many societies there is substantial evidence of biased cognition and polarisation about climate change. Further, many appear unable to distinguish reliable scientific information from false claims or misinformation. While deliberation significantly reduces polarisation about climate change, and can even increase the provision of reliable beliefs, these benefits are difficult to scale up, and are slow to affect whole societies. In response, I propose a combined strategy of 'thinking and nudging'. While deliberative theorists tend to view nudging askance, combining deliberation with nudges promises to be a timelier and more effective response to climate change than deliberation alone. I outline several proposals to improve societal deliberative capacity while reducing climate risks, including media reform, strategic communication and framing of debates, incentivising pro-climate behaviour change, and better education about science. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073017344"

Two experimental studies tested whether this easiness effect can be prevented if readers can lean on evaluations of source credibility instead. In both studies, medical nonexperts read Internet texts about different health topics and evaluated the contained claims. The texts were either more comprehensible or less comprehensible, and they were supposedly authored by either a more credible or a less credible source. Experiment 1 demonstrated that nonexperts (i.e., 48 undergraduate students) agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from a more credible compared to a less credible source. However, the influence of source credibility did not prevent the easiness effect: Participants also agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from more comprehensible texts compared to less comprehensible texts. The same pattern of results emerged in Experiment 2 (with 53 undergraduate students), where source credibility was manipulated more strongly. Although source credibility had a greater effect on nonexperts’ claim judgment than in Experiment 1, readers still agreed more strongly and confidently with claims from more comprehensible than less comprehensible texts.

A wealth of literature has shown it to be an effective strategy for preventing the assimilation of beliefs and attitudes in several domains, including healthcare, politics, and advertising. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, its utility as a means ofpreventing the adoption of beliefs and attitudes consistent with strategic messaging distributed by malicious actors has yet to be sufficiently evaluated. This chapter introduces attitudinal inoculation as a viable strategy for challenging online disinformation produced by violent extremist groups. Methods - Through a systematic review of the literature on attitudinal inoculation and disinformation, this chapter represents an attempt to link broad themes of narrative persuasion with the field of counter-terrorism. Findings - This chapter will offer specific guidance on the development of inoculation messages intended to mitigate the persuasive efficacy of online disinformation produced and distributed by violent extremist organizations. Originality/Value - As one of the first attempts to demonstrate the utility of attitudinal inoculation in the field of terrorism and radicalization studies, this chapter presents a novel approach to understanding contemporary issues of political extremism. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135187767"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we attended to a viral spread of incorrect and misleading information that compromised collective actions and public health measures to contain the spread of the disease. We investigated the influence of fear of COVID-19 on social and cognitive factors including believing in fake news, bullshit receptivity, overclaiming, and problem-solving - within two of the populations that have been severely hit by COVID-19: Italy and the United States of America. To gain a better understanding of the role of misinformation during the early height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also investigated whether problem-solving ability and socio-cognitive polarization were associated with believing in fake news. Results showed that fear of COVID-19 is related to seeking out information about the virus and avoiding infection in the Italian and American samples, as well as a willingness to share real news (COVID and non-COVID-related) headlines in the American sample. However, fear positively correlated with bullshit receptivity, suggesting that the pandemic might have contributed to creating a situation where people were pushed toward pseudo-profound existential beliefs. Furthermore, problem-solving ability was associated with correctly discerning real or fake news, whereas socio-cognitive polarization was the strongest predictor of believing in fake news in both samples. From these results, we concluded that a construct reflecting cognitive rigidity, neglecting alternative information, and black-and-white thinking negatively predicts the ability to discern fake from real news. Such a construct extends also to reasoning processes based on thinking outside the box and considering alternative information such as problem-solving.  © Salvi, Iannello, Cancer, McClay, Rago, Dunsmoor and Antonietti.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102933561"

As such, while uncertainty might be communicated in news articles about climate science, climate skeptics have also exploited this uncertainty to cast doubt on science itself. We performed two studies to assess whether scientific uncertainty affects laypeople’s assessments of issue uncertainty, the credibility of the information, their trust in scientists and climate science, and impacts their decision-making. In addition, we addressed how these effects are influenced by further information on relevant scientific processes, because knowing that uncertainty goes along with scientific research could ease laypeople’s interpretations of uncertainty around evidence and may even protect against negative impacts of such uncertainty on trust. Unexpectedly, in study 1, after participants read both a text about research methods and a news article that included scientific uncertainty, they had lower trust in the scientists’ assertions than when they read the uncertain news article alone (but this did not impact trust in climate science or decision-making). In study 2, we tested whether these results occurred due to participants overestimating the scientific uncertainty at hand. Hence, we varied the framing of uncertainty in the text on scientific processes. We found that exaggerating the scientific uncertainty produced by scientific processes (vs. framing the uncertainty as something to be expected) did not negatively affect participants’ trust ratings. However, the degree to which participants preferred effortful reasoning on problems (intellective epistemic style) correlated with ratings of trust in scientists and climate science and with their decision-making. In sum, there was only little evidence that the introduction of uncertainty in news articles would affect participants’ ratings of trust and their decision-making, but their preferred style of reasoning did. © 2020 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088995582"

One of the most innovative actors in this process has been the Russian state, whose disinformation campaigns have influenced elections and shaped political discourse globally. A key element of these campaigns is the content produced by state-funded outlets like RT and Sputnik, whose articles are republished by under funded or sympathetic local media, as well as coordinated groups that attempt to shape mainstream political narratives. Using a tailored text-as-data approach, we examine the thematic and linguistic differences in articles produced by U.S. and Russian state-funded and mainstream outlets in Serbia. We use 11 features (frames and in-text characteristics) to construct an article country-source classifier with a high degree of accuracy.

The inoculation metaphor relies on a medical analogy: by pre-emptively exposing people to weakened doses of misinformation cognitive immunity can be conferred. A recent example is the Bad News game, an online fake news game in which players learn about six common misinformation techniques. We present a replication and extension into the effectiveness of Bad News as an anti-misinformation intervention. We address three shortcomings identified in the original study: the lack of a control group, the relatively low number of test items, and the absence of attitudinal certainty measurements. Using a 2 (treatment vs. control) × 2 (pre vs. post) mixed design (N = 196) we measure participants' ability to spot misinformation techniques in 18 fake headlines before and after playing Bad News. We find that playing Bad News significantly improves people's ability to spot misinformation techniques compared to a gamified control group, and crucially, also increases people's level of confidence in their own judgments. Importantly, this confidence boost only occurred for those who updated their reliability assessments in the correct direction. This study offers further evidence for the effectiveness of psychological inoculation against not only specific instances of fake news, but the very strategies used in its production. Implications are discussed for inoculation theory and cognitive science research on fake news.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109349193"

They are targets in a divisive culture war waged by ideological organisations that disseminate misleading and false information about social and political matters on line, on screen and in print. The purpose of this paper is to alert information professionals to this issue and suggests that, although they should not engage in this war, they must be prepared to use their professional expertise to identify and correct unreliable material. Further, they should cooperate with other true information organisations to expose the fallacious sources that endanger democracy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analysed material from academic texts and papers, professional journals, serious contemporary journalism, political manifestoes, Internet blogs and items from the BBC sound archive to illustrate the history, size and nature of the problem and to suggest how it might be dealt with. This documentary analysis was based on the belief that information professionals are not the only people examining and concerned about this issue. It therefore included material from a wide range of other disciplines, including psychology, medicine and politics. Findings: There is evidence that populist movements from the political right dislike information organisations and have historically, through misinformation and misrepresentation, persuaded working class citizens that they are being exploited by an elite. Public libraries and the BBC are highly trusted organisations, but much of the British public goes to sources it trusts least, such as tabloid newspapers, for information on politics and society. Librarians and BBC broadcasters demonstrated their value during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they need to engage with other professional groups to fully understand what is happening and counteract the threats it presents to our democracy. Originality/value: The paper deals with a significant current issue that needs to be considered urgently by practitioners, academics and policy makers. It includes practical examples and suggestions demonstrating how information workers have and can help their users identify and use trusted and accurate information sources and perhaps be made aware of editorial bias. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099701222"

In particular, it is unknown how the interaction between the content of blog posts and blog comments affects readers’ attitudes. We report an experiment that orthogonally varied those two variables using blog posts and comments that either did, or did not, support the scientific consensus on climate change. We find that beliefs are partially shaped by readers’ perception of how widely an opinion expressed in a blog post appears to be shared by other readers. The perceived social consensus among readers, in turn, is determined by whether blog comments endorse or reject the contents of a post. When comments reject the content, perceived reader consensus is lower than when comments endorse the content.

At the beginning of the new decade, populism in the US is associated with support for the Republican party and Donald Trump in particular, and that is how I address it here. Using secondary data from a number of related studies, we find that, overall, support for Trump is not only negatively related to political knowledge, but also to other factors that make his supporters unaware of their being misinformed. This is because, more than for others, partisan cues serve them as a basis for their factual beliefs about political actors and events and assessments of the beliefs of others. While political knowledge has long been comparatively low in the US, as I show in the early part of the article, the relationship between misinformation and populism (i.e., support for Trump) is seen as a new and especially worrisome element.

Based on the external incentives model, Russia, China and Turkey are thus analysed as competing external actors to the EU’s enlargement policy in the WB. We establish that during the Covid-19 crisis these actors have been increasingly competing with the EU especially with respect to the determinacy of conditions via state propaganda and by attacking the EU’s credibility with disinformation campaigns. Nevertheless, their influence in terms of the size of the rewards and domestic adoption costs has dropped in comparison to the EU as the latter has increased its rewards, strength-ened conditionality and regained some of its lost credibility capabilities. The most significant change visible during the Covid-19 crisis is a further fragmentation in addressing individual WB states by Russia, China and Turkey, whereas the EU remains the only external actor capable and willing to addresses the entire WB region. © 2020, Ljubljana University.

Actions of this kind do not correspond with the classic division of soft and hard power, since neither can their goals nor the means they utilise be unambiguously defined as coercion, payment, or attraction (Nye, 2009; Mazur. Bubak, 2020). In my article, I describe the hidden means of propaganda employed by the Russian Federation that are additionally supported by a process of armament which cannot be classified as an act of disinformation. These actions aim at achieving a specific type of psychological vantage which stems from an atmosphere of fear, lack of trust, and enmity created within European societies as a result of the incoming information about Russia's increasing military potential as well as new, dangerous means and resources that could be utilised in combat. Such an atmosphere is referred to as a ""war in the head"", and it pertains to the personal belief that a military conflict is imminent, expressed by individual citizens including those in key public offices. This phenomenon, while bringing to mind Hobbes' state of nature which encompasses the distinct readiness to fight, directly afflicts the internal and international security of European states. Such a situation directly afflicts the internal and international security of European states, for the state of fear and distrust leads to the dismantlement of public democratic institutions, and it does not help in the search for effective methods of solving either internal or global problems (Nussbaum, 2018). © 2020 by the Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148889917"

Past research indicates that not only do young adults rely heavily on information obtained from the web and social networks, but also that they may not be able to judge the authenticity, validity, and reliability of digital information, and may share misinformation among themselves. This can be particularly problematic in the context of health information. Two complementary research studies investigated young adults’ information needs and information seeking in support of their personal well-being, and in comparison to academic and other everyday-life information domains. Results show that young adults consider a range of factors as part of their well-being; these include physical and mental health, spirituality, social connections, and financial stability. They engage in information seeking (active and passive) in support of all of these factors. While they were able to identify information resources as more or less credible, they did not necessarily choose highly credible resources most frequently. Interestingly, they did not use social media sources frequently in the context of health information, choosing to deliberately maintain a degree of privacy with respect to health. While there is evidence of some information literacy skills, there remains a need for further and more extensive information literacy education.

Multivariate analysis of our original survey data confirms that young people are prone to overestimating how many seats are held by women, and this pattern is especially sharp among male respondents. In addition, a memory of being represented by a woman in the past tends to inflate overestimates further. Erroneous thinking among the young may produce an ""ignorance is bliss""effect by reducing the apparent need to elect more women to office and raising levels of trust in government. In contrast, more realistic beliefs among older people make the dominance of men in public office more apparent and actionable. © 2020 The Author(s).

The speed of news diffusion is striking. Given the popularity of social networks, more and more users began posting pictures, information, and news about personal life. At the same time, they started to use all this information to get informed about what their friends do or what is happening in the world, many of them arousing much suspicion. The problem we are currently experiencing is that we do not currently have an automatic method of figuring out in real-time which news or which users are credible and which are not, what is false or what is true on the Internet. The goal of this is to analyze Twitter in real-time using neural networks in order to provide us key elements about both the credibility of tweets and users who posted them. Thus, we make a real-time heatmap using information gathered from users to create overall images of the areas from which this fake news comes. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096591174"

This study tested the effect of two simple interventions, both of which primed critical thinking, on individuals’ evaluation of the credibility of real and fake news about climate change on Facebook. Through an online experiment (n = 2,750 participants), participants either read a series of guidelines for evaluating news online, or read and then rated the importance of each guideline; a control group was not exposed to guidelines of any type. We found that participants exposed to both types of guidelines reported a reduced likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news about climate change on Facebook. Importantly, exposure to these guidelines did not diminish individuals’ likelihood to trust, like, or share legitimate climate news. The effect sizes for both types of intervention were small.

We assessed content from the most active vaccine accounts on Twitter to understand how existing online communities contributed to the ‘infodemic’ during the early stages of the pandemic. While we expected vaccine opponents to share misleading information about COVID-19, we also found vaccine proponents were not immune to spreading less reliable claims. In both groups, the single largest topic of discussion consisted of narratives comparing COVID-19 to other diseases like seasonal influenza, often downplaying the severity of the novel coronavirus.

Consequently, psychological research to date has focused on determining whether there are traits that account for belief in conspiracy theories (BCT) within a deficit model. Alternatively, a two-component, socio-epistemic model of BCT is proposed that seeks to account for the ubiquity of conspiracy theories, their variance along a continuum, and the inconsistency of research findings likening them to psychopathology. Within this model, epistemic mistrust is the core component underlying conspiracist ideation that manifests as the rejection of authoritative information, focuses the specificity of conspiracy theory beliefs, and can sometimes be understood as a sociocultural response to breaches of trust, inequities of power, and existing racial prejudices. Once voices of authority are negated due to mistrust, the resulting epistemic vacuum can send individuals “down the rabbit hole” looking for answers where they are vulnerable to the biased processing of information and misinformation within an increasingly “post-truth” world. The two-component, socio-epistemic model of BCT argues for mitigation strategies that address both mistrust and misinformation processing, with interventions for individuals, institutions of authority, and society as a whole. © 2020, PsychOpen.

Situations that are characterized by unexpected scenarios, unpredictable developments, and risks to life and health facilitate beliefs in conspiracy theories. These beliefs — together with reliable information, intentional and unintentional misinformation and rumors — determine attitudes toward the situations and ways to overcome them. Objective. To examine the effect of belief in conspiracy theories on the recognition of the need for quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic; the effect of personality traits on belief in conspiracy theories and on the recognition of the need for quarantine; the relationship of belief in conspiracy theories with assessment of the dangers of COVID-19 and with feelings of hopelessness. Design. The study was conducted over a period when the number of coronavirus cases was growing, during the first three weeks of the lockdown in Russia. The sample included 667 undergraduate and graduate students aged 16-31 (M = 20.44, SD = 2.38); 74.2% of the participants were women. Respondents filled out two online questionnaires. The first related to perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic; the second was a brief HEXACO inventory. Results. Belief in Conspiracy Theories accounts for 13% of variance in Recognition of the Need for Quarantine; together with Dangers of COV-ID-19 and Hopelessness, conspiracy beliefs account for more than a quarter of the variance. Personality traits defined in the context of the 6-factor personality model have a small effect on conspiracy beliefs about the coronavirus and on perception of the need for quarantine. Conclusion. Belief in conspiracy theories is associated not only with irrational views of reality, but also with the adoption of ineffective behaviors. © 2020. Lomonosov Moscow State University.

However, the last decade of financial hardships and ownership changes in the Greek media sector (2009-2019) gave rise to a widening of perception on the part of journalists of what really crisis stands for when it comes to their profession. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with Greek leading news media professionals from all types of media outlets (press, television, radio and news websites), the present research describes how journalists perceive, assess and manage the crisis of their profession in today’s networked media landscape, characterised by unprecedented phenomena such as the rise of churnalism, post truth journalism and fake news in the context of new trends with regard to how the Greek audience is seeking information and consuming news. While existing research on journalism profession has tended to emphasise the conversion of journalist into a multitasked employee towards audience members who treat journalism with suspicion, this chapter focusses on to what extent journalists by themselves are critical of their profession’s vulnerabilities such as the lack of genuine investigative journalism, alienation from the actual reporting based on primary material and manipulation of media professionals within an unstable market. The research gives insights into journalists’ opinions and attitudes with regard to the symptoms indicating that journalism in Greece is suffering from chronic and acute crises related to the extraction and dissemination of news, the relationship of journalists with media owners as well as the operation of the media market. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130921892"

This awareness can be better understood by studying the spread, structure and evolution of software vulnerability discussions across online communities. This work is the first to evaluate and contrast how discussions about software vulnerabilities spread on three social platforms- Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit. Moreover, we measure how user-level e.g., bot or not, and content-level characteristics e.g., vulnerability severity, post subjectivity, targeted operating systems as well as social network topology influence the rate of vulnerability discussion spread. To lay the groundwork, we present a novel fundamental framework for measuring information spread in multiple social platforms that identifies spread mechanisms and observables, units of information, and groups of measurements. We then contrast topologies for three social networks and analyze the effect of the network structure on the way discussions about vulnerabilities spread. We measure the scale and speed of the discussion spread to understand how far and how wide they go, how many users participate, and the duration of their spread. To demonstrate the awareness of more impactful vulnerabilities, a subset of our analysis focuses on vulnerabilities targeted during recent major cyber-attacks and those exploited by advanced persistent threat groups. One of our major findings is that most discussions start on GitHub not only before Twitter and Reddit, but even before a vulnerability is officially published. The severity of a vulnerability contributes to how much it spreads, especially on Twitter. Highly severe vulnerabilities have significantly deeper, broader and more viral discussion threads. When analyzing vulnerabilities in software products we found that different flavors of Linux received the highest discussion volume. We also observe that Twitter discussions started by humans have larger size, breadth, depth, adoption rate, lifetime, and structural virality compared to those started by bots. On Reddit, discussion threads of positive posts are larger, wider, and deeper than negative or neutral posts. We also found that all three networks have high modularity that encourages spread. However, the spread on GitHub is different from other networks, because GitHub is more dense, has stronger community structure and assortativity that enhances information diffusion. We anticipate the results of our analysis to not only increase the understanding of software vulnerability awareness but also inform the existing and new analytical frameworks for simulating information spread e.g., disinformation across multiple social environments online. © 2020 Shrestha et al.

Still, no experimental research examines how these ideas about mindfulness and mindfulness meditation influence responses to state mindfulness instruments designed to measure related outcomes. Methods: The current study implemented an experimental-experiential design to examine how the presentation of mindfulness via mindfulness theory-consistent(TC) and theory-inconsistent(TI) treatment rationales and subsequent mindfulness meditation practices (consistent with respective rationales) affected participants’ (n = 114) state mindfulness scores and perceptions of mindfulness. Self-reported trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS), state mindfulness (Toronto Mindfulness Scale, TMS; State Mindfulness Scale, SMS), and qualitative measurements (participant open entry) were utilized. Results: Despite vastly different presentations of mindfulness being utilized by participants (successful experimental manipulation; significant between-group differences in number of qualitative mindfulness misconceptions coded [TI > TC]), there were no significant differences between the two experimental groups on state mindfulness measures directly following TC and TI rationales and practices. No significant differences were observed between the TC and TI conditions for usability or perceived accuracy of the rationales and practices, and self-reported previous mindfulness experience did not predict one’s likelihood of providing qualitative misconceptions. Conclusions: When taught TI mindfulness meditation material, participants were more likely to respond with TI information even though state mindfulness measures after practice did not differ from the TC condition.

The increase in online news consumption suggests that people turn to the Internet for news because of the attractiveness of digital media even though some content is less than credible. Does web interactivity outweigh news credibility? This study aims to uncover which factor has a greater effect on how people consume online news in Malaysia; a country known for its media control. Using purposive sampling to recruit Malaysian news audience, we conducted an online survey on 520 respondents and later used Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. The findings show that both interactivity and credibility were significant predictors to people’s positive attitude towards online news and its consumption. The strength of the relationship linking credibility and news consumption was higher than the relationship between interactivity and news consumption. We also found that attitude towards online news was a significant mediator for both relationships; suggesting its influence on the increasing use of the Internet for news. Our data confirmed the importance of web interactivity and news credibility. However, news credibility is of greater importance than interactivity in predicting online news consumption among Malaysians. Finally, implications of the study are discussed in relation to the practice of media control and the threat of fake news dissemination on social media in Malaysia. © 2020, Taylor's University Lakeside Campus.

Drawing from literature in psychology, sociology, communication, and political science we identify and review four potential strategies to respond to climate denial. First, prebunking or inoculation may preemptively confer cognitive resistance and limit audience receptiveness to misinformation by teaching individuals how to identify and deconstruct flawed arguments, mitigating their persuasive appeal. Second, communicating the scientific consensus on climate change may provide a gateway to more accurate climate beliefs. Third, directly correcting misinformation can be effective, especially when using best practices that include simple rebuttals, replacement with correct facts, and reliance on expert sources. Fourth, technocognition solutions are particularly important online to facilitate identification and correction of misinformation as it emerges. Based on these strategies, we propose an agenda to help scientists, educators, and practitioners engage more effectively with climate change denial. © David C Holmes and Lucy M Richardson 2020.

The study hypothesises that fake news that violates one’s moral code could induce anger resulting in brand hate. Religiosity plays a role as a moderating variable for the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected in two studies using quasi-experiment repeated measures factorial design, 2 × 2 between subjects. In Study 1, 219 participated, whereas in Study 2, a total of 173 was recruited for the experiment. The study uses one-way repeated measures design ANOVA and MEMORE to test the effects of moderation for repeated measures. Findings: The findings indicate that fake news that violates one’s moral code, belief and values could induce anger and brand hate. Religiosity moderates the relationship between anger and brand hate Research limitations/implications: The study’s limitations include the limited dimension measured for religiosity and brand hate. Originality/value: The study of brand hate as opposed to brand love is relatively scarce. This study has observed how fake news that violates one’s moral code is detrimental to the brand, which in turn induces hate. Marketing managers have to be cautious in marketing their products in more religious countries.

Its impact has affected various social domains, including the media and journalism. Since the beginning of this health crisis, the news has become a valuable resource for citizens. Studying the dynamics of information consumption is highly relevant both for its ability to transform the media system and for its incidence in democracy. The objective of this research is to analyse the influence of the new coro-navirus on news consumption, the credibility given by citizens to the media as well as their ability to detect fake news. To answer these questions, we have conducted an exploratory analysis based on the secondary data from the online surveys of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel in the United States, comparing data before and after the outbreak. The results confirm the impact of Covid-19 on the media system. The findings suggest the emergence of im-portant developments such as the resurgence of the role of legacy media, especially television, and the fact that citizens who usually remain far from the information have reconnected with the news. Therefore, the existing inequalities regar-ding news consumption among citizens have been reduced, in part. This generates potential benefits for democracy in terms of equality and accessibility concerning public affairs. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

When such a claim appears with a related, but non-probative photo (e.g., a photo of a woodpecker perched on a tree) people are more likely to think the claim is true - a truthiness effect. This truthiness effect holds across a range of judgments, including judgments about general knowledge facts, predictions about future events, and judgments about our own episodic memories. Throughout, adding a photograph to a claim rapidly increases people’s belief in that claim. We review the literature on truthiness, documenting the ways in which photos and other kinds of non-probative information can rapidly change people’s beliefs, memories, and estimations of their own general knowledge.

MIL promotes the critical thinking skills that enable people to make independent choices, in particular how to evaluate and choose different information sources and channels, as well as how to interpret the news and information received through those channels. This article explores how young people in Lithuania evaluate the trustworthiness of news. Two groups of students were selected for the experiment: young people who had participated in a basic course in MIL, and young people whose learning was minimally related to MIL. The study was conducted using a survey and eye-tracking device that enabled researchers to record and analyse readers’ real behaviour and to identify the distribution of attention, i.e. the concentration of sight and time spent on particular news elements. The research results show a clear difference between these two groups and thus confirm the importance of media literacy education. © 2020 Polish Communication Association.

These users not only share textual content, but also images to emphasise their messages and influence their audiences. Though previous studies investigated the content of vaccine images, there is little research on how these visuals are distributed in digital environments. Therefore, this study explored how images related to vaccination are shared on Twitter to gain insight into the communities and networks formed around their dissemination. Moreover, this research also investigated who influences the distribution of vaccine images, and could be potential gatekeepers of vaccination information. We conducted a social network analysis on samples of tweets with images collected in June, September and October 2016. In each dataset, proand anti-vaccination users formed two polarised networks that hardly interacted with each other, and disseminated images among their members differently. The anti-vaccination users frequently retweeted each other, strengthening their relationships, making the information redundant within their community, and confirming their beliefs against immunisation. The pro-vaccine users, instead, formed a fragmented network, with loose but strategic connections that facilitated networking and the distribution of new vaccine information. Moreover, while the pro-vaccine gatekeepers were non-governmental organisations or health professionals, the anti-vaccine ones were activists and/or parents. Activists and parents could potentially be considered as alternative but trustworthy sources of information enabling them to disseminate misinformation about vaccinations. © 2020 by the authors;.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089000453"

She argues that researchers, policymakers, and journalists reporting on elections tend to focusing solely on technological vulnerabilities, while overlooking individuals’ cognitive shortcomings and societal vulnerabilities. Barojan examines these vulnerabilities in great detail by describing the “toxic information environment” created when they interact, which in turn facilitates the spread of disinformation and fake news. Barojan also describes some of the tactics that the DFR Lab has observed while monitoring elections around the world “to make sure that disinformation and nefarious influence campaigns did not have an effect on the outcome of these elections or the post-electoral discourse”. Case studies from elections in Moldova, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States illustrate the use of doctored videos, commercial and political bots (automated social media), and sock puppet (inauthentic social media) accounts. Barojan then lists a number of approaches to counter online hostile actors, which include participating in open source and digital forensic training events, following the research published by the DFR Lab to “inform the public of the challenge of disinformation”, maintaining transparent communication with the public, and harnessing the “power of technology” to track disinformation campaigns and digital manipulation in multiple languages. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131585672"

This study compared how individuals and pairs of secondary students worked to evaluate the quality of online information across two inquiry topics. Two similar studies were conducted with 140 Finnish (Study I) and 52 US (Study II) students. Students were asked to conduct an online inquiry and then write an essay about one of two topics: allowing the genetic modification of organisms (GMO) or the effects of social media on people’s quality of life (SM). Students worked either individually or in pairs. Their work was supported with a digital tool that prompted them to evaluate the credibility of online texts they selected as sources for their essays. Three separate analyses of covariance were conducted to examine differences in evaluation of online texts between individual and paired readers as well as between the inquiry topics across three dimensions: 1) total number of relevant justifications for credibility evaluations, 2) different types of relevant justifications, and 3) overall quality of students’ evaluations and justifications across all responses captured by the digital tool. Results showed that working in pairs appeared to support the evaluation of online information in all assessed aspects in one context (Study I) but not in another (Study II). In Study 1, the GMO topic appeared to stimulate students’ evaluation of information slightly more than SM, while there was no difference in evaluation performance across topics in Study 2. Findings suggest that discussing the credibility of online texts with a partner is a promising practice. Future research should explore more qualitative dimensions of how partners work together as they evaluate online texts and how instruction could be used to support collaborative evaluation. © 2019, Australian Literacy Educator's Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078880963"

Despite this prompt intervention, which increased the visibility and reliability of public health communication, coordinated efforts involving different institutions, media and digital platform companies still seem necessary to reduce the impact of misinformation, as using a multichannel strategy helps avoid increasing social and technological disparities at a time of crisis. © 2020 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088964005"

This study evaluated how high school students evaluate content on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Thirty-seven students from two different high schools in Western Australia (WA) completed a survey and series of eight activities that asked them to evaluate information (both visual and written) posted on social media sites. The results showed that students trust TV news more than social media. The results also showed that although students often recognised legitimate news sources versus opinion, they often fail to recognise bias when it relates to political or organisation affiliation. The students also did not verify accuracy or authority outside of the social media posts, trusted ‘evidence’ even when it was inaccurate, often did not recognise the verified tick and often failed to recognise that images and videos can be edited. This study has shown that media literacy instruction in schools needs to move away from the checklist approach of teaching how to evaluate information and move towards an instructional approach that focuses on the more critical thinking aspects of evaluation such as the source of the information, social and political bias and verifying evidence and information through multiple sources. © 2020 Nicole Johnston.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092748213"

Tandoc Jr. Assesses why people believe in and propagate false information found online. He does so through four components of communication—namely Sender, Message, Channel and Receiver—and examines the different factors that affect each one. Tandoc’s research reveals that an increasing number of people get their news from social media instead of local news websites, which leads to various consequences on all four components of communication. He explains that individuals judge a news story’s credibility not only on who shared it on social media, but also on the number of likes, comments, and shares. Fake news producers therefore often “produce clickbait content to get more people to like, share, or comment on their fake stories, often playing into readers’ biases or interests”. Tandoc proposes that although the majority of disinformation research has focused on Facebook and Twitter, “fake news now increasingly moves through closed social media applications, such as the messaging app WhatsApp”. He also delineates how fake news and disinformation thrives in times of uncertainty and in situations of information overload—combatting this issue will require a “multi-pronged approach involving technological, economic, legal, and social interventions”. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151228545"

Despite concern from federal officials about the amount of misleading dietary claims in popular media, many individuals believe and even take up this celebrity-based bad advice. A survey with manipulated stimuli (N = 466) builds upon social–cognitive theory and the appraisal theory of emotions to test a proposed conceptual model whereby audience involvement processes (i.e., identification, parasocial relationships, and liking) and social norm perceptions shape subsequent emotional and social–cognitive reactions, which in turn influence openness to celebrity-based nutrition misinformation. The results partially support the proposed model, indicating that pop culture media can influence audience vulnerability to diet-related misinformation. The findings presented here also offer guidance on ways to potentially mitigate celebrity-based misinformation by utilizing other relatable celebrities to deliver inspiring and accurate messages.

The Bowling Green Massacre. Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president. How should we combat such “fake news” stories, which often go viral? As cognitive scientists, we view this problem through the lens of what we know about the construction, representation, and updating of belief and knowledge more generally. That is, we argue that the same efficient processes that support the learning of veridical information also support the processing of fake news and sometimes produce false beliefs. Anchoring on the larger psychological literature on belief and knowledge highlights possible solutions while casting doubt on other possible interventions. For example, we are not optimistic about interventions that focus learners on assessing the credibility of information sources, given that such information is likely forgotten over time. Overall, we argue that the basic science of belief and knowledge provides a useful foundation for thinking about reactions to and consequences of fake news. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Rainer Greifeneder, Mariela E.

However, its rapid development and widespread also have provided an excellent convenience for the range of fake news, people are constantly exposed to fake news and suffer from it all the time. Fake news usually uses hyperbole to catch people’s eyes with dishonest intention. More importantly, it often misleads the reader and causes people to have wrong perceptions of society. It has the potential for negative impacts on society and individuals. Therefore, it is significative research on detecting fake news. In the paper, we built a model named SMHA-CNN (Self Multi-Head Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) that can judge the authenticity of news with high accuracy based only on content by using convolutional neural networks and self multi-head attention mechanism. In order to prove its validity, we conducted experiments on a public dataset and achieved a precision rate of 95.5% with a recall rate of 95.6% under the 5-fold cross-validation. Our experimental result indicates that the model is more effective at detecting fake news. © 2019 Fang et al.

These intentionally false stories or disinformation purporting to be news threaten the democratic role of mainstream media in creating a well-informed citizenry. There is hate speech, and disinformation directed at the royal family, the cabinet, prominent figures and the larger Swazi society. This study focuses on disinformation in the mainstream media, the Swazi Observer and the Times of Swaziland, and the strategies being adopted to combat it. The article adopts a qualitative methodological approach using in-depth interviews with journalists and qualitative content analysis of the newspapers as data-gathering methods. The study reveals that the dissemination of false information is partially a consequence of the secretive nature of Swazi society even on matters of public interest. This has resulted in people spreading false news through social media aimed at ridiculing those in authority. On the other hand, “fake news” has found its way into mainstream media as journalists use the internet and social media such as Facebook and Twitter as sources of news without verifying their authenticity due to the pressure to be the first to publish. © 2019 iMasa.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074018460"

Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this ""illusory truth effect"" for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader's political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., ""The earth is a perfect square""). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than has been previously assumed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053713255"

Do we use our reasoning abilities to convince ourselves that statements that align with our ideology are true, or does reasoning allow us to effectively differentiate fake from real regardless of political ideology? Here we test these competing accounts in two studies (total N = 3446 Mechanical Turk workers) by using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) as a measure of the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. We find that CRT performance is negatively correlated with the perceived accuracy of fake news, and positively correlated with the ability to discern fake news from real news – even for headlines that align with individuals’ political ideology. Moreover, overall discernment was actually better for ideologically aligned headlines than for misaligned headlines. Finally, a headline-level analysis finds that CRT is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively implausible (primarily fake) headlines, and positively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively plausible (primarily real) headlines. In contrast, the correlation between CRT and perceived accuracy is unrelated to how closely the headline aligns with the participant's ideology. Thus, we conclude that analytic thinking is used to assess the plausibility of headlines, regardless of whether the stories are consistent or inconsistent with one's political ideology. Our findings therefore suggest that susceptibility to fake news is driven more by lazy thinking than it is by partisan bias per se – a finding that opens potential avenues for fighting fake news. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048712299"

In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Although faculty do not intend to deceive students with this misinformation, nevertheless, it can have damaging consequences, including undermining students’ well-being and limiting their aspirations. We discuss two general types of misleading statements: misinformation about the economic model (e.g., that money and material possessions lead to happiness) and misinformation about what matters in life (e.g., that career success is the most important component in the fabric of life). Most of this misinformation is deeply rooted in our materialistic culture and economic system, and a belief in profit maximization as a predominant goal. Last, we discuss ways in which faculty can escape from providing this misinformation and help students find fulfilling paths in life. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060907263"

As information proliferation—the consumption and sharing of information—increases through social media and other communications technology, these limits create an attentional bottleneck, favoring information that is more likely to be searched for, attended to, comprehended, encoded, and later reproduced. In information-rich environments, this bottleneck influences the evolution of information via four forces of cognitive selection, selecting for information that is belief-consistent, negative, social, and predictive. Selection for belief-consistent information leads balanced information to support increasingly polarized views. Selection for negative information amplifies information about downside risks and crowds out potential benefits. Selection for social information drives herding, impairs objective assessments, and reduces exploration for solutions to hard problems. Selection for predictive patterns drives overfitting, the replication crisis, and risk seeking. This article summarizes the negative implications of these forces of cognitive selection and presents eight warnings that represent severe pitfalls for the naive “informavore,” accelerating extremism, hysteria, herding, and the proliferation of misinformation. © The Author(s) 2018.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058710835"

In particular, we focus on problems related to the hidden wonders of science and the shiny images produced for scientific papers or to appeal to wider audiences. Background As rumors (hoaxes) and false news (fake news) explode across society and the current network, several initiatives using current technology have been launched to study this phenomena and limit the social impact. Over the last two decades, inappropriate scientific behavior has raised more questions about whether some scientific images are valid. Methodology This work is not about analyzing whether today's images are objective. Instead, we advocate for a general approach that makes it easier to truly believe in all kinds of knowledge, scientific or otherwise (Goldman, 1967; Goldman, & Olson, 2009). This need to believe is closely related to social order (Shapin, 1994). Contribution We conclude that we must ultimately move away from older ideas about truth and objectivity in research to broadly approach how science and knowledge are represented and move forward with this theoretical approach when communicating science to the public. Findings Contemporary visual culture suggests that our world is expressed through images, which are all around us. Therefore, we need to promote the reliability of scientific pictures, which visually represent knowledge, to add meaning in a world of complex high-tech science (Allamel-Raffin, 2011; Greenberg, 2004; Rosenberger, 2009). Since the time of Galileo, and today more than ever, scientific activity should be understood as knowledge produced to reveal, and therefore inform us of, (Wise, 2006) all that remains unexplained in our world, as well as everything beyond our senses. Recommendations for Practitioners In journalism, published scientific images must be properly explained. Journalists should tell people the truth, not fake objectivity. Recommendations for Researchers Today we must understand that scientific knowledge is mapped, simulated, and accessed through interfaces, and is uncertain. The scientific community needs to approach and explain how knowledge is represented, while paying attention to detail. Impact on Society It is sometimes hard to build data that represents scientific truth. More so, data could also be designed to intentionally fake knowledge. This leads to huge consequences when it comes to how the public understands science. Future Research In today's expanding world, scientific research takes a more visual approach. It is important for both the scientific community and the public to understand how the technologies used to visually represent knowledge can account for why, for example, we know more about electrons than we did a century ago (Arabatzis, 1996), or why we are beginning to carefully understand the complexities and ethical problems related to images used to promote knowledge through the media (see, i.e., López-Cantos, 2017). © 2019, Informing Science: the International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072259898"

This edition addresses the relatively new phenomenon of “fake news” and its complicated relationship with advertising. The authors highlight that advertising and fake news appear to be locked in a growth cycle driven by financial incentives. Most concerning for brands is that, because online programmatic advertising has required advertisers to cede control over where their advertisements are displayed, many brands inevitably will find their advertisements on fake-news websites alongside controversial and inflammatory content. Beyond the ethical dilemma for brands is the potential loss of credibility. For established brands, the situation is less dire, however, and, there may be room for a higher service option that gives advertisers tighter control over the display of their advertisements. © 2019, World Advertising Research Center.

In this study, we looked at effects of dress and speech style of a co-witness had on the credibility of that witness and the amount of misinformation that was accepted from the witness. The co-witness was a confederate that provided 5 pieces of misinformation in his video recorded testimony. Each participant viewed a video of the co-witness wearing either a dress shirt and tie or a plain sweatshirt, while talking either powerlessly (includes pauses, hesitations, and filler words) or powerfully (does not include pauses, hesitations, and filler words). The results indicated that the participants accepted more of the misinformation when the co-witness was dressed professionally rather than when he was dressed casually. The results also showed that the overall credibility, confidence, trustworthiness, and knowledgeability of the co-witness were rated significantly higher in the powerful group than in the powerless group. A significant interaction between dress and speech style for overall credibility was found such that in the casual dress condition, the powerful speech condition produced higher credibility ratings than did the powerless speech condition, but in the professional dress condition speech style did not affect credibility. A significant interaction between dress and speech style on knowledgeability showed the same pattern.

In particular, I will argue that ignorance, like knowledge, is situated in the eco-cognitive environment of the epistemic agents and it can also be distributed among them by exploiting the functionality of context-based information-sharing mechanisms. Thus, by understanding how information and knowledge are distributed in specialized environments, we should be able to get a picture of how ignorance is equally shared in the same contexts. Therefore, to study ignorance distribution in epistemically rich contexts, I will employ cognitive niche theories, which deal with how knowledge and information are actively and passively shared among group of people.

To answer this, we draw upon data from seventy-one in-depth interviews in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Miami. We found that perceptions about the overall media ecosystem were characterized by a: a) negative view of the current quality of news reporting, b) particular distrust of news circulation on social media; and c) concern about the effects of these trends mainly on the information habits of others. To counter these perceptions, participants indicated to rely on: a) traditional fact-based media, accompanied by a rejection of opinionated outlets; b) personal experience and knowledge; c) repetition of information across outlets; d) consumption of cross-ideological sources; e) fact-checking; and f) trust in certain personal contacts on social media, who are perceived as assessors of news quality. Our findings suggest that: a) news consumption is being ritualized in new and more personalized ways; b) social media is seen as a gateway to news partly because audiences find opinion leaders in terms of their skills as credibility assessors; and c) journalism could cater more to audiences’ demands for more fact-oriented and less discussion-based content. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070957389"

Social class refers to the division of individuals or groups of culture based on wealth, income, education, type of occupation, and social network. Social class matters because it shapes individuals’ experience of themselves in the world. I argue that socioeconomic factors matter when you discuss beliefs, values, and norms.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that various news outlets are disseminating 'fake news' for political purposes. But when the information contained in mainstream media news reports provides no clear clues about its truth value or any indication of a partisan slant, do people rely on the congeniality of the news outlet to judge whether the information is true or false? In a survey experiment, we presented partisans (Democrats and Republicans) and ideologues (liberals and conservatives) with a news article excerpt that varied by source shown (CNN, Fox News, or no source) and content (true or false information), and measured their perceived accuracy of the information contained in the article. Our results suggest that the participants do not blindly judge the content of articles based on the news source, regardless of their own partisanship and ideology. Contrary to prevailing views on the polarization and politicization of news outlets, as well as on voters' growing propensity to engage in 'partisan motivated reasoning,' source cues are not as important as the information itself for partisans on both sides of the aisle.

Unfortunately, this myopic focus on technology has led to insufficient attention being paid to the underlying human factors driving the success of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. Academic research on disinformation strongly suggests that belief in false or misleading information is driven more by individual emotional and cognitive responses - amplified by macro social, political and cultural trends - than specific information technologies. Thus, attention given to countering the distribution and promulgation of disinformation through specific technological platforms, at the expense of understanding the human factors at play, hampers the ability of public diplomacy efforts countering it. This article addresses this lacuna by reviewing the underlying psychology of three common types of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns and identifying lessons for designing effective public diplomacy counter-strategies in the future. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140683249"

Building on the framework of how audiences act to authenticate information, this study provides a user perspective on which strategies people use in evaluating information in OSN. In 15 qualitative interviews, participants were asked to think aloud while evaluating whether the content of posts from their own newsfeeds and of interviewer-supplied posts was true or false. Their answers were analyzed to determine which evaluation strategies they used. Analyzing participants' thoughts as they evaluate information is more reliable than directly asking participants which strategies they think they use. Results show that users' strategies in information evaluation are searching for more information, knowledge of account or content carries the most weight, and every detail needs to fit. A comparison of strategy usage for posts from befriended versus unknown personal accounts as well as for posts from followed news outlets versus not followed news outlets shows that for posts from followed news outlets, knowledge of the account was the most-used strategy followed by knowledge of the content. For other types of posts, strategy usage varied more widely and depended on each post. This highlights the importance and possible higher ecological validity of research on posts from news outlets that users actually follow, as users' experiences with previous posts seem to play a major role in how they go about evaluating information in new posts. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language.

The present study sought to determine whether high-NFC individuals would be more likely to detect discrepancies between the original event and the misinformation, making them less susceptible to the influence of misinformation. This was hypothesised because high-NFC individuals should be more likely to engage in effortful processing that could be used to carefully monitor the source of misinformation and detect discrepancies in order to avoid false memories. Further, when presented with misinformation, high-NFC individuals had more accurate memories and accepted less misinformation than low-NFC individuals.

We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (“fake news”). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans—mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans—every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In an era when technological innovations support increasingly inexpensive and easy ways to produce media that looks official, the ability to separate real from artificial has become increasingly complicated and difficult. Some of the responsibility for public manipulation certainly rests with those who present false or artificial information as real. However, their relative success depends on, at least in part, universal psychological processes that often make humans susceptible to believing things that are not true. For example, people often weigh emotional feelings more heavily than facts in their decision making.

However, the traditional analysis of the concept, which requires that a deceiver intentionally cause her victim to have a false belief, rules out the possibility of much deception in the animal kingdom. Cognitively unsophisticated species, such as fireflies and butterflies, have simply evolved to mislead potential predators and/or prey. To capture such cases of “functional deception,” several researchers (e.g., Sober, From a biological point of view, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994; Hauser in: Whiten, Byrne (eds) Machiavellian intelligence II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp 112–143, 1997; Searcy and Nowicki, The evolution of animal communication, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2005; Skyrms, Signals, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2010) have endorsed the broader view that deception only requires that a deceiver benefit from sending a misleading signal. Moreover, in order to facilitate game-theoretic study of deception in the context of Lewisian sender-receiver games, Brian Skyrms has proposed an influential formal analysis of this view. Such formal analyses have the potential to enhance our philosophical understanding of deception in humans as well as animals. However, as we argue in this paper, Skyrms’s analysis, as well as two recently proposed alternative analyses (viz., Godfrey-Smith in Review of signals: evolution, learning, and information by Brian Skyrms, Mind, 120: 1288–1297, 2001; McWhirter in Brit J Philos Sci 67: 757–780, 2016), are seriously flawed and can lead us to draw unwarranted conclusions about deception. © 2017, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029591056"

The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to “fake news” attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis. © 2018 Kopp et al.

In the face of this, the popularity and relevance of fact-checking services have increased in recent years. Nevertheless, not much is known about the effectiveness of these journalistic entities. This study proposes a theoretical framework that systemizes possible influencing factors. An online survey of 607 German media users was conducted, measuring the effectiveness of several clarifications in adjusting recipients' misperceptions about six current controversial issues in Germany. The results indicate that journalistic clarifications are in fact capable of causing an adjustment process. Regression analyses show that, contrary to expectations, the users' attitudes that go against the message of the clarification had only a small effect on the adjustment process. Media reliance had positive effects on only one issue, as well, and cognitive mobilization on two issues. A positive evaluation of the quality of the clarification showed effects in four cases, but not always as expected. Evaluations of the credibility of the communicator delivered no effects. © 2019 Institute of the Lithuanian Language.

Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories is—at the very—least understandable (because conspiracies occur) and if we take an evidential approach—judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits—belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases. Drawing on this work, I examine the kinds of evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the evidential problems typically associated with conspiracy theories are not unique to such theories. As such, if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error?

This study therefore explores the effects of exposure to summaries of fact-check ratings, a new format that presents a more comprehensive assessment of politician statement accuracy over time. Across three survey experiments, we compared the effects of negative individual statement ratings and summary fact-checking data on favorability and perceived statement accuracy of two prominent elected officials. As predicted, summary fact-checking had a greater effect on politician perceptions than individual fact-checking. Notably, we did not observe the expected pattern of motivated reasoning: co-partisans were not consistently more resistant than supporters of the opposition party. Our findings suggest that summary fact-checking is particularly effective at holding politicians accountable for misstatements. © The Author(s) 2019.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071722932"

However, sources might include misinformation, a phenomenon also called 'fake news'. In this study, the contribution of students' affective engagement and behaviour disposition on Italian university students' multiple-document comprehension will be investigated. In specific, the focus was put on trustworthiness judgements and use of justification criteria when reading documents on the controversial topic of vaccination. Participants were 289 university students. The procedure included four steps. Firstly, students were administered the tests measuring prior beliefs, topic interest and prior knowledge. Secondly, students read six documents varying by position towards vaccination and reliability. Thirdly, students were asked to report their use of processing strategies. Finally, students were asked to judge the trustworthiness of the six documents and report to what extent they had relied on specific trustworthiness criteria. Overall results confirmed the existence of four default stances adopted to complete the reading task, which are significantly associated with trustworthiness judgements. Students' affective engagement should be targeted by enhancing their topic interest, and intervention should promote cross-document strategic processing. © 2019 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071942670"

Background Clickbaits are online articles with deliberately designed misleading titles for luring more and more readers to open the intended web page. Clickbaits are used to tempted visitors to click on a particular link either to monetize the landing page or to spread the false news for sensationalization. The presence of clickbaits on any news aggregator portal may lead to an unpleasant experience for readers. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish clickbaits from authentic headlines to mit-igate their impact on readers' perception. Methodology A total of one hundred thousand article headlines are collected from news ag-gregator sites consists of clickbaits and authentic news headlines. The collected data samples are divided into five training sets of balanced and unbalanced data. The natural language processing techniques are used to extract 19 manually se-lected features from article headlines. Contribution Three ensemble learning techniques including bagging, boosting, and random forests are used to design a classifier model for classifying a given headline into the clickbait or non-clickbait. The performances of learners are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measures. Findings It is observed that the random forest classifier detects clickbaits better than the other classifiers with an accuracy of 91.16 %, a total precision, recall, and f-measure of 91 %. © 2019 Informing Science Institute.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067662648"

Fatalism has been suggested as a mechanism for health disparities because ethnic minorities are especially likely to hold fatalistic beliefs. However, the construct has been criticized: Fatalism fails to account for structural barriers to health faced by vulnerable populations that also score highly on measures of fatalism. Another critique suggests that operationalizations of fatalism expose communication failures: “Fatalism” rather reflects information overload from an environment riddled with misinformation and contradictions. This study aimed to expand understanding of one mechanism through which communication may contribute to disparities by considering the context of nutrition among bicultural Latinas, who face increased risk from dietary acculturation. Method: Mixed-methods (semi-structured in-depth interview, survey) with Mexican-American women ages 18–29 (n = 24) in rural California. Results: Contrary to previous studies, the majority of this sample of Mexican-American women did not endorse fatalistic beliefs; most demonstrated clear understanding of the link between diet and risk of diseases: Diabetes and heart disease were understood to result from behaviors within one's control. Yet despite articulating links between diet and disease, participants felt overloaded and confused about conflicting information from public and interpersonal sources. Moreover, despite reporting feeling inundated with information, participants noted critical information gaps, distinguishing between information available and information needed. Conclusions: We found minimal support for fatalistic beliefs among a sample of Mexican-American women, but considerable information overload and confusion, together with a desire for specific knowledge and skills. Results extend understanding of how communication may influence disparities: Information overload may be conflated with fatalism, challenging the notion that fatalism is a cultural belief. Moreover, inequalities in access to and ability to process information compound overload effects. We discuss opportunities to improve the clarity of communication about nutrition science and dietary recommendations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054915353"

Surprisingly, no marketing study to date has analyzed the effect of fake news on consumers’ evaluations of a brand advertised on the same webpage. To fill this gap, this study empirically investigated whether individuals’ perceptions of fake news transfer to an adjacent brand advertisement. Specifically, we manipulated news truthfulness and source credibility, observing the change in individuals’ responses while distinguishing between objective truthfulness and the perceived credibility of the news. The results confirmed that the news’ objective truthfulness exerts no direct effect on behavioral intentions toward the brand (i.e., intention to purchase, spread word-of-mouth, or visit the brand's store). However, we did uncover a chain of effects whereby the impact of fake news on behavioral intentions was fully mediated by people's perceptions of the news’ credibility, which affected the perceived credibility of the sources, which then influenced brand trust, which finally translated into brand attitudes. From a managerial perspective, this study's results can partially reassure brand managers that their brand advertisements will not suffer from appearing next to fake news when the source itself is credible. © 2018","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059746065"

Oftentimes, one's beliefs are influenced by superficial characteristics of the belief evaluation experience. Here, we show that by manipulating the mnemonic accessibility of particular beliefs we can alter their believability. We use a well-established socio-cognitive paradigm (i.e., the social version of the selective practice paradigm) to increase the mnemonic accessibility of some beliefs and induce forgetting in others. We find that listening to a speaker selectively practicing beliefs results in changes in believability. Beliefs that are mentioned become mnemonically accessible and exhibit an increase in believability, while beliefs that are related to those mentioned exrience mnemonic suppression, which results in decreased believability. Importantly, the latter effect occurs regardless of whether the belief is scientifically accurate or inaccurate. Furthermore, beliefs that are endorsed with moderate-strength are particularly susceptible to mnemonically-induced believability changes.

They differ from traditional media as people are exposed to stories from a variety of people and outlets, including potential fake news stories. This raises a key question: What leads people to trust news on social media? Research indicates two cues that could impact opinions of news on social media: (1) the trustworthiness of the person who shares a story; (2) the credibility of the news outlet reporting the story. This study tests those factors simultaneously with a recent survey experiment of American adults that simulates social media posts by either a trusted or untrusted public figure and directs respondents to an article manipulated to come from either a reputable news source or a fake news source. The findings highlight the impact elites sharing a story has on views toward an article on social media compared with the effects of the news outlet reporting the story. The study has significant implications for researchers, citizens, and publishers trying to understand how people evaluate the trustworthiness of news on social media and the potential impact of fake news. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067437575"

A folk belief captured by the phrase 'rain follows the plow' (RFTP) is a prime example of such misinformation. This belief, popular in the late nineteenth century, maintained that cultivation of arid lands in the United States beyond the 100th meridian west would boost precipitation, creating a climate more favourable for farming. Encouraged by this narrative, homesteaders cultivated arid lands west of the meridian. Rain did not follow the plough and many farms in the Great Plains failed. RFTP was also invoked in South Australia in support of agricultural settlement north of Goyder's Line, a geographical boundary delineating the limits of reliable rainfall in the colony. This article revisits the origins of the doctrine and places RFTP messaging in its historical context by examining articles and poetry published in American and Australian settlement-era newspapers. The results of two newspaper database surveys reveal that a number of historical RFTP stories and an environmental poem with religious overtones appeared first in US newspapers and were later republished in newspapers throughout Australia. One of the surveys also reveals that, from 1876 to 1898, reports of parliamentary discussions or debates referencing the slogan were published in South Australia. The dissemination of inaccurate climate information in settlement-era America and Australia is discussed in relation to a proposed conceptual framework based upon contemporary theories of science communication that might provide a basis for the analysis of historical science messaging. © 2019 ANU Press.

I argue that the relationship between knowledge and populism needs a more nuanced analysis. Many have noted that populism valorises ‘common sense’ over expertise. But another populist strategy is counterknowledge, proposing politically charged alternative knowledge authorities in the stead of established ones. I analyse countermedia in Finland, where they have played a part in the rise of right-wing populism, using a combination of computational and interpretive methods. In my data, right-wing populists advocate counterknowledge; they profess belief in truth achievable by inquiry, not by mainstream experts but alternative ones. This is a different knowledge orientation from the valorisation of ‘common sense’, and there is reason to believe it is somewhat specific to contemporary right-wing anti-immigration populism.

However it is critical of ‘Islamophobia’ as a valid concept in the social science. In the sociology of Islam, it actually distorts research by concentrating on Muslims as invariably victims of social forces. This article is a modest proposal to reconsider differences between science and advocacy concepts, thereby recognising their different and distinctive roles in social movements and academic institutions. It is important that those undertaking any scholarly study of detrimental social behaviour motivated by hatred possess valid theoretical and empirical tools to counter false information or distorted views of minorities. To this extent, Islamophobia is a valuable advocacy concept in the public sphere and scholars should aim to keep it there. However, the article explores the history and deployment of Islamophobia as an advocacy concept and exposes its limitations as scientific description of social reality. There are two contrasted conclusions to this critique. The pessimistic view is that all human societies are constructed around social groups that have exclusionary boundaries. Although boundaries are always changing, the inclusion/exclusion dynamic never wholly disappears. Policy efforts enhance cosmopolitan virtues. The optimistic conclusion is that advocacy concepts and scientific practices, while not entirely compatible, are not systematically opposed. Advocacy may have greater effect when it is grounded in reliable facts and tested assumptions.

In three experiments, we tested whether calls to limit the number of counterarguments are justified. We found that a larger number of counterarguments (between four and six) led to as much or more belief reduction compared to a smaller number of (two) counterarguments.

These efforts have focused primarily on the role of social media in exposing youth to factually inaccurate civic information and the factors that influence the ability to discern the accuracy of such information. A less explored aspect has been the impact of the rise of “outrage language,” defined as language that evokes strong emotional responses (e.g., fear, anger, disgust) that communications scholars have documented as playing a larger role in political discourse over the past few decades (Berry & Sobieraj, 2014). This article draws on three recent studies of digital media and youth civic engagement to discuss (a) the role of participatory media in exposing youth to outrage language in civic discourse, (b) the challenges of balancing attention to the emotional and factual elements when participating in online civic discourse, and (c) how the development of online counterpublics through high school classrooms can help students create models of productive online discourse.

In particular, social scientists have focused much of this work on conspiracy theories given how such theories can undermine government initiatives. The extant literature shows: (1) that the current information environment allows conspiracy theories to spread among citizens farther and faster than ever before; (2) that most Americans believe conspiracy theories; and (3) that conspiracy theories can generate undesirable political and social outcomes. While social scientists have been working to both understand and correct conspiracy beliefs, this literature has yet to inform or to be informed by the relevant scholarship in public administration.

The goal of the research is to assess the task of fact-checking developed by initiatives that use Spanish as a vehicle for comparing inaccurate and false information. We carried out a case study of 19 international projects that use Spanish as the main language to materialise their fact-checking actions and the analysis of contents published aims at understanding where these companies develop their activities, how are them internally organized and which methods they use to translate the data obtained to the audience. Results show that most of fact-checking projects in Spanish –launched most of them in the period 2014-2016– remain active. In South America, these organizations have more weight. Most of them have a journalistic nature, although there is a large number of civic and independent projects.

Another objective is to infer the intent of the authors, where relevant. Design/Methodology/Approach: A conceptual analysis of three hundred fifty articles or monographies from all types of disciplines with a priority of the articles focused on terminological analysis was being utilized. A conceptual map of the terminology that is relevant to the post-truth era was created. In the case of the lack of agreement, the etymology of the terms, utilizing dictionaries, terminological databases and encyclopedias, was favored. Results/Discussion: The approach made possible to delimit the borders between the core terms of post-truth society and to classify them according to the intents of the authors: power (influence), money, fun, sexual harassment, hate/discord, ignorance, passion and socialization. These features were identified to be able to differentiate the concepts: falsity (misleadingness, deceptiveness, lack of verification), accuracy, completeness, currency, medium, intent and analyzable unit. The conceptual map, summarizing and visualizing our findings is attached in the article. Conclusions: We argued that disinformation and misinformation are different terms with different authors and intents in the online environment. Likewise, fake news was delimitated as species of disinformation, which is limited by the medium and financial intent. The intent of hoaxers is rather the amusement of the authors or to spread discord between different groups of society. The intent and analyzable units as statement, claim, article, message, event, story and narrative that were identified in the literature, are crucial for the understanding and communication between social (human) scientists and computer scientists in order to better detect and mitigate various types of false information. Originality/Value: The study provides a theoretical background for detecting, analyzing and mitigating false information and misbehavior. © 2019 Biblioteca Nacional de Cuba Jose Marti.

Both regions have a well-documented appetite for conspiracy theories and indeed the power of disinformation and propaganda, which seem to have gathered steam in the wake of deliberate dissemination of hoaxes or sensationalist stories predominantly distributed via social media platforms, potentially posing a threat to the credibility of journalism. This article provides an updated state of affairs on the expansion of “fake news” in the Middle East and Africa arguing after an explorative examination of 10 journalism curriculums that educators need to focus on local contexts when preparing journalism modules. Although it is important to discuss global trends, developments, controversies, debates, and discussions involving the “fake news” movement, we think future journalists from both regions would benefit from media literacy courses that identify the difference between fact and fiction in relation to their own contexts.

However, it is currently unclear what factors may influence an individual's likelihood to believe in FN, outside of political identity. As FN is often conspiratorial in nature and usually negative, it was theorised that conspiracist belief, and factors that have been found to relate to a conspiratorial worldview (i.e., dangerous worldview and schizotypy), may also relate to political FN. Method: A correlational design (N = 125, M = 27.6, SD = 4.26), was used to examine predictors of FN. Results: Political viewpoint was a consistent predictor of FN endorsement. Conspiratorial worldview and schizotypal personality also predicted FN belief, with weaker or less consistent prediction by other variables including dangerous worldview, normlessness, and randomness beliefs. Partial correlation analysis suggested that most variables related to FN through their association with conspiracist ideation and political identity beliefs. Conclusion: Prior political beliefs and the tendency for conspiracist ideation appear particularly important for individuals' endorsement of FN, regardless of prior exposure to the specific news presented. As such, conspiracy theory (CT) belief and its underlying mechanisms appear a useful starting point in identifying some of the underlying individual difference variables involved in conspiratorial and non-conspiratorial FN belief.

Evidence points to partisan segmentation in the contemporary news market, but while assumptions abound, the mechanism driving consumers to sort along party lines is unclear. I develop a framework for news choice based on perceptions of objectivity and credibility and report a test of its central mechanism using a nationally representative survey experiment. I find support for a congenial media effect, where news content from an unfamiliar source is seen as more credible and less biased when it is consistent with existing beliefs, while balanced news content may be dismissed as less credible and biased. Previous studies have examined how perceptions of bias in identical news content can change when it is attributed to different sources. In today’s media world however, access to more news sources generally and the ease with which content from those sources can be shared makes it increasingly likely people will be exposed to news content from either unknown or potentially fake news sources. This study contributes to the literature by identifying the unique effect of message content on perceptions of news bias and source credibility, while holding source constant. Paradoxically, my findings indicate that political selective exposure may arise out of individuals’ genuine desire for unbiased news. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044450050"

Darwin claims that middle chains are missing or extinct, but even if we found them, they would only prove similarities among kinds.' Here, Sir Sayyid’s reference to the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) was not to discredit or defend Darwin’s theory of evolution, but to support his own position on the topic, outlined in ‘Adna Halat’. In the article, Sir Sayyid argued that humans evolved overtime from a common animal ancestor and this process is guided by a divine creator. He also believed that this process was not antagonistic towards Islamic beliefs and the Qur’an. Overall, this position tied in with his general approach to the relationship between science and Islam, one where science was a part of Islam; the other part being the Qur’an. Although most of Sir Sayyid’s views on evolution have appeared in various articles he wrote over the course of his life, ‘Adna Halat’ presents a detailed summary of his perspective regarding the origin and development of living things, including humans, from a common animal ancestor. Today, the theory of evolution by natural selection is officially accepted by scientific establishments worldwide, including countries with a Muslim majority, but many people remain unconvinced or apprehensive about this theory. While the scientific community continues to discuss and debate issues in the field of evolutionary biology, such as the role of genetics in the evolutionary process, some individuals are attempting to disprove the evolutionary thought all together. Some of these individuals go back to Darwin and point out flaws in his theory of natural selection, like the lack of adequate understanding of inheritance, while others claim that life is too complicated to have developed by chance and to support various views of divine creation. Providing evidence against a scientific theory backed with empirical observation and evidence is one thing, but discrediting it based on misinformation may lead to greater issues in the public sphere, including how evolution is taught in schools.

Unfortunately, this myopic focus on technology has led to insufficient attention being paid to the underlying human factors driving the success of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. Academic research on disinformation strongly suggests that belief in false or misleading information is driven more by individual emotional and cognitive responses - amplified by macro social, political and cultural trends - than specific information technologies. Thus, attention given to countering the distribution and promulgation of disinformation through specific technological platforms, at the expense of understanding the human factors at play, hampers the ability of public diplomacy efforts countering it. This article addresses this lacuna by reviewing the underlying psychology of three common types of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns and identifying lessons for designing effective public diplomacy counter-strategies in the future. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065084769"

It is symptomatic of the collapse of the old news order and the chaos of contemporary public communication. These developments attest to a new chapter in the old struggle over the definition of truth—governments waging propaganda wars, elites, and corporations vie to dominate news coverage, and mainstream journalism’s continuous efforts to claim to provide authoritative reportage of current events. The communication chaos makes it necessary to revisit normative arguments about journalism and democracy as well as their feasibility in radically new conditions.

A recent study in the context of the 2016 US election found that fact-checks of statements by Donald Trump changed participants' beliefs about those statements-regardless of whether participants supported Trump-but not their feelings towards Trump or voting intentions. However, the study balanced corrections of inaccurate statements with an equal number of affirmations of accurate statements. Therefore, the null effect of fact-checks on participants' voting intentions and feelings may have arisen because of this artificially created balance. Moreover, Trump's statements were not contrasted with statements from an opposing politician, and Trump's perceived veracity was not measured. The present study (N = 370) examined the issue further, manipulating the ratio of corrections to affirmations, and using Australian politicians (and Australian participants) from both sides of the political spectrum. We hypothesized that fact-checks would correct beliefs and that fact-checks would affect voters' support (i.e. voting intentions, feelings and perceptions of veracity), but only when corrections outnumbered affirmations. Both hypotheses were supported, suggesting that a politician's veracity does sometimes matter to voters. The effects of fact-checking were similar on both sides of the political spectrum, suggesting little motivated reasoning in the processing of fact-checks. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059668219"

Youth are the powerful agents of social change. The study adopts UN stated citizenry between the age of 15-34 years as a youth. Youth presently comprises a significant part of the Indian population. India is anticipated to have a 34.33% share of youth in the total population by 2020. Social media is capturing plenty of popularity, study divulges that the average person spends additional time each day on their smartphone and PCs than they do sleeping. The youth expends more than 27 hours a week on social media platforms. Social media enables them to communicate and stay in touch with their social peers 24 x 7. Youth is plugged with the internet and aware of the constant updates. Media literacy becomes imperative for the youth as they are the social agents, if social agents are not media literate then the development of the country will hamper. Mis informed youth can create confusion and will be misled. Media literacy is to educate and make aware to the youth about the different media sources, content and how to read the content. The focus of the study is to promote media literacy among Indian Youth. This study intends to make Indian youth an expository thinker of the media content so that they can develop critical thinking, become analytical choosers, and inculcate critical reading skills. The study tries to probe the sagacity of Medial literacy amid Indian Youth through online surveys. The study is done on social media users who devour the internet more than two hours per day. The sample consumes information mainly political followed by entrainment and then International and sports. The survey reveals that the Indian youth face disinformation on social media routinely and sometimes they can unearth fake news and sometimes take it as truth. They find it hard to identify reliable and unreliable sources. The findings reveal that the Indian youth is somewhat aware of the media literacy but feel that media literacy should be enforced powerfully among the Indian citizens. The youth believes that thinking critically should be the main motive of media literacy followed by understanding the authors goal, creating media responsibly and become a smart consumer. The study concludes that social media platforms along with the government bear a responsibility to make Indian youth acquainted with the media literacy campaigns. Media literacy among youth can be imposed by organizing training programs, workshops by colleges and other educational institutions, incorporate in school and college curriculum. © 2019 Amity University.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087317124"

One explanation for this finding is that after taking a memory test, participant witnesses are more likely to treat the subsequently presented misinformation narrative as being credible (the misinformation acceptance account; e.g., Chan, Manley, & Lang, 2017). Another explanation suggests that prior testing enhances participants’ ability to learn the post-event misinformation (the test-potentiated learning account; Chan et al., 2017). In two experiments, we provided a direct test of these alternative hypotheses and showed that testing did not make participants believe the content of the narrative to be more accurate, and the perceived accuracy of the narrative was not associated with the likelihood of misinformation recall.

Background: Society is facing a significant challenge from the spread of misinformation through websites and social media that has driven a divergence in people’s perceptions and understanding of basic facts associated with many issues relevant to public policy decisions, including the economy, taxation, and the deficit; climate change and the environment; and vaccinations and public health and safety. A number of factors are driving this fracture, including information presentation challenges that lead to poor information understanding, deliberate information attacks, social network propagation, poor assessments of information reliability, and cognitive biases that lead to a rejection of information that conflicts with preexisting beliefs. Results: A framework for understanding information attack is provided, including common sources, features, avenues, cognitive mechanisms, and major challenges in overcoming information attacks.

Information bubbles reinforce existing beliefs and predispositions; d) the phenomenon is increased in contexts of proximity, be it geographical proximity provided by regional media or thematic and ideological proximity shared in online groups. Despite this, there is a difference between contexts of proximity in traditional communities and mechanisms of propaganda that have a significant level of organization and ideological polarization.

Not only is misinformation challenging to correct, but even when individuals accept corrective information, misinformation can continue to influence attitudes: a phenomenon known as belief echoes, affective perseverance, or the continued influence effect. Two controlled experiments tested the efficacy of narrative-based correctives to reduce this affective residual in the context of misinformation about organic tobacco. Study 1 (N = 385) tested within-narrative corrective endings, embedded in four discrete emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear). Study 2 (N = 586) tested the utility of a narrative with a negative, emotional corrective ending (fear and anger). Results provide some evidence that narrative correctives, with or without emotional endings, can be effective at reducing misinformed beliefs and intentions, but narratives consisting of emotional corrective endings are better at correcting attitudes than a simple corrective.

I have no aim to give a full systematic treatment of the topic. Rather, I will bring forward some remarks, partly inspired by personal experience. I think turning 70 and retiring, at least formally, brings me into a situation where a kind of retrospective narcissism may be legitimate. During the almost 50 years in which I have been engaged in sociology of religion, important - some would say paradigmatic - changes have taken place in the field of social science. The old and strict positivism has been criticized through and through for many years now. Very few sociologists today believe that they can approach an objective reality in an objective way. Although finding social patterns is still an important aim for sociologists, they rarely conceive of the world as completely governed by objective social laws, paralleling the laws of nature. They do not believe that they can uncover these absolute laws through the help of exact methods and sufficient funding. Today, looking for contextual constraints is an integral part of the social-scientific project, and most sociologists acknowledge that there is an unpredictable element both in agency and society, since human beings have intentions and are able to go in many directions, except in situations of extreme control. Furthermore, the confidence in social science has become more modest and realistic since August Comte, the French philosopher who coined the term sociology, first named his new science social physics almost 200 years ago. Positivism is sometimes presented as a caricature. The young Peter Berger, interested as always in theology, once wrote: ""In a world full of Nazis, one can be forgiven for being a Barthian"" (Berger, 1990/1967, p. 21). A more current version might be: ""In a world of fake news, one may be forgiven for being a Positivist"". We should not forget that Positivism emerged partly as a scientific antidote to Fascist ideologies of man in society. However, mainstream sociology today seems to find a way and at least muddle through between the old naïve positivism and a radical postmodernism, usually a bit closer to positivism than to postmodernism. My impression is that most sociologists today, including ociologists of religion, in their empirical research are some kinds of moderate constructionists or critical realists, although skipping the somewhat overformalized apparatus of critical realism in a narrow sense. In other words, most sociologists acknowledge that there is a reality out there, independent of their language and methodology, but also that this reality must be interpreted. Important for us here is that such interpretations are influenced by the researchers' background and horizon, hopefully also by empirical findings. But such findings must be made sense of, they must be interpreted. The background and horizon of the researcher consist of many elements, varying from paradigmatic frames in one's discipline, via institutional settings and funding possibilities, over to personal convictions, religious, political or others. My overview of such contexts here is highly incomplete, but I will touch upon a few examples. © 2019 Brill Academic Publishers.

Given differences between conservatives and liberals in threat sensitivity and dangerous-world beliefs, correlations between political orientation and negatively-biased credulity may thus reflect endogenous mindsets. Alternatively, such results may owe to the political hierarchy at the time of previous research, as the tendency to see dark forces at work is thought to be greater among those who are out of political power. Adjudicating between these accounts can inform how societies respond to the challenge of alarmist disinformation campaigns. We exploit the consequences of the 2016 U.S. elections to test these competing explanations of differences in negatively-biased credulity and conspiracism as a function of political orientation. Two studies of Americans reveal continued positive associations between conservatism, negatively-biased credulity, and conspiracism despite changes to the power structure in conservatives’ favor. © 2018 Samore et al.

Field experiments seem infeasible due to ethical issues. Survey experiments typically invoke strong assumptions about homogeneous treatment effects across subjects and settings. We argue that exploiting temporal overlap between rumor circulations and survey interviews can be a useful alternative. We focus on an accidental and sudden spread of ""Obama-is-a-Muslim"" myths in September 2008. Using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares over-time belief changes of those interviewed for the September wave of the 2008- 2009 American National Election Studies surveys before the rumor circulation and afterwards, we find that this event increased people's belief that Barack Obama is a Muslim by 4 to 8 percentage points.

The purpose of this paper is to examine it, what is being done in response to it, and specifically what libraries can do. Design/methodology/approach: Recent literature on the post-truth phenomenon was examined. Traditional assumptions about the role of libraries in promoting democracy were questioned and an alternative view was put forward. Libraries’ responses to the post-truth phenomenon were examined and critically discussed. Findings: Traditional assumptions about the role of libraries and information and democracy are outdated. The susceptibility of people to false beliefs and the persistence of these beliefs in spite of corrective information, is the product of many factors, including the evolving media ecosystem and psychosocial processes which are the subject of ongoing empirical research. It not primarily an information or knowledge deficit, hence there are no simple antidotes to fake news. Libraries need to rethink their responses. Research limitations/implications: The paper deals with very recent developments and relies heavily on informal online resources. Practical implications: Relevant library activities are examined and suggestions are made for developing appropriate library responses.

But how can we limit it and prevent it from destroying the truth? This question is particularly topical given the so-called ""post-truth"" phenomenon of fake news, conspiracy theories and populist propaganda. Arendt's analyses of the relationship between truth and lies in politics are helpful. To defend facticity, truth is indispensable, but factual truth resists limitless freedom of speech and action, or, in Arendt's words, our enlarged mentality. Imagination is the common ground for creativity, the design of another world, but also for lies. Therefore, politics and lies are structurally very close, though of course not the same. Contemporary populist movements use lies in order to undermine the credibility of other politicians and mass media. The boundaries between truth, lies, the denial of reality, invented truths as well as, for example, anti-Semitism and racism are dissolving. Conspiracy theories are the pinnacle of the loss of reality. In contrast to lies, they offer a closed parallel world in which nothing happens by accident and nothing is what it seems. Zygmunt Bauman's term retrotopia indicates that globalization and technological change are leading to growing uncertainty and a discrediting of policies, which meet with populist aims. Arendt's republicanism offers an alternative to both, populism and consumer liberalism: the defense of facts, enlightened criticism and a concept of a qualitative plurality of engaged citizens. © Wolfgang Heuer, 2018.; Ложь сопровождает нас, она паразитирует на истине и является неотъемлемой частью нашей повседневной жизни. Но как мы можем ограничить ложь и предотвратить разрушение правды? Этот вопрос особенно актуален в связи с новым феноменом так называемой «постправды» с его фейковыми новостями, теориями заговора и популистской пропагандой. Здесь может оказаться полезным обращение к арендтовскому анализу отношений между правдой и ложью в политике. Для защиты достоверности необходима истина, но в то же время фактическая истина противостоит безграничной свободе слова и действий, или, говоря словами Арендт, нашему широкому образу мысли. Воображение - это общая основа для творчества, мысленного построения другого мира, но также и для лжи. Таким образом, политика и ложь структурно очень близки, хотя, конечно, не одно и то же. Современные популистские движения используют ложь, чтобы подорвать доверие к политикам и средствам массовой информации. Границы между правдой, ложью, отрицанием реальности, выдуманными истинами, а также антисемитизмом и расизмом стираются. В конспирологических теориях потеря чувства реальности достигает своего апофеоза. В отличие от лжи, они предлагают закрытый параллельный мир, в котором ничего не происходит случайно и ничто не является тем, чем кажется. Термин Зигмунта Баумана «ретротопия» указывает на то, что глобализация и технологические изменения приводят к растущему уровню неопределенности и дискредитации политики, что отвечает популистским целям. Республиканизм Арендт предлагает альтернативу популизму и потребительскому либерализму: защиту фактов, просвещенный критицизм и концепцию качественной множественности вовлеченных граждан.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064599072"

However, credulity entails risks. The optimal level of credulity depends on the relative costs of believing misinformation and failing to attend to accurate information. When information concerns hazards, erroneous incredulity is often more costly than erroneous credulity, given that disregarding accurate warnings is more harmful than adopting unnecessary precautions. Because no equivalent asymmetry exists for information concerning benefits, people should generally be more credulous of hazard information than of benefit information. This adaptive negatively biased credulity is linked to negativity bias in general and is more prominent among people who believe the world to be more dangerous. Because both threat sensitivity and beliefs about the dangerousness of the world differ between conservatives and liberals, we predicted that conservatism would positively correlate with negatively biased credulity.

The preponderance of such representations revolved around the Iranian nation's identification as a Shi'i Muslim-majority polity. As such, the Revolution's trajectory and its landmark events - such as the 1979 hostage crisis -were often construed in light of this fact. Prominent among literary representations of post-revolutionary Iran in western literature are V. S. Naipaul's 'Islamic' travelogues, Among the Believers (1981) and Beyond Belief (1998). This paper critiques Naipaul's representations of Iran and Shi'i Islam in the two travel narratives, highlighting some of the most popular instances of myth and disinformation that the texts propagate. Thematic critique of the narratives is intended to shed light on the author's Orientalist approach and his engagement in ahistoncal histoncism, which - coupled with a conspicuous ignorance of Iran, Islam, and Shi'ism - has resulted in two of the most notorious literary tirades on Islam and the Muslim World. © 2016 The Islamic College.

Since little is known about young children in the context of media education, this paper fills a research gap by studying the media awareness and use of upper primary students. A questionnaire on media awareness and media use patterns was given to the teachers, who were asked to answer the questions from the perspective of their students. The same questionnaire was administered to students during class time. The descriptive statistics of the data were analyzed and compared. Students believed that the most reliable media for providing news was the television, followed by the radio, the newspaper, and the Internet; about half of the students believed that they were capable of distinguishing true from false news; students were more proactive media users than the teachers thought. The findings of this study suggest that more contextual and in-depth approaches to research would be beneficial to assess the media use patterns of students, from which relevant media education models can be derived. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957883636"

As many testimonies involve traumatic, as opposed to neutral, events, it is important to consider the role of distress in susceptibility to false memories. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cortisol response following a stressor would be associated with susceptibility to false memories. Psychological distress responses were also investigated, specifically, dissociation, intrusions, and avoidance. Participants were allocated to one of three conditions: those who viewed a neutral film (N = 35), those who viewed a real trauma film (N = 35), and a trauma “reappraisal” group where participants were told the film was not real (N = 35). All received misinformation about the film in the form of a narrative. Participants provided saliva samples (to assess cortisol) and completed distress and memory questionnaires. Cortisol response was a significant predictor of the misinformation effect. Dissociation and avoidance were related to confabulations. In conclusion, following a stressor an individual may differ with regard to their psychological response to the event, and also whether they experience a cortisol increase. This may affect whether they are more distressed later on, and also whether they remember the event accurately. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945151918"

With analyses of modern mass media as a backdrop, I propose a return to the foundational work of Michel Foucault on the (re)configuration of processes of knowledge production and governmentality to explore ways in which sociologists may deduce new claims from an increasingly diverse and complex public sphere. I argue that sociologists have novel tools at their disposal to enable the production of systematic knowledge and to combat growing trepidation to “truth” claims currently proliferating governmental and media discourse. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one’s prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education.

Doing so will allow for a more comprehensive and informed dialogue about how to address sexual assault on university campuses.

The study shows that the GMO discourse was built with the rhetorical frames of smallholder farmer vulnerability and entitlement used in the account it contradicts, thereby legitimating its own appeal for responsive remedies. Civil society claims attacked GMOs as discriminatory and as an environmental and human health risk. Government and scientists engaged in unsympathetic counter rhetorical strategies in hopes of debunking or neutralizing the claim made by civil society. In other words, Government and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory and posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of insincerity, claiming that scientists had some kind of “hidden agenda” behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from their patents on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs includes the underlying assumptions, the uncertainties and the probabilities associated with both best and worst case scenarios. This is a necessary condition to minimise misinformation on GMOs but may be insufficient to completely erase conspiracy theories from the minds of the public especially when scientists and government are perceived to be biased towards multinational corporations that are ostensibly preoccupied with making profits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962267155"

In particular, feeling a lack of control may make people more vulnerable to these misperceptions—a claim we test in a preregistered survey experiment examining beliefs about the Palestinian exodus during the creation of the state of Israel. Consistent with expectations, Jewish Israelis who were asked to recall an event in which they lacked control were more vulnerable to arguments (incorrectly) denying any Jewish responsibility for the exodus. By contrast, corrective information successfully reduced misperceptions regardless of feelings of control.

HPV vaccination paired with adequate knowledge about HPV infection provides the best protection against cervical cancer. To identify the level of knowledge and the health beliefs towards HPV and the HPV vaccine among HPV-vaccinated female students in Malaysia. A nationwide cross-sectional survey among 14 years old female students who had received three doses of the HPV vaccine was conducted in 32 randomly selected schools from 13 states and 3 federal territories in Malaysia between February 2013 and April 2013. Among 2482 respondents, knowledge about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score was only 3.56 (SD ± 1.76), out of a possible score of 10. The majority of respondents were unaware that vaccinating boys with HPV can help protect girls against HPV infection (91.6%), HPV cannot be cured(81.6%) and that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (70.3%). Most of the respondents had the misconception that only females get HPV (95.1%), and that the HPV vaccine eliminates the need for Pap smear tests (68.3%). Most respondents (91.6%) believed that they would not get an HPV infection. Almost half of the respondents (42.9%) held the misconception that HPV infection could not lead to serious illness. Findings revealed poor knowledge about both HPV and the HPV vaccine, low perceived susceptibility to HPV infection and misinformation about HPV infection among HPV-vaccinated girls. Therefore, it is essential to increase the knowledge and awareness of health risks regarding HPV infection among teenaged girls who have received the HPV vaccine. © 2016 Wong et al.

In times of misinformation, oversimplified answers to complex problems and populist agitators, critical thinking remains a vital skill, necessary to differentiate accurate information from manipulation. Although students should learn how to use digital media critically to not fall prey to false information, hasty actions or to the dominance of the smart devices, digital technologies can also be very supportive to foster critical thinking. Therefore, they must be imbedded discreetly in teaching and learning environments in a way that they become supportive for the different activities of the critical thinking process. In this paper, we would like to unroll some ideas indicating how this could be done in higher education contexts. Fostering critical thinking demands quite a lot from teachers and students. Students, for example, must conceptualize and exercise different thinking modes, jettison dear beliefs and create new and substantial ways of thinking and acting. Teachers however need to get a very clear idea of what critical thinking means in their field. They must be able to model critical thinking, its criteria or strategies. Furthermore, they need to know and apply different instructional strategies that are helpful to bring students into the different activities of critical thinking. To broaden the perspective on concepts, we will discuss different definitions and traditions of critical thinking and offer a synthesis. In the next step, we will examine process-models of critical thinking and introduce educational strategies and design-principles. A further chapter is dedicated to digital media and critical thinking. We will have a focus on why students should critically think about media. From there, we will go back to general strategies and design principles for fostering CT and show how digital media could be practically used in accordance with these principles. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2018.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042472932"

This phenomenon is often referred to as the continued influence effect of misinformation. The repetition of the original misconception within a retraction could contribute to this phenomenon, as it could inadvertently make the ""myth"" more familiar-and familiar information is more likely to be accepted as true. From a dual-process perspective, familiarity-based acceptance of myths is most likely to occur in the absence of strategic memory processes. Thus, we examined factors known to affect whether strategic memory processes can be utilized: age, detail, and time. Participants rated their belief in various statements of unclear veracity, and facts were subsequently affirmed and myths were retracted. Participants then rerated their belief either immediately or after a delay. We compared groups of young and older participants, and we manipulated the amount of detail presented in the affirmative or corrective explanations, as well as the retention interval between encoding and a retrieval attempt. We found that (a) older adults over the age of 65 were worse at sustaining their postcorrection belief that myths were inaccurate, (b) a greater level of explanatory detail promoted more sustained belief change, and (c) fact affirmations promoted more sustained belief change in comparison with myth retractions over the course of 1 week (but not over 3 weeks), This supports the notion that familiarity is indeed a driver of continued influence effects. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038082411"

But who can reporters trust? In a post-truth, fake-news era, this paper explores how student reporters in Singapore verify the credibility of online newsmakers. The study has three areas of enquiry. Firstly, how do they utilise social media to find newsmakers? Secondly, as one benefit of the internet is that it offers access to diverse voices, how do they verify non-elite newsmakers’ identities? Finally, how do they negotiate credibility online in a post-truth world? This study draws on interview data between 2010 and 2016 to observe changes over time. Findings suggest that the next generation of reporters “stalk” non-elite newsmakers on social media to verify their identity. They have a greater flexibility of what constitutes “truth” and are more accepting of truth as relative. Thus, they prefer to use multiple news sources and viewpoints. They also viewed the social aspect of social media as a marker of credibility as they preferred to access newsmakers who showed one degree of separation from their own network. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031100128"

As such, the media handling of information concerning EU immigration during pre-Brexit campaigning provides a compelling illustration of the systematic violation of epistemic rights. In this paper, I outline the nature of epistemic rights and epistemic rights violations and demonstrate the widespread perpetration of such violations in pre-Brexit media coverage.

The misinformation effect occurs when the recollection of an event changes because new, misleading information about the event is received. The purpose of this study was to merge the choice blindness and misinformation effect paradigms, and thus examine whether choice blindness can be created for individuals' recollections of a witnessed event, and whether this will affect their later recollections of the event. Thus, as a way of delivering misinformation the participants ostensibly became their own source of the misleading information. The participants watched a short film and filled out a questionnaire about events shown in the film. Some of their answers were then manipulated using reattachable stickers, which allowed alteration of their original answers. The participants gave justifications for their manipulated choices, and later their recollection of the original event was tested through another questionnaire. Choice blindness was created for a majority of the participants. A majority of the choice blind participants later changed their reported recollection of the event in line with the manipulations, whereas only a small minority of the participants in the control condition changed their recollection. This study provides new information about the misinformation effect, suggesting that this effect also can occur when misinformation is given immediately following presentation of the original stimuli, and about choice blindness and its effects on the recollections of events. The results suggest that memory blindness can be created when people inadvertently supply themselves with misleading information about an event, causing a change in their recollection. © 2017 Stille et al.

This study presumes some personal factors like bias and involvement are mediating factors that affect social networking activities. Firstly the research outcome showed that fake news readers didn’t have full confidence in fake news that was composed of same subject and different point of view with factually based news (reliability of factually based news: M=2.99, reliability of fake new: M=2.45). Secondly, the respondents were influenced by confirmation bias independent of the type of news they were shown. A significant difference (t=5.76, df=241, P<0.001) of confirmation bias between factually based news (M=2.84, SD=0.58) and fake news (M=2.42, SD=0.54) was presented. Thirdly both news audiences demonstrated value relevant involvement (value relevant involvement of factually based news: M=2.90, SD=0.68, values relevant involvement of fake news: M=2.62, SD=0.66). Factually based news is higher than fake news on value relevant involvement and the difference is significant (t=3.24 df=241, P<0.01). However, issue-relevant involvement doesn’t relate with either news type (real news: M=3.68, SD=0.75, fake news: M=3.55 SD=0.70). The social networking activities of real news audience (M=2.57, SD=0.87) is little higher than fake news (M=2.33, SD=0.75). Fourthly, this paper uses the regression analysis on the correlation between the type of news they watch (fake news or factually based news) and news consumer’s social networking activities through mediating variables such as confirmation bias and involvement (value relevant involvement and issue relevant involvement). It showed that those exposed to factually based news were mediated by confirmation bias and value relevant involvement (F=22.432, df=118, p<.001) under 34.7% explanation power of social networking activities, and those exposed to fake news were mediated by confirmation bias (F=11.255, df=117, p<.001) under 20.4% explanation power of social networking activities. The implications of this study are as follows; users are not motivated to do social networking activities on news based on its factual content. Depending on the user’s interest of news agenda, user is reliable of the news. News users don’t have blind faith in fake news. Regardless of the factuality of news and the personal importance of an issue, users are influenced by bias and value and beliefs to do social networking activities (clicking like, posting, and sharing). Social networking activities are mediated by confirmation bias and value relevant involvement on the both news types. For the implication of news literacy, the result of research shows that news users need to develop critical thinking skills to evaluate evidence fairly and objectively. To reduce confirmation bias, one needs to reduce the psychological defense reaction and seek an emotional change. Value Relevant Involvement is also a defense mechanism to keep one’s opinion. Confirmation bias and Value relevant involvement are personal factors that disrupt one’s objective attitude for accepting news. It is important to help users fairly understand the news through educational tools such as debate, cooperative work and role playing games. These kinds of educational tools help users avoid misinterpretation, develop strength of interaction and acquire various samples for decision making. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057648220"

Results from two preregistered experiments indicate that conspiracy beliefs were higher when people were exposed to seemingly redacted documents compared to when they were exposed to unredacted documents that were otherwise identical. In addition, unredacted documents consistently lowered conspiracy beliefs relative to controls while redacted documents had reduced or null effects, suggesting that lay epistemic interpretations of the redactions undermined the effect of information in the documents.

Climate change can be expected to catalyse the susceptibility to flooding through extreme weather events, sea level rise (SLR) and other climate related pressures. Further, population growth in coastal proximity can exacerbate vulnerabilities by degrading ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs that island communities tend to rely on for protection. The net effect: More and more people are congregating in a high-risk zone for floods and storms, but are less and less protected from them. Conventional adaptation wisdom suggests three responses: (1) plan a managed retreat (e.g., move inland); (2) accommodate the changes (e.g., build stilt houses); (3) resist the intrusion (e.g., build sea walls). On the Carteret Islands of Bougainville/Papua New Guinea (PNG), also known as the Tulun or Kilinailau Atoll, none of these adaptation measures have so far enabled the islanders to adapt in situ to mounting people and sea level pressures, resulting in both ad hoc and planned out-migration responses. Drawing on pilot research conducted on the Tulun and Nissan Atolls of Bougainville/PNG, this paper examines the linkages between climate change and human movement. It extends previous research by expressly inviting the grassroots perspectives of atoll communities of origin and mainland communities of destination in Tinputz and Buka. The research develops recommendations in areas of education, livelihood security, government planning and countering misinformation. Experiences and lessons gathered in this paper will be useful for both policy and practice serving the cause of climate change adaptation in Pacific island communities. Working towards a better understanding of climate change related vulnerabilities in coastal areas will also enable better adaptation responses. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063046899"

The paper develops the matrix using current events, identifies prevailing societal themes and generates hypotheses about global dynamics. Themes include examining increases in splitting, migration and tribalism, loss of trust in parliamentary democracy and the growth of presidential power, the maternal and paternal political environments, free speech, virtual reality, fake news and political correctness and the more negative impact of the internet. Three hypotheses are offered to try and understand current events: a) pressure on national and other boundaries; b) escaping from not knowing; and c) escaping from honest conversations because of the impact of guilt and shame.

This paper will explore original research conducted by Walton and Hepworth and how it has developed over the last 10 years – the pilot study was reported in the very first edition of this journal in 2007. It will show that it has led to the emergence of the concept of information discernment and how Foucault’s discourse analysis theory has been used to further critically analyse its application. This paper will show how the research has been applied in a range of contexts, from enabling students in their first year of A-level study in the UK to carry out better research for their extended project qualification (EPQ), to teaching information literacy to undergraduates in various disciplines. This research will then be synthesised to create a new theory of information discernment summarised as: the ways in which social, psychological, behavioural and information source factors influence peoples’ judgements about information. I argue that information discernment should be included in future notions of information literacy and, in particular, informs the ACRL (2016) key threshold concept that authority is constructed and contextual. Attendant psychological notions of worldview, misinformation, confirmation bias, motivated reasoning and epistemic beliefs will be explored to determine how these articulate and enrich this new theory. The paper explores how this theory can be applied in practice beyond the learning environment, and argues that, ultimately, information literacy is a subversive activity which challenges received notions of the construction, communication and exchange of information and knowledge. © 2017, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

As a genuinely transnational professional movement which includes practitioners from multiple journalistic cultures as well as other fields, fact-checking offers a new site to consider whether and how professional journalism is meaningfully becoming globalized. This paper models a novel approach to mapping a diverse organizational landscape in terms of institutional ties to the fields of journalism, academia, and politics. Drawing on fieldwork from two international gatherings of fact-checkers, I array fact-checking outlets on a ternary graph and review their competing understandings of the mission, the target, and the practices of fact-checking. I highlight areas of convergence as well as divergence in this organizational milieu, focusing particular attention on boundaries not drawn—the willingness of professional journalists in this global movement to share jurisdictional authority with non-journalists.

This paper seeks to shed light on some of the better and lesser well-known myths which surround sexuality and Judaism. The initial concentration is on a representative view of sexuality, intimacy and related gender expectations as discussed in traditional Jewish sources such as the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash. We then examine a number of myths which have become part of the legends surrounding Jewish sexuality, and look at the origins, where available, of this ""common wisdom"" and provide source material supporting more accurate information. While this paper focuses on the stigma and preconceived notions regarding Jewish sexuality, our point has application whenever we as sexual health professionals are called upon to educate or practice in the value-laden realm of human intimacy. © Stephen Hunt 2010.

From a qualitative and quantitative approach, this research compares the work methodology and the evaluation models presented by the digital platforms, as well as the topics and actors that are subject to examination. The study highlights the aim of these projects, independent of traditional media, to evaluate statements on the most relevant issues of the sociopolitical agenda of their countries and public representatives. The importance of these platforms is reflected in the fact that only two in ten checks from the sample can be considered true, almost half of those identified as false and of those presenting some kind of inaccuracy.

In Experiment 1, we examined the use of recollection rejection to reject contradictory and additive misinformation. We measured recollection rejection by comparing misinformation acceptance rates, graphing confidence-accuracy data using phantom receiver operating characteristic curves, examining high confidence rejections of misinformation, and examining self-report responses. These measures converged on the finding that participants used recollection rejection to reject both types of misinformation but used recollection rejection more on contradictory misinformation. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the delay between the event and misinformation and between misinformation and test. The length of both of these delays affected misinformation acceptance. Participants were more likely to use recollection rejection to reject contradictory misinformation after a short delay before encountering misinformation. Overall these findings indicate that people can spontaneously induce recollection rejection to reject misinformation and prevent false memories. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one's own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants' analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change. It also highlights how political expressions can be both stable in the context of everyday life, yet flexible when argumentative processes are engaged. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058376964"

The influence of these social interactions on the veracity of emotional memories has rarely been investigated. The authors (Choi, Kensinger, & Rajaram Memory and Cognition, 41, 403–415, 2013) previously demonstrated that when the categorical relatedness of information is controlled, emotional items are more accurately remembered than neutral items. The present study examined whether emotion would continue to improve the accuracy of memory when individuals discussed the emotional and neutral events with others. Two different paradigms involving social influences were used to investigate this question and compare evidence. In both paradigms, participants studied stimuli that were grouped into conceptual categories of positive (e.g., celebration), negative (e.g., funeral), or neutral (e.g., astronomy) valence. After a 48-hour delay, recognition memory was tested for studied items and categorically related lures. In the first paradigm, recognition accuracy was compared when memory was tested individually or in a collaborative triad. In the second paradigm, recognition accuracy was compared when a prior retrieval session had occurred individually or with a confederate who supplied categorically related lures. In both of these paradigms, emotional stimuli were remembered more accurately than were neutral stimuli, and this pattern was preserved when social interaction occurred. In fact, in the first paradigm, there was a trend for collaboration to increase the beneficial effect of emotion on memory accuracy, and in the second paradigm, emotional lures were significantly less susceptible to the “social contagion” effect. Together, these results demonstrate that emotional memories can be more accurate than nonemotional ones even when events are discussed with others (Experiment 1) and even when that discussion introduces misinformation (Experiment 2). © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959103009"

Sleep is important for memory, but voluntary sleep curtailment is becoming more rampant. Here, the misinformation paradigm was used to investigate false memory formation after 1 night of total sleep deprivation in healthy young adults (N = 58, mean age ± SD = 22.10 ± 1.60 years; 29 males), and 7 nights of partial sleep deprivation (5 h sleep opportunity) in these young adults and healthy adolescents (N = 54, mean age ± SD = 16.67 ± 1.03 years; 25 males). In both age groups, sleep-deprived individuals were more likely than well-rested persons to incorporate misleading post-event information into their responses during memory retrieval (P < 0.050). These findings reiterate the importance of adequate sleep in optimal cognitive functioning, reveal the vulnerability of adolescents' memory during sleep curtailment, and suggest the need to assess eyewitnesses' sleep history after encountering misleading information. © 2016 The Authors.

This study seeks to ex-amine individual level antecedents of information re-sharing behavior including individual beliefs about the quality of information available on social network sites (SNSs), attitude towards SNS use and risk perceptions and attitudes. Methodology Testing the research model by data collected through surveys that were adminis-tered to test the research model. Data was collected from undergraduate students in a public university in the US. Contribution This study contributes to theory in Information Systems by addressing the issue of information quality in the context of information re-sharing on social media. This study has important practical implications for SNS users and providers alike. Ensuring that information available on SNS is of high quality is critical to main-taining a healthy user base. Findings Results indicate that attitude toward using SNSs and intention to re-share infor-mation on SNSs is influenced by perceived information quality (enjoyment, rele-vance, and reliability). Also, risk-taking propensity and enjoyment influence the intention to re-share information on SNSs in a positive direction. Future Research In the dynamic context of SNSs, the role played by quality of information is changing. Understanding changes in quality of information by conducting longi-tudinal studies and experiments and including the role of habits is necessary.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035779243"

This finding is particularly worrisome in politics where misinformation is regularly distributed about political candidates. We examined whether initial inferences about a fictional political candidate could be corrected, and whether people's willingness to accept a correction was influenced by the valence of the information being corrected. Participants read a list of statements describing a politician running for re-election in which a negative, positive or neutral piece of information about the politician was later corrected. Results showed that receiving a correction reduced reliance on the original information for all types of information: positive, negative and neutral.

Unfortunately, online communities often become vehicles for promotion of pernicious misinformation, in particular, that HIV virus is a myth (AIDS denialism). This study seeks to explore online users’ behavior and interactions within AIDS-denialist community to identify and estimate the number of those, who potentially are most susceptible to AIDS-denialist arguments—“the risk group” in terms of becoming AIDS denialists. Social network analysis was used for examining the most numerous AIDS-denialist community (over 15,000 members) in the most popular Russian SNS “VK.com.” In addition, content analysis was used for collecting data on attitudes toward AIDS-denialist arguments and participants’ self-disclosed HIV status. Two data sets were collected to analyze friendship ties and communication interactions among community members. We have identified the core of online community—cohesive and dedicated AIDS denialists, and the risk group: users who communicate with core members, and, thus, can be more susceptible to the AIDS-denialist propaganda and their health behaviors (e.g., refusing treatment). Analysis allowed to significantly reduce the target audience for possible intervention campaigns and simultaneously increase the accuracy of determining the risk group composition. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027418372"

The Russian government’s narrative has prompted western concern due to fears that it exerts a destabilizing effect on societies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. However, the behavior and thought processes of news consumers targeted by contradictory strategic narratives are rarely subjected to analysis. This paper examines how Ukrainian news consumers decide where to get their news and what to believe in a media environment where “propaganda” and “disinformation” are regarded as major threats to national security. Evidence comes from thirty audio-diaries and in-depth interviews conducted in 2016 among adult residents of Odesa Region. Through qualitative analysis of the diary and interview transcripts, the paper reveals how participants judged the credibility of news and narratives based on their priorities (what they considered important), not just “facts” (what they believed had happened).

We investigated the hypothesis that collegiate football players are more proficient than their non-athlete counterparts at controlling impulsive motor actions. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I football players (n = 280) and non-athlete controls (n = 32) completed a variant of the Simon conflict task, which quantifies choice reaction speed and the proficiency of controlling spatially driven response impulses. Overall, the choice reaction times (RTs) and accuracy rates of football players and controls were equivalent. Similarly, football players and controls were equally susceptible to producing incorrect impulsive motor responses. However, the slowing of RT attributed to the activation and successful inhibition of these impulses (i.e., the Simon effect) was reduced significantly among football players compared to controls. Moreover, differences in impulse control varied by position among the players, with the reduction being greater for offensive than for defensive players. Among offensive players, running backs, wide receivers, and offensive linemen had greater impulse control than did controls, whereas among defensive players only linebackers had greater control. Notably, the Simon effect was reduced by 60% in running backs compared to controls. These results contribute to emerging evidence that elite football players possess more proficient executive control over their motor systems than their age counterparts and suggest that the speed of controlling impulsive motor reactions may represent an enhanced cognitive ""intangible"" among football players. © 2018 Bashore, Ally, van Wouwe, Neimat, van den Wildenberg and Wylie.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052223483"

Because such high stakes are at play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which has limited their success and generality. In this work, we propose a model that combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news. Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not. Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations of both users and articles. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037361396"

In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one's own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants' analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change. It also highlights how political expressions can be both stable in the context of everyday life, yet flexible when argumentative processes are engaged. © 2018 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053521964"

Deep within the act is a controversial provision called the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act (CFPDA), which establishes a Global Engagement Center under the State Department and consolidates the power of several federal broadcasting entities under one authority. This center will coordinate efforts to counter foreign propaganda, mainly from Russia and China, that is aimed at undermining the United States’ national security interests. The consolidation of power creates some concerns regarding journalistic independence and credibility for media outlets such as the Voice of America. The new Trump administration’s perceived amicable relationship with Russia also generates uncertainty around the commitment to fight Russian disinformation and propaganda. This essay argues that the US does in fact need some kind of governmental entity devoted to the creation of counter-propaganda, and then concludes there are deficiencies and vulnerabilities with the CFPDA, especially a lack of adequate administrative oversight. Based on this conclusion, as well as on lessons gleaned from how other nations have dealt with Russian disinformation campaigns, the essay offers tentative recommendations as to what an effective governing structure would look like. © 2017 National Communication Association.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023757266"

In many cases, this disinformation is associated with the efforts of movements and parties on the radical right to mobilize supporters against centre parties and the mainstream press that carries their messages. The spread of disinformation can be traced to growing legitimacy problems in many democracies. Declining citizen confidence in institutions undermines the credibility of official information in the news and opens publics to alternative information sources. Those sources are often associated with both nationalist (primarily radical right) and foreign (commonly Russian) strategies to undermine institutional legitimacy and destabilize centre parties, governments and elections. The Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump in the United States are among the most prominent examples of disinformation campaigns intended to disrupt normal democratic order, but many other nations display signs of disinformation and democratic disruption.

With an experimental procedure embedded in two surveys about Chinese internet users' information exposure, this study finds that rumors decrease citizens' trust in the government and support of the regime. Moreover, individuals from diverse socio-economic and political backgrounds are similarly susceptible to thinly evidenced rumors. Rebuttals generally reduce people's belief in the specific content of rumors, but often do not recover political trust unless the government brings forth solid and vivid evidence to back its refutation or win the endorsement of public figures broadly perceived to be independent. But because such high-quality and strong rebuttals are hard to come by, rumors will Erode political support in an authoritarian state.

However, misconceptions abound, symptoms are often overlooked, and diagnosis frequently occurs in advanced stages. As one step to addressing these issues, this research explores the social construction of ovarian cancer in women’s magazines to identify the ideas and discourses surrounding this illness and interpret their explicit and implicit meanings. A constructivist discourse analytic approach guided analysis of 62 print and online articles from 8 women’s magazines available in Canada over a 20-year period. Analysis resulted in identification of three discourses pertaining to: self-responsibility for health, ovarian cancer as uncertain and inevitably fatal, and ovarian cancer as a heroic endeavour. Critical interpretation highlights misinformation, contradictory beliefs, and unrealistic expectations surrounding this illness, which have implications for healthy and affected women. The findings emphasise the importance of identifying and challenging these discursive constructions to expose inconsistencies, minimise harm to women’s well-being, and promote authentic portrayals of ovarian cancer. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030532091"

Specifically, it examined the impact of source credibility on the assessment of veracity when information comes from a polarizing source (Experiment 1), and effectiveness of explanations when they come from one’s own political party or an opposition party (Experiment 2). These experiments were conducted prior to the 2016 Presidential election. Participants rated their belief in factual and incorrect statements that President Trump made on the campaign trail; facts were subsequently affirmed and misinformation retracted. Participants then re-rated their belief immediately or after a delay. Experiment 1 found that (i) if information was attributed to Trump, Republican supporters of Trump believed it more than if it was presented without attribution, whereas the opposite was true for Democrats and (ii) although Trump supporters reduced their belief in misinformation items following a correction, they did not change their voting preferences. Experiment 2 revealed that the explanation’s source had relatively little impact, and belief updating was more influenced by perceived credibility of the individual initially purporting the information. These findings suggest that people use political figures as a heuristic to guide evaluation of what is true or false, yet do not necessarily insist on veracity as a prerequisite for supporting political candidates. © 2017 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014613479"

This paper argues that as Western democracies experience conditions that echo Arendt's twentieth century assessment - among these are the death of truth, the decline of civility, and the dearth of authenticity in the public sphere - Arendt's work helps us better understand two sources of this modern crisis. First is the blurring of truth and opinion in contemporary political discourse; second is the blurring of the public and private realms made possible by the coercive intermediation of the social. An acute danger of these circumstances is the lure of demagogues and extreme ideologies when the words and deeds of the public realm - either because they are not believed, or because they have been reduced to mere image-making - increasingly lack meaning, integrity, and spontaneity. A second danger is the erosion of faith in the free press (and with it our common world and basic facts) when the press itself, reacting to its own sense of darkness, undermines its role of truthteller by assuming the role of political actor. In the end I suggest that underlying these several acute issues of democracy lies a more basic tension in the public sphere centered on an Arendtian notion of ""freedom of opinion"". © John LeJeune, 2018.; Ханна Арендт однажды так охарактеризовала «темные времена»: «кризис доверия» и «закулисное правительство» - это выражения, не раскрывающие, а затемняющие суть происходящего, это моральные призывы, которые под предлогом защиты любую истину низводят до бессмысленного трюизма. Опыт западных демократий созвучен оценкам Арендт в отношении ХХ столетия, в частности, она указывала на смерть истины, упадок гражданственности, утрату аутентичности в публичной сфере, а следовательно, ее работы позволяют лучше понять два источника современного кризиса. Первый - стирание границ между истиной и мнением в современном политическом дискурсе. Второй - размывание границ между публичной и частной сферами, случившееся из-за насильственного вмешательства социального. Критическая опасность этих обстоятельств состоит в том, что они приводят к расцвету популистских и радикальных идеологий, в которых слова и поступки в публичной сфере - либо в силу того, что в них не верят, либо в силу того, что они сводятся к cозданию имиджа - лишены смысла, целостности и спонтанности. Вторая опасность заключается в разрушении веры в свободную прессу (и вместе с этим в наличие общего для всех нас мира и достоверные факты), когда средства массовой информации, опираясь на собственное понимание «тьмы», нивелируют свою роль в качестве распространителя истины и берут на себя роль политического субъекта. В статье высказывается предположение, что в основе указанных опасностей для демократии лежит более фундаментальная напряженность в публичной сфере, связанная с понятием «свободы мнения» Ханны Арендт.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064616367"

Overall, a misinformation effect was found for both items. The warning strongly reduced the misinformation effect, but only for the central item. In contrast, reports of the peripheral misinformation were correctly attributed to the misinformation source or, at least, ascribed to guesswork much more often than the central ones. As a consequence, after the SM task, the initially higher error rate for the peripheral item was even lower than that of the central item.

Participants completed the DRM (with negative and neutral word lists) and viewed a distressing or neutral film. Misinformation for the film was introduced and memory was assessed. Film accuracy and misinformation susceptibility were found to be greater for those who viewed the distressing film relative to the neutral film.

The majority of the Latvian population also condemns the physical abuse of women; however, the Istanbul Convention which deals with this matter was not ratified here. A number of factors were at play, the most significant of which was pressure exerted through the direct influence of a campaign that had been organised by opponents of the broadest understanding of human rights. Such pressure was exerted on decision makers (MPs and political parties), with indirect impact on the population via social media and the news media outlets. Campaigns by interest groups which spread opposing views are not unusual in a democratic society; however, in this case there was no discussion between the opposing parties. The public domain was not open to an interaction of views and beliefs based on arguments and critical thinking, as the argument of the opponents rested entirely upon their beliefs, whereas the supporters of the convention relied upon valid proof.

These women are either in the process of becoming mothers, or have attained motherhood, with the help of the assisted reproductive technologies (ART) industry. In the mid-nineties, the fledgling ART industry sought to serve heterosexual couples in (preferably) long-term committed relationships that faced problems in conceiving naturally (Houston, 2004). A decade later, the profit seeking industry’s rapid embrace of “other mothers,” (single and lesbian women) is indicative of an evolving marketplace that is largely unregulated and may be selective of who it serves (Houston, 2004). The potential vulnerabilities of such a marketplace invite further exploration by consumer researchers. Research on motherhood indicates that this life-stage experience involves extensive transitional consumption as women undergo the physical and socio-cultural transformation into becoming mothers. Recent research on new mothers’ consumer experiences (Jennings and O’Malley, 2003; Prothero, 2002; Carrigan and Sczmigin, 2004; Thomsen and Sorensen, 2006; Banister and Hogg, 2006; Voice Group, 2010) challenge dominant theoretical assumptions that consumers are automatically motivated to make informed decisions to consume through transitory life-roles (Voice Group, 2010). In this research we seek to understand the lived experiences of SMCs as they attain motherhood through ART. The first phase of our study consisted of netnographic discourse analysis (Kozinets, 2010) of posts and blogs from select online communities of self-identified SMCs to understand and contextualize their consumption experiences in the ART marketplace. In the second phase of the study we recruited eighteen informants to participate in e-mail and Skype interviews (Ballantine and Creery, 2010). Since we aimed to understand overall consumer experiences in the ART marketplace, we included SMCs who traversed the entire gamut of the motherhood experience. We invited our participants to narrate their life-stories of how they initially decided to become a parent. Interview topics ranged from their reproductive background, romantic relationships, kin and social networks, careers and finances, and ideas about motherhood and family. SMCs exchanged surprisingly candid technical, financial, and medical information in their online discourses. Preliminary findings from data analysis through iterative readings conducted independently by the two authors revealed that many SMCs described receiving positive reception as prospective customers at the ART clinics. However, social exclusion and fear of disapproval from social and kin networks were prominent in these discussions as were signs of defiance and celebration of independent decisions within virtual SMC communities. Womens’ consumption experiences in the ART industry, which due to its position as unregulated and largely unaccountable to customers, has been known to differentially treat single women (straight or lesbian) and heterosexual, married couples (Houston, 2004). In addition, our data analysis include accounts of treatment misinformation, inadequate screening processes of sperm donors, and deliberate withholding of financial obligations indicate a discernible lack of consumer control in a life event fraught with emotional investment in the consumption process. Our findings show that conceiving through ART is the least desirable choice for all women irrespective of their single or married status. ‘Trying to make a baby’ through the conventional route of love, marriage and sex, is portrayed as a positive experience of welcoming a child into the world to a two parent loving family. It is a powerful narrative that is ingrained in the cultural fabric of most societies. ART is often the last, desperate effort to experience pregnancy and biological motherhood for many women (Hertz, 2006). Previous research has indicated that heterosexual couples who resort to ART due to infertility problems draw strength and support from each other as they experience the emotionally and physically strenuous journey to parenthood (Fischer, Otnes and Tuncay, 2007). SMCs on the other hand report loneliness as they contemplate becoming single mothers through ART with the added burden of secrecy for fear of disapproval and exclusion from social networks (Hertz, 2006). In conclusion, our research extends previous research on motherhood related consumer experiences (Fisher, Tuncay and Otnes, 2007; Houston, 2004) by developing a conceptual model that describes the transitional life-stage of SMCs and their interactions with the ART marketplace. The model outlines individual and collective resources of SMCs and other influences that contest and shape their experiences as ART consumers. The model illustrates how the advent of scientific technology, combined with fading boundaries of the digital and physical world of human social networks, influence evolving consumer experiences of women who choose to become mothers without the direct help of Mother Nature. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science.","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125080946"

Naipaul's second Islamic travelogue Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples (1998), which chronicles the author's excursions to the 4 non-Arab Muslim countries of Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, and Malaysia. This critique is presented, firstly, through problematizing the author's theorization on the theme of Muslim conversion- which, according to Naipaul, has bred nothing but neurosis and nihilism in Muslim societies-and then through analyzing representations of the post-Revolutionary Iran of the late 90s. We argue that Naipaul's representations fall within an Orientalist frame of reference in which Iran and its people are portrayed through various tropes of Othering in a narrative fraught with disinformation, exaggerations, and reductive treatment of complex sociopolitical phenomena. Finally, Naipaul's reasoning in formulating conversion coupled with his myopic approach undermine the authenticity of his representations, resulting in what Said (1998) has dubbed ""an intellectual catastrophe of the first order"" (p. 42). © 2017 Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042452010"

In Experiment 1, 202 undergraduates participated in a misinformation experiment and semiautobiographical tasks involving three measures of memory distortion (suggestion, imagination, emotion). We established high internal consistency in individual differences measures and statistically significant experimental effects where we would expect them (e.g., the misinformation effect). However, false memory production in one task did not predict false memories in other paradigms. In Experiment 2, 163 adults participated in a misinformation experiment, a false memory word list task (Deese-Roediger-McDermott), and semiautobiographical false news story tasks. Again we found no consistent predictive relationships among various false memories. In both studies, no individual differences predicted memory distortion susceptibility consistently across tasks and across experiments. At this time, false memory production in a given laboratory task does not appear to adequately predict false memories in other tasks, a finding with implications for using these tasks to predict memory distortion in real world situations. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046296426"

It also increased counterarguing against the subtext, but only among viewers less involved with the episode’s story. The epilogue decreased social distance for people with bipolar disorder and decreased their belief that bipolar disorder is not treatable. These findings speak to the utility of epilogues as a tool to both reinforce intended entertainment–education messages and to combat misinformation. This function is particularly useful for entertainment portrayals of stigmatized conditions, which are at greater risk of being misunderstood.

In fact, when an age brings to the foreground the tensions of truthfulness and falsehood, correct information and fake news, reality and fiction, genuineness and delusion, this testifies to the unpredictability and inscrutable nature of the confusion into which public communication has been entrained. The rapid development of new media and digital technologies is causing a far-reaching process of change, especially in the field of politics. In his book on “the post-truth era”, Ralph J. Keyes announced the advent of a “fib-friendly times”, in which “more lies than ever are being told” (Keyes 2004, 4). However, the considerations in this paper rest on a more cautious and critical approach. They support a viewpoint of pluriperspectivism. The new media have surely raised a challenge to contemporary communications. Political affairs are always about certain perspectives and contributions in the constant agon or contest of truth. There is no completely neutral and non-partisan claim to truth, as some philosophers and scientists aspired to represent. Because of its particular nature, the truth can be revealed only with controversy and effort, never without participation and beyond any perspectives. Nevertheless, neither does the truth decline nor do we enter an age of post-truth. Moreover, we can argue about the question which age tends more towards the lie and fake news. Politics is not in a more difficult state today than it has ever been, nor is it in a much simpler position in terms of truth. The truth remains for politics a supporting ground and a permanent benchmark for assessment. It can be discovered only in its pluri-perspective appearance. © 2018 Hratsko Filozofsko Drustvo (Croatian Philosophical Society).

How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform k-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network. © 2018 Shao et al.

Recent methodological and technological developments in the social sciences have begun to generate an impressive ability to predict human behavior, especially when combined with new innovations in marketing and computer science. Disturbingly, political campaigns and interest groups, especially in the US, appropriate this new knowledge to try to alter the beliefs and behaviors of voters. This development bodes ill for US democracy and other liberal democracies where the use of these techniques is likely to increase.

Specifically, our data suggest that amygdala modulation of hippocampal mnemonic representations, during the time of misleading social influence, is associated with reduced subsequent anterior-lateral prefrontal cortex activity that reflects correction.

Participants told both truthful and deceptive accounts of either illegal or immoral actions. In the truthful accounts, the participants described their own misdeeds honestly (true confessions). In the deceptive accounts, the participants also described their own misdeeds but attributed them to someone else (false accusations). In Study 1, guided (n = 32) and unguided (n = 32) raters evaluated 64 transcribed accounts (16 per rater). Only a few ARJS-STV-S criteria differed significantly between false and true accounts. In Study 2 (N = 29), guided raters evaluated the same transcripts using only the most promising criteria of Study 1. Judgments in Study 2 were less biased (in terms of signal detection theory), and the classification of deceptive accounts was significantly better compared with a no-guidance control group and the guided group of Study 1. A Brunswikian lens model analysis showed that with the smaller set of cues there is a better correspondence between the ecological validities and the subjective utilities, which may explain the higher accuracy rates. When the criteria have little or no diagnostic value, or when true and false stories are very similar, providing raters with a larger set of truth criteria does not increase accuracy but instead may bias raters toward making truth judgments.

Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out using a survey research design. Qualitative reports of experiences in school were obtained using open-ended questionnaires. Findings: The reports were examined for themes regarding specific types of experiences and for types of inaccuracies taught about Arab culture in schools. Categories that arose for experiences included bullying/harassment, racial stereotyping and religious stereotyping of Arabs. Half of the sample reported that the culture is not represented in the multicultural paradigm in their school. Themes arising from curricular inaccuracies include misinformation involving stereotypes and biases. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include generalizability due to research design and sampling methods. Future research may use multiple methods of collecting this type of information, such as focus groups, observations and face-to-face interviews with participants. Practical implications: These experiences may affect students’ sense of belonging and inclusion in their schools, which may affect academic and social growth. Strategies for school staff to implement in their schools are provided. Results may be used to inform environmental, policy and curricular reform in schools.

At such times, policymakers must rely on scientific opinion. This is the case with many aspects of current climate policy, especially those involving untested but potentially necessary adaptations to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Unfortunately, scientific opinion is not currently defined, measured, or used in a standardized way, which often allows for the accidental or intentional dissemination of misinformation and the marginalization of science where science could be most beneficial. In this article, we argue that scientific opinion can be usefully measured by systematic surveys of scientists that employ standards similar to those that govern public opinion surveys, including systematic decisions about target populations, sampling frames, and sampling techniques. We demonstrate this approach with the methodology for a study of scientific opinion on a potential adaptation to climate change, the managed relocation of species. We show that survey results may be used to corroborate other types of information, refine or contradict other information, and offer novel insights into emerging issues, such as adaptations to climate change, that are currently not addressed with any other type of available information. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927582357"

The results indicated similar accuracy, proportions of misinformation endorsement and repeated susceptibility classification as shown in other multiple event misinformation studies. Eight items reliably produced the misinformation effect. Misinformation susceptible individuals had a lack of calibration between confidence and accuracy for misinformation items, a greater desire to please, greater externally oriented thinking, and a stronger belief in a just world, when compared with individuals who did not repeatedly demonstrate susceptibility.

It is easy to presume knowledge of the ""other"", but as we know this can be based in prejudice, cultural difference, or simply misinformation or simplification. Usually our explorations of this process have focused on populations identified as disadvantaged, disempowered or somehow ""non-privileged"". However, the research process outlined here has revealed previously unexplored diversity within a population commonly described as privileged suggesting that good governance requires alertness to presuming to know both the unprivileged and the privileged. The research approach outlined in this paper has used a blend of historical reappraisal and qualitative techniques focusing on a population who have been conceptualized as doubly privileged. This population focus is that of older British; post World War II male migrants in South Australia. These people have been conceptualized as privileged because they are male, and they were part of the preferred ethnic group that Australian politicians and policy makers favoured post WW2. However, review of the historical data and qualitative interviews with some of these men show that the accepted narrative of a homogenous pre-WW2 British origin population is over simplistic. The historical research suggests that the presumption that post WW2 British migrant men were coming into an homogenous, privileging environment in migrating to SA is both ahistorical and crude. Furthermore the belief that post WW2 British migrant men were ethnically homogenous is undermined by the qualitative research, that reveals that their presumed homogeneity is much more fluid and nuanced than dominant conceptualisations have allowed. The impact of core ethnicities that continue to exist and compete in Britain, the social class focus and economic commodification of migrants in the machinations of powerful players in the state of South Australia all confound homogenizing, simplistic knowing of British migrant men in this state. Generically these findings caution social researchers with regard to presuming to know so called ""privileged"" populations as well as presumed non-privileged groups. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-76049127600"

Experiment used those participants who scored high on four arousal states and average on rest of the three arousal states. Participants viewed a video clip, depicting a murder, followed by presentation of one week delayed post event information and recognition test for details of the event. Results indicated that participants who were misled retained less number of details of the event than did the participants who were given either consistent or no post event information. High scorer energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants retained more details of the event than did the high scorer tense arousal and anger/frustration participants under all the three post event information conditions. However, high tense arousal and anger/frustration participants' eyewitness retention dropped more sharply when they were given misleading post event information in comparison to the high energetic arousal and hedonic tone participants.

Later, in a misinformation phase, participants viewed sentences describing the studied photographs, some of which contained information conflicting with that depicted in the photographs. One day later, participants returned for a surprise item memory recognition test for the content of the photographs. Results showed reliable creation of false memories, in that participants reported information that had been presented in the verbal misinformation but not in the photographs. Several regions were more active during the OEP for later accurate memory than for forgetting, but they were also more active for later false memories, indicating that false memories in this paradigm are not simply caused by failure to encode the original event.

Current epidemiology indicates that among Pacific Islanders in the United States, young adults are at highest risk of HIV and HPV. In our inductive community based participatory research study, we used focus groups and key informant interviews (March-August 2010) with young adults, parents, community leaders, and providers (n = 95) to identify and contextualize factors that shape HIV and HPV risk and prevention among young adults in Chamorro and Tongan communities in Southern California. We identified nine themes that incorporated the following principal factors: misinformation and otherization; dominant concerns regarding premarital pregnancy; restricted intergenerational communication; family shame and privacy; gendered manifestations of religio-cultural norms; barriers impeding access to sexual health resources; parents' role in prevention; community vs. individual responsibility; and family and ethnic pride. Our thematic findings fit well with Rhodes' ""risk and enabling environment"" heuristic (2009), which we used to contextualize risk and prevention at micro and macro levels of physical, social, economic, and policy environments. We propose the addition of a separate cultural environment to the heuristic and conclude that a focus on applying individual and community agency at the micro-level would be an approachable starting point for intervention for our local Pacific Islander communities and groups in similar ecological contexts globally. Enhanced community-led education programs and engagement of religious and other community leaders to facilitate intergenerational communication could counteract taboos that obstruct prevention. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862597897"

From its origins in the late 1990s, Positive Psychology has acquired great popularity without any critical thinking. The dissemination of its un-innovative discourse in the mass media and specialized journals is an example of the popularity it has gained. This unquestioned acceptance of the discourse of Positive Psychology has taken place all over the world, including Spain and Latin America. After reviewing the general characteristics of Positive Psychology, the article discusses the shortcomings that this paradigm should overcome to be considered reliable and valid. Succinctly, the review concludes that the theoretical approach of Positive Psychology is not novel. The discourse that supports positive psychology as a new and original approach is in fact an exhibition of disinformation and ignorance of Philosophy, cultural Anthropology and the history of Psychology. In conclusion, the future of Positive Psychology requires overcoming the serious theoretical and practical problems that prevent it from being considered a new paradigm. © International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862649594"

We addressed this question by manipulating subjects' expectations, leading them to believe that they either had the same, higher or lower ""visual acuity"" than their partner while they watched a movie together. To create ample opportunities for the pairs to mention misleading details to one another, each member unknowingly saw a different version of the movie. The pairs then discussed some of the critical differences, but not others. Later, everyone took an independent recognition test.

It is intuitively plausible that they do not, for they appear to be only luckily true. I argue, however, that, despite its intuitive plausibility, this view is mistaken: once we adopt an adequate (modal) conception of epistemic luck and an adequate (adaptive) general approach to memory, it becomes clear that memory beliefs resulting from the incorporation of accurate testimonial information are not in general luckily true.

Loftus (2003) reveals that misleading information presented to participants after watching a short film clip often results in participants subsequently adopting the misled information as a true memory. The current study employs the misinformation paradigm to investigate the effect of immediate forced false responses on delayed recognition memory accuracy and confidence for a simulated crime scene. It was predicted that forcing participants to make false responses on a multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after viewing the video would decrease delayed memory accuracy in a week-later testing, especially for peripheral compared to central details. Additionally, experimenters predicted for low levels of confidence to be correlated with the forced false responses in the initial testing phase and an increase in confidence responses in a week-later testing.

While this was more typical of academic environments in the 1950s, partly because the study of homosexuality was largely based on clinical or correctional populations, academic environments have usually been in the forefront of empirical and social discussion of sexuality. Preventing such discussion (which maintains outdated pathological or criminal theories of homosexuality), thus becomes a significant agenda of those attempting to maintain anti-homosexual attitudes. Further, when anti-homosexual attitudes have characterized a particular professional group, prevention of any discussion that may reveal that the position of that group was without empirical foundation also serves the function of maintaining their authority as experts and allows restrictions on the human rights of homosexual or bisexual individuals to go unchallenged. Rarely, however, has this resulted in a direct attempt to silence academic discussion, through the invocation of legal sanctions. This article looks at the history of such an attempt in Finland, where an adherent of classical psychoanalysis fought to challenge progress and reverse the tide of scientific and clinical evidence that judged homosexuality to be non-pathological.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70449653429"

However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements.

However, different questions yielded strikingly different results. The highest rate of partisan division was generated by a CBS/New York Times closed-ended question that included potentially leading introductory sentences. The smallest partisan gap in apparent misinformation was generated by an ABC News/Washington Post open-ended question that did not ask a follow-up that was needed to gauge public beliefs about whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States. This paper reviews the polls on birtherism and describes an experiment embedded in a nationally representative sample survey testing whether methodological features of these two questions might have distorted their results and caused the apparent discrepancy between them. A version of the closed-ended question including the leading introductory sentences yielded a much larger degree of apparent partisan division than did a version of the question without the introductory sentences. Following the open question with another question that clarified people's beliefs (asking about whether Hawaii was part of the United States at the time of Barack Obama's birth) did not alter the conclusions supported by that item about the accuracy of public understanding. This study therefore illustrates how different question wording caused different polls to produce notably different results and provides a caution about the use of potentially leading wording. © The Author 2014.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897436732"

Heuristic and motivated reasoning literatures suggest that voters' preexisting values interact with political sophistication such that politically knowledgeable voters develop systematically distorted empirical beliefs relevant to the initiatives on their ballots. These beliefs, in turn, can predict voting preferences even after controlling for underlying values, regardless of one's political sophistication. These hypotheses were tested using a 2003 voter survey conducted prior to a statewide initiative election that repealed a workplace safety regulation. Results showed that only those voters knowledgeable of key endorsements had initiative-specific beliefs that lined up with their underlying antiregulation values. Also, voters' empirical beliefs had an effect on initiative support even after controlling for prior values, and political sophistication did not moderate this effect. © 2009 International Society of Political Psychology.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350530304"

Their difficulties highlight the influence of factual misinformation in national politics and the extent to which it correlates with citizens' political views. In this essay, I explain how greater elite polarization and the growth in media choice have reinforced the partisan divide in factual beliefs. To illustrate these points, I analyze debates over health care reform in 1993-1994 and 2009-2010, tracing the spread of false claims about reform proposals from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and analyzing the prevalence of misinformation in public opinion. Since false beliefs are extremely difficult to correct, I conclude by arguing that increasing the reputational costs for dishonest elites might be a more effective approach to improving democratic discourse.

These effects have interesting implications for eyewitness accounts, which in real-world contexts typically involve encoding an aversive event under stressful conditions followed by potential exposure to misinformation. The present study investigated memory for a negative event encoded under stress and subsequent misinformation endorsement. Healthy young adults participated in a between-groups design with three experimental sessions conducted 48. h apart. Session one consisted of a psychosocial stress induction (or control task) followed by incidental encoding of a negative slideshow. During session two, participants were asked questions about the slideshow, during which a random subgroup was exposed to misinformation. Memory for the slideshow was tested during the third session. Assessment of memory accuracy across stress and no-stress groups revealed that stress induced just prior to encoding led to significantly better memory for the slideshow overall. The classic misinformation effect was also observed - participants exposed to misinformation were significantly more likely to endorse false information during memory testing. In the stress group, however, memory accuracy and misinformation effects were moderated by arousal experienced during encoding of the negative event. Misinformed-stress group participants who reported that the negative slideshow elicited high arousal during encoding were less likely to endorse misinformation for the most aversive phase of the story. Furthermore, these individuals showed better memory for components of the aversive slideshow phase that had been directly misinformed. Results from the current study provide evidence that stress and high subjective arousal elicited by a negative event act concomitantly during encoding to enhance emotional memory such that the most aversive aspects of the event are well remembered and subsequently more resistant to misinformation effects. © 2013 The Authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901947840"

Like simulations of future events, counterfactual simulations serve adaptive functions. However, future simulation can also result in various kinds of distortions and has thus been characterised as an adaptive constructive process. Here we approach counterfactual thinking as such and examine whether it can distort memory for actual events. In Experiments 1a/b young and older adults imagined themselves experiencing different scenarios. Participants then imagined the same scenario again, engaged in no further simulation of a scenario, or imagined a counterfactual outcome. On a subsequent recognition test participants were more likely to make false alarms to counterfactual lures than novel scenarios. Older adults were more prone to these memory errors than younger adults. In Experiment 2 younger and older participants selected and performed different actions, then recalled performing some of those actions, imagined performing alternative actions to some of the selected actions, and did not imagine others. Participants, especially older adults, were more likely to falsely remember counterfactual actions than novel actions as previously performed. The findings suggest that counterfactual thinking can cause source confusion based on internally generated misinformation, consistent with its characterisation as an adaptive constructive process. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84891345927"

For example, the myths surrounding vaccinations, which prompted some parents to withhold immunization from their children, have led to a marked increase in vaccine-preventable disease, as well as unnecessary public expenditure on research and public-information campaigns aimed at rectifying the situation.We first examine the mechanisms by which such misinformation is disseminated in society, both inadvertently and purposely. Misinformation can originate from rumors but also from works of fiction, governments and politicians, and vested interests. Moreover, changes in the media landscape, including the arrival of the Internet, have fundamentally influenced the ways in which information is communicated and misinformation is spread.We next move to misinformation at the level of the individual, and review the cognitive factors that often render misinformation resistant to correction. We consider how people assess the truth of statements and what makes people believe certain things but not others. We look at people's memory for misinformation and answer the questions of why retractions of misinformation are so ineffective in memory updating and why efforts to retract misinformation can even backfire and, ironically, increase misbelief. Though ideology and personal worldviews can be major obstacles for debiasing, there nonetheless are a number of effective techniques for reducing the impact of misinformation, and we pay special attention to these factors that aid in debiasing.We conclude by providing specific recommendations for the debunking of misinformation. These recommendations pertain to the ways in which corrections should be designed, structured, and applied in order to maximize their impact. Grounded in cognitive psychological theory, these recommendations may help practitioners-including journalists, health professionals, educators, and science communicators-design effective misinformation retractions, educational tools, and public-information campaigns. © The Author(s) 2012.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867886656"

Historians have often viewed the Venetian ambassadors as dispassionate and sophisticated witnesses of the courts in which they served, and treated their reports, often uncritically, as unbiased and fully reliable appraisals. More recently, however, some scholars have cast doubts on the their value and indeed their validity as historical testimonies. Critiques have tended to focus on two perceived problems: First, the sources are of little value because Venetian diplomats were not privy to the most sensitive and important political information, and therefore their reports are rife with hearsay and misinformation. Second, and more damning, Venetian diplomats are accused of being hopelessly biased and Veneto-centric and therefore inaccurate and unreliable reporters, rendering their relazioni useful not as testimonies of the cultures observed, but as windows into the cultural attitudes and values of the observers. Ironically, these challenges have originated primarily from scholars of Venice, precisely at a time when the relazioni are being rediscovered and revalued by scholars of the Ottoman Empire. In this paper I focus on the Venetian relazioni on the Ottoman Empire, and argue that while the relazioni have much to tell us both about the individuals and the ruling class that produced them, when reconsidered within the institutional context in which they were generated, these reports, while not the ideal and idealized source of Ranke, still can provide an accurate window onto the political and cultural realities of the Ottomans, as well as the attitudes and concerns of Venice. The relazioni do not simply represent an imagined or invented Ottoman Empire, nor do they merely refract the likeness of their authors onto the Ottoman visage. While the relazioni certainly construct an image of the Ottoman Empire, it is not always or entirely created in Venice's self-image.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054922670"

We use survey experiments to assess whether realistic exposure to a conspiracy claim affects conspiracy beliefs and trust in government. These experiments yield interesting and potentially surprising results. We discover that respondents who are asked whether they believe in a conspiracy claim after reading a specific allegation actually report lower beliefs than those not exposed to the specific claim. Turning to trust in government, we find that exposure to a conspiracy claim has a potent negative effect on trust in government services and institutions including those unconnected to the allegations. Moreover, and consistent with our belief experiment, we find that first asking whether people believe in the conspiracy mitigates the negative trust effects. Combining these findings suggests that conspiracy exposure increases conspiracy beliefs and reduces trust, but that asking about beliefs prompts additional thinking about the claims which softens and/or reverses the exposure’s effect on beliefs and trust. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027921065"

However, little is known about the effects of false positive information about political figures. In three experiments, we find that discrediting positive information generates a ""punishment effect"" that is inconsistent with the previous literature on belief perseverance. We argue people attempt to adjust for the perceived influence of the false claim when the information is discredited. In this case, when trying to account for the effects of discredited positive information about a politician, people overestimate how much correction is needed and thus end up with a more negative opinion. (By contrast, people underestimate how much correction is needed to adjust for false negative information, leading to belief perseverance.)

Evidence is mixed regarding how well participants can use confidence judgments to discriminate between their correct and misled memory reports. We tested the prediction that the confidence-accuracy relationship for misled details depends upon the availability of source cues at retrieval. In Experiment 1, participants (N=77) viewed a videotaped staged crime before reading a misleading narrative. After seven minutes or one week, the participants completed a cued recall test for the details of the original event. Prior to completing the test, all participants were warned that the narrative contained misleading details to encourage source monitoring. The results showed that the strength of the confidence-accuracy relationship declined significantly over the delay. We interpret our results in the source monitoring framework. After an extended delay, fewer diagnostic source details were available to participants, increasing reliance on retrieval fluency as a basis for memory and metamemory decisions. We tested this interpretation in a second experiment, in which participants (N=42) completed a source monitoring test instead of a cued recall test. We observed a large effect of retention interval on source monitoring, and no significant effect on item memory.

People enjoy sharing information, even when they do not believe it. Thus, misinformation (inaccurate information) and disinformation (deceptive information) diffuse throughout social networks, as misinforming and disinforming are varieties of information behaviour. Social media have made such diffusion easier and faster. Many information behaviour models, however, suggest a normative model of information as true, accurate, complete, despite the ubiquity of misinformation and disinformation. Analysis. Misinformation and disinformation are defined and we show how they extend the concept of information through their informativeness. Table 1 summarizes the features of information, misinformation, and disinformation. Figure 1 illustrates the social diffusion process by which misinforming and disinforming function as types of information behaviour. Conclusion. Misinformation and disinformation are closely linked to information literacy, especially in terms of how they are diffused and shared and how people use both cues to credibility and cues to deception to make judgements. Misinformation and disinformation present both challenges and opportunities for individuals, businesses, and governments. Future work in immersive, 3D virtual worlds takes a naturalistic approach to understand the principal elements of cues to misinformation and disinformation.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875330257"

Participants (N = 88) viewed ambiguous neutral images primed either at encoding or retrieval to be interpreted as either highly positive or negative (or neutral/not primed). After viewing the images, they either were asked misleading or non-leading questions. Following a delay, memory accuracy for the original images was assessed. Results indicated that any emotional priming at encoding led to a higher susceptibility to misinformation relative to priming at recall. In particular, inducing a negative interpretation of the image at encoding led to an increased susceptibility of false memories for major misinformation (an entire object not actually present in the scene). In contrast, this pattern was reversed when priming was used at recall; a negative reinterpretation of the image decreased memory distortion relative to unprimed images. These findings suggest that, with precise experimental control, the experience of emotion at event encoding, in particular, is implicated in false memory susceptibility. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907394084"

This chapter places this quest within the context of recent psychological theorizing related to the Meaning Maintenance Model (Proulx and Heine, Psychol Inq, 17:309-318, 2006). This model suggests that threats to one's sense of meaning motivate compensatory efforts to create an environment that appears meaningful-especially by changing the world, one's perceptions of it, or one's beliefs. We suggest that societal teachings about drugs are often at odds with individual experiences, essentially threatening meaning. This threat then encourages further inquiry about drugs, potentially increasing use or motivating questions about societal teachings. A review of recent empirical support for the Meaning Maintenance Model leads to novel predictions about the potential effects of misinformation about drug use motives and behavior. This information might inadvertently motivate drug experiences, altering expectancies and contributing to use. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

In cognitive psychology, the malleable nature of long-term memory has been extensively documented. Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hand, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

Here, we sought to test the generality of RES and to further elucidate its underlying mechanisms. To that end, we tested a dual mechanism account, which suggests that RES occurs because initial testing (a) enhances learning of the later misinformation by reducing proactive interference and (b) causes the reactivated memory trace to be more susceptible to later interference (i.e., a reconsolidation account). Three major findings emerged. First, RES was found after a 1-week delay, where a robust testing benefit occurred for event details that were not contradicted by later misinformation. Second, blockage of reconsolidation was unnecessary for RES to occur.

As of April 2014, the database contained 12 439 unique substances from 47 909 dossiers. This vast database could be used to refine existing, or to create new, non-testing methods, such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). Acute fish toxicity data were mined from the ECHA database using the eChemPortal; after filtering for single organic substances, 1159 experimental data points remained, representing 564 compounds. To evaluate the quality and accessibility of this data, the authors used the data to refine and improve an existing QSAR. The reliability of the data submitted to the ECHA database, as well as the effectiveness of the Klimisch scoring system, were assessed by comparing the refined QSAR with established QSAR benchmarks. The model developed meets all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles, has strong internal (leave-one-out internally cross-validated correlation coefficient [Q2LOO]=0.91) and external (external coefficient of determination (predicted vs experimental [test set])) validation statistics, and can provide reliable fish median lethal concentration (LC50) predictions for non-polar narcotics. Although some issues with dossier misinformation were discovered, it was found that the ECHA dissemination portal is a valuable and reliable data source. When queried using the eChemPortal, chemical dossiers containing reliable data could be found quickly.

We assumed opposition to vaccination in general to be an 'unfounded fear', reflecting ignorance and perceived vulnerability among low-socioeconomic status (SES) people, and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine a 'legitimate concern' reflecting the elite's commitment to 'risk culture' in a 'risk society'. We indirectly tested these assumptions by investigating the socioeconomic profiles associated with opposition to vaccination in general and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine specifically. Our second aim was to determine whether or not opposition to the H1N1 vaccine fuelled opposition to vaccination in general. We used data from a telephone survey conducted in 2009-2010 among a random sample of French people aged 15-79 (N=9480). Attitudes toward vaccination in general and toward the H1N1 vaccine specifically varied significantly between October 2009 and June 2010 with strong correlation being observed between these attitudes throughout the whole period. In multivariable analysis attitudes toward vaccination in general remained a significant predictor of attitudes to the H1N1 vaccine and vice versa, for distinct profiles as follows: males, older people, low-SES people for opposition to vaccination in general, versus females, people aged 35-49 and those with an intermediate SES for opposition to the H1N1 vaccine. Results also differed regarding indicators of social vulnerability, proximity to preventive medicine and vaccination history. The first profile supported the ""unfounded fears expressed by low-SES people"" hypothesis, while the second echoed previous work related to middle-classes' ""healthism"". Opposition to vaccination should not be reduced to irrational reactions reflecting ignorance or misinformation and further research is needed to acquire a greater understanding of the motives of opponents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899526183"

Some research suggests that claims have more credibility when independent sources make them. Yet, other research suggests that simply repeating information makes it more accessible and encourages reliance on automatic processes-factors known to change people's judgments. In Experiment 1, people took part in a ""misinformation"" study: people first watched a video of a crime and later read eyewitness reports attributed to one or three different eyewitnesses who made misleading claims in either one report or repeated the same misleading claims across all three reports. In Experiment 2, people who had not seen any videos read those same reports and indicated how confident they were that each claim happened in the original event. People were more misled by-and more confident about-claims that were repeated, regardless of how many eyewitnesses made them.

All were presented as having been written by a female co-witness and they differed in terms of her age (young adult or elderly) and who she blamed for the crime (the perpetrator, the innocent bystander, or nobody). One week later the participants were asked who committed the crime. When the young adult co-witness had blamed the innocent bystander just over 40% of participants subsequently did the same. Few participants (less than 8%) in the other conditions subsequently blamed the innocent bystander. The elderly co-witness was also rated as less credible, less competent, and less accurate than the younger co-witness suggesting eyewitnesses were less likely to be influenced by her incorrect statement as they perceived her to be a less reliable source of information.

It is common for people to cite verses in the Qur'an or the achievements of medieval Muslim philosophers to support this view. Furthermore, there is widespread recognition that science (usually in its applied form) is essential for progress. In fact the dominant narrative in the Muslim world sees Islam as a rational religion in harmony with modern science. At the same time many Muslims see the theory of biological evolution as a challenge to the Islamic account of creation. Thus, when a well-established scientific idea, such as biological evolution, clashes with the religious beliefs of many Muslims, we find complex reactions, ranging from selectively rejecting the relevant science to ignoring the troublesome idea, without harming the outwardly harmonious framework. It is quite possible, nonetheless, that the Muslim world will become the focal point of evolution–creation controversies in the coming years. Low educational standards in combination with widespread misinformation about evolutionary ideas make many countries in the Muslim world fertile ground for anti-evolutionary movements. In addition there already exists a growing and highly influential Islamic creationist movement, which made headlines in Europe in 2007 when French public schools received an unsolicited gift of an 850-page colour Atlas of creation, produced by a Muslim creationist from Turkey known by the name of Harun Yahya. Biological evolution, however, is still a relatively new concept for the majority of Muslims, and a serious debate over its compatibility with religion has not yet taken place. © Cambridge University Press 2010.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868210205"

When later interviewed, those children whose mothers were provided this misinformation were likely to wrongly report experiencing activities consistent with the maternal suggestion and embellish their reports of these activities with elaborative detail. Moreover, children whose mothers spoke in a highly elaborative manner were more likely to recall occurrences in line with the maternal suggestion and provided more fictitious narrative detail describing non-occurring-but-suggested information than did children whose mothers used a less elaborative style.

Contagion was reduced, for both accurate and inaccurate information, when participants worked with a partner perceived to be of low as compared with high credibility. Participants also showed reduced contagion after working with an out-group as compared with an in-group partner.

The Eisenhower administration's decision to deploy Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) on the territory of NATO allies sought to redress the perceived vulnerability until American ICBMs were ready. British deception planners considered how to enhance the threat posed by the IRBMs. An outline plan codenamed 'Celestial' was intended to persuade the Soviets that the otherwise vulnerable missiles could not be readily neutralised. This article explores this deception and how such planning also sought to convey accurate information alongside disinformation.

An index to measure cancer stigma could empower health program developers and policymakers by identifying the key areas in which a population could benefit from education to change perceptions and address misinformation. The index also could be used to rank countries and communities based on their level of cancer stigma to assess where interventions are needed. We used structured literature review and expert review to generate a cancer stigma item pool. The item pool was subject to cognitive interviews for cultural appropriateness and comprehension; and data from initial pilot testing were used to reduce the pool of items for translation and field testing. The field test was conducted using a web-based survey in four samples representing two regions and three languages—English and Arabic speakers in Jordan and Egypt, and English and Mandarin Chinese speakers in China. Factor analyses and item response theory were applied to finalize the index. The analyses resulted in a 12-item cancer stigma index (CSI) that was reliable across all four samples. The CSI scores were highly correlated with a general illness stigma scale, and operated as expected noting higher cancer stigma among men and those with lower income. The CSI can be used to inform initial cancer education efforts, identifying overall stigma levels in a country or community and particular issue areas requiring intervention. © The Author(s) 2014.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907275313"

In this study we assessed whether this dissociability is a quality peculiar to false memory, or whether it represents a general characteristic of autobiographical memory. To this end we examined whether people can be induced to stop believing in memories for true experiences. Participants observed and performed simple actions, and were later falsely informed that they had not performed some of them-that false memories for these actions had been implanted through the use of fabricated evidence. Before and after receiving this misinformation, participants rated their belief in and memory of performing those actions, other actions that they had also performed, and actions that they had not performed. Whereas the misinformation substantially undermined participants' beliefs in the specific performed actions about which they had been misinformed, it had little effect on their endorsement of remembering those actions. The misinformation thus boosted the proportion of occasions in which participants rated their memories as stronger than their beliefs, and it weakened the correlation between belief and memory ratings. Thus, this study provides the first experimental demonstration of non-believed memories of true experiences. We discuss our findings with reference to the small literature concerning the use of socially-communicated misinformation to undermine event memories, and with reference to the structure of autobiographical memory. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890137087"

In Experiment 1, 6/7-year-olds, 11/12-year-olds, and adults received a video and were confronted with misinformation about related but nonpresented details. Older children and adults had higher misinformation acceptance rates than younger children. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding adding a younger child group (4/6-year-olds).

However, these findings are as yet failing to resonate with and promote the need for mitigation action among the general public and policymakers in many countries, inhibiting the establishment of concerted global action to combat the escalation of climate change. Subsequently, there is a need to re-evaluate how the general public interprets and understands the complex issues surrounding climate change generally and the impacts of climate change on Antarctica more specifically. Barriers to garnering public support for action are numerous and diverse, from the individual’s worldview, cognitive reinforcement and religious beliefs to the misreporting and miscommunication of climate science by the media, as well as the influence of vested interests. In order to combat misinformation and to familiarise the general public with the value of Antarctic science and the importance of research output in guiding climate policy formation, substantial efforts must be made in education, outreach and communication (EOC) strategies. We suggest that the establishment of an Antarctic Climate Education, Outreach and Communication Standing Committee as a part of the highly respected Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research could provide the foundation for boundary work at the interface of climate science and policy, in which EOC strategies are strongly integrated and valued. By raising awareness and increasing public understanding of the complex issues and interactions of Antarctica and the global climate system, the scientific community can better channel the importance of action to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions to prevent catastrophic climate change and potentially provide the catalyst required for substantial climate change action. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014854480"

This experimental study demonstrates that the independent experience of two emotions, anger and anxiety, in part determines whether citizens consider misinformation in a partisan or open-minded fashion. Anger encourages partisan, motivated evaluation of uncorrected misinformation that results in beliefs consistent with the supported political party, while anxiety at times promotes initial beliefs based less on partisanship and more on the information environment. However, exposure to corrections improves belief accuracy, regardless of emotion or partisanship. The results indicate that the unique experience of anger and anxiety can affect the accuracy of political beliefs by strengthening or attenuating the influence of partisanship. © 2015 International Communication Association.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938206051"

Surprisingly, the reversibility of the effect (after an initial occurrence) has remained largely unexplored. Based on a memory conversion theoretical framework and associated refined assessment strategy, we report three experiments to demonstrate that suggestive influence can be completely undone. Initially established misinformation effects were eliminated - even after a period of 5. weeks (Exp. 3) - through (a) an enlightenment procedure ensuring an adequate representation of the memory task as a search for potentially two contradictory items (instead of ""the"" single ""correct"" answer) and (b) using a memory state test that unconfounds the performance contributions of item and source memory by assessing them separately. Specifically, memory for original event details that were the target of misinformation was restored to the level of non-misled control performance, and even beyond (Exp. 3). This remarkable reversibility of misinformation influence highlights the central role of memory conversion processes in the misinformation effect (but does not principally exclude the contribution of traditional interference processes).

Now users are acquiring information from the internet and using it to make important decisions. This method of acquisition is threatening the epistemological protection librarians have provided. The problem is one of verifiability, the users do not have a way to verify whether information is accurate or inaccurate. The verification is even more difficult with disinformation. The purpose of this paper is to explore possible alternatives to this problem and recommend using a new multi-literacy instructional method as the solution. Design/methodology/approach: A review of current literature confirmed the problem of disinformation and this paper examines possible solutions to controlling disinformation and makes suggestions on how we, as librarians, can use instruction to protect internet users from the harmful effects of using the false information. Findings: Research found that disinformation is a widespread problem and its use has epistemic consequences that are harmful to internet users. The paper proposes a new method of instruction using a combination of learning paradigms to help users protect themselves from disinformation.

Because streamflow is expensive to continuously measure directly, it is usually derived from measured water levels, using a rating curve modeling the stage-discharge relationship. In alpine streams, this practice is complicated by the fact that the streambed constantly changes due to erosion and sedimentation by the turbulent mountain streams. This makes the stage-discharge relationship dynamic, requiring frequent discharge gaugings to have reliable streamflow estimates. During an ongoing field study in the Val Ferret watershed in the Swiss Alps, 93 streamflow values were measured in the period 2009-2011 using salt dilution gauging with the gulp injection method. The natural background electrical conductivity in the stream, which was measured as by-product of these gaugings, was shown to be a strong predictor for the streamflow, even marginally outperforming water level. Analysis of the residuals of both predictive relations revealed errors in the gauged streamflows. These could be corrected by filtering disinformation from erroneous calibration coefficients. In total, extracting information from the auxiliary data enabled to reduce the uncertainty in the rating curve, as measured by the root-mean-square error in log-transformed streamflow relative to that of the original stage-discharge relationship, by 43.7%. © 2013.

Before the 9/11 attack, the American intelligence system was always ambivalent towards intelligence material derived from open sources including media, journals, and other publicly available sources. However, in the wake of the September 11 bombing, OSINT found a new appreciation on the part of legislators and intelligence managers. This newfound interest on open sources resulted in the creation of a new office dedicated to Open Source which is under the direction of the Director of National Intelligence and which is managed by the CIA. Although in previous years, OSINT was seen as unnecessary to national intelligence due to the tendency of the low reliability of sources arising from the misinformation, secret messages, disinformation, and nonsense content of OSINT sources, the OSINT when properly used is believed to be as crucial as the most secretive and expensive aspects of intelligence collection. Together with other forms of intelligence collection, OSINT provides information about adversaries and enemies. Properly interpreted, OSINT can be just as enlightening as a wellinformed secret agent, or an image from an unmanned spy aircraft. In the end, what is most significant is the system'S ability to give sound judgments to decision makers. © 2010 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

While, not all emergency situations are of the same scale, they have a number of things in common. This chapter describes the impact that emergencies can have on people and organizations; the emergency management principles; the importance of hazard identification, vulnerability analysis, and risk assessment; and the role of communication in coordination and collaboration among emergency responders. Various types of emergencies include medical events and accidents, fires and evacuations, shelter in place and lockdown incidents, bomb threats and suspicious packages, disasters, and terrorist actions. These and many other types of emergency situations can happen to any organization at any time. Hazard identification, risk assessment, and impact analysis are important steps in the planning process, because many of the key decisions made relative to the emergency plan are based on this information. Procedures for dealing with the media are another important area that cannot be overlooked; however, being prepared ahead of time to deal with the media can help an organization get through the incident without the additional damage that can be caused by misinformation and speculation. An effective emergency response plan involves four important components: planning, reviewing, training, and testing. The professional protection officer must be prepared to respond to such events in accordance with his or her organizational protocols, training, and, most important, good judgment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We examine how collective patterns of user behavior under conditions of shared attention are distinct from other ""bursts"" of activity like breaking news events. Using 290 million tweets from a panel of 193,532 politically active Twitter users, we compare features of their behavior during eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election to examine how patterns of social media use change during these media events compared to ""typical"" time and whether these changes are attributable to shifts in the behavior of the population as a whole or shifts from particular segments such as elites. Compared to baseline time periods, our findings reveal that media events not only generate large volumes of tweets, but they are also associated with (1) substantial declines in interpersonal communication, (2) more highly concentrated attention by replying to and retweeting particular users, and (3) elite users predominantly benefiting from this attention. These findings empirically demonstrate how bursts of activity on Twitter during media events significantly alter underlying social processes of interpersonal communication and social interaction. Because the behavior of large populations within socio-technical systems can change so dramatically, our findings suggest the need for further research about how social media responses to media events can be used to support collective sensemaking, to promote informed deliberation, and to remain resilient in the face of misinformation. © 2014 Lin et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901294466"

By analyzing children's television for its portrayal of race and ethnicity, this chapter will explore the role media play in children's understanding of people and cultures outside of their own. A textual analysis of episodes of Maya & Miguel, the chapter describes the depiction of several cultures found represented on the program including White, Asian, African, Dominican, and Mexican and how race, ethnicity, and culture is framed in the television program. Some theories suggest that television is a primary tool in the socialization of children. Children are attracted to the animation in cartoons, the colors, the movement and the easy-to-follow simplicity of the dialogue. Given the impressionable nature of children, it is possible that they begin to act out the biased nature of the cartoons they watch. Thus, considering their vulnerability, information literacy is relevant to discerning media messages. In this way, information literacy converges with media literacy and visual literacy. Guiding children to interrogate what they view is critically important especially when they are at an age where they can be easily influenced by misinformation or dominant messages. Additionally, the volume of information is steadily increasing in the 21st century as are the modes for accessing, creating and manipulating information. Thus, this work will demonstrate how promoting participatory learning by objectively viewing media and exercising reflective thinking will be important components of children's education in this millennium. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901257470"

To better understand the influence of co-witnesses we compared the influence of co-witness misinformation with the influence of misinformation provided by an interviewer. Across two experiments using the MORI paradigm we found no evidence that a co-witness is particularly influential relative to another social source of post-event misinformation. In fact, the source of the misinformation delivered by our interviewer was less likely to be correctly recalled than the source of the misinformation delivered by a co-witness. There was some evidence that misinformation delivered by both a co-witness and an interviewer has a stronger effect on witnesses' accuracy and confidence than misinformation obtained from either source alone. Finally, our results suggest that the opportunity to provide an early individual memory account might protect against the effect of subsequently-encountered co-witness misinformation.

I argue that even denial formed in ignorance of the organised misinformation campaign often constitutes a kind of arrogance, but that it is quite possible to humbly doubt the climate change problem. In some cases denial flows from other more or less serious errors or vices, such as ignorance, sincere but mistaken belief, dishonesty or selfishness. Those who press the arrogance charge also risk being arrogant in doing so. Educators can do a number of things to promote greater humility about climate change, including providing experiences that increase people’s appreciation of their individual and general human limitations and improving their ability to distinguish credible from discreditable sources of scientific information and factual from normative dimensions of the climate change problem. © 2015 The White Horse Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947229876"

One concern is that students sometimes indiscriminately forward misinformation. Understanding the reasons behind misinformation sharing would help the development of IL intervention strategies. Guided by the Uses and Gratifications approach and rumor research, undergraduate and graduate students in Singapore were surveyed on why they share misinformation on social media. Gender and study-level differences were investigated. Over 60% of respondents had shared misinformation. The top reasons were related to the information's perceived characteristics, as well as self-expression and socializing. Accuracy and authoritativeness did not rank highly. Women had a higher prevalence of sharing and intention to share misinformation. Undergraduate and graduate students differed in their reasons for sharing misinformation. The former share (and intend to share) more misinformation than the latter, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because many of the reasons cited were social in nature, IL training should address the social motivations propelling such behavior.

The remaining three conditions initially presented the story as factual. Participants in two of these conditions were informed after reading the story that it was inaccurate due to a) accidental error or b) intentional deception. The story changed attitudes from a no-story control in all conditions.

In the present research, social postwarnings, which characterize the postevent source as a low-credibility individual, diminished the misinformation effect in both cued recall and recognition tests. Discrediting the source as being either untrustworthy or incompetent was effective (Experiment 1). Also, postwarned participants rated reality characteristics of their memories more accurately than did participants receiving no or high-credibility information about the postevent source (Experiment 2). A social postwarning yielded the same results as an explicit source-monitoring appeal and led to longer response times for postevent items, relative to a no-warning condition (Experiments 3 and 4). The findings suggest that the reduced misinformation effect was due to more thorough monitoring of memory characteristics by postwarned participants, rather than to a stricter response criterion or to enhanced event memory.

The study group consisted of 283 unmarried students at several schools who were, on average, 19 years of age. Results suggested that effective contraceptive behavior associated most strongly with respondents' perceiving relatively few barriers to their use of contraception, their maintenance of extensive interpersonal skills, and their regarding peer norms as consistent with effective contraceptive behavior. Findings also underlined a need for continuing education about sexuality and contraception. Dangerous misinformation prevailed regarding respondents' knowledge of areas that include anatomy, physiology, and appropriate use of effective contraceptive methods. Finally, results implied a need to consider broad behavioral, social, and interpersonal issues as they relate to young adults' effective contraceptive behavior.

Among the sexually experienced, 76.9% reported use of specific methods deemed effective at last coitus. More than 60% underestimated pregnancy rates of adolescents, and approximately 43% agreed that ""pregnancy just isn't something that would happen to me or a sexual partner."" 85.1% agreed that dealing with an unplanned pregnancy would be painful, and 86.7% disagreed that contraception made coitus less enjoyable. 94.7% believed that males and females should share the responsibility for birth control. However, 72.5% of both sexes thought males should be responsible for birth control availability while, in a separate item, 88.3% felt it was the female's responsibility. Furthermore, 27.3% held the notion that females with accessible contraception would be deemed promiscuous. 52.4% agreed that coitus should be spontaneous, 40.8% also felt that birth control makes intercourse seem preplanned.

In the Unexpected Change story ignorance could be directly inferred from the emphasized fact that the target character had not witnessed the change, while false belief required the additional inference that the character would assume that things would stay as they had been initially. In the Misinformation Story false belief was made directly accessible by the content of a false message, while ignorance was not directly indicated by absence of information. It needed to be inferred from the fact that the available information was misleading. Results from 3- and 4-year-old Austrian and English children showed that manipulation of inferential difficulty did not affect their ability to make epistemic state attribution. In both stories children found it easier to attribute ignorance than false belief. To integrate this finding in the larger developmental context we suggest that children younger than 4 years find it difficult to distinguish between knowledge and ignorance because they do not understand the role of informational access in the formation of knowledge and they fail in false-belief attribution because they do not understand that incompatible truth values can be assigned to propositions. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024218536"

By definition, the sector’s many aspects are kept secret. A major source of information about the PLA and RNA and their activities are their public statements, and the documents they have made available and interviews with personnel, but such information may contain positive bias about their respective organizations, omission of certain facts and sometimes deliberate misinformation about the other side. Newspaper reports are another source of information, but except for a few investigative reports “the reliability of news reports is always in doubt as some sensationalize the issue and others become protagonists of conflict, and some even play an advocacy role” in Nepal (Dhruba Kumar 2006: 103), while reports filed based on short trips in dangerous zones may contain information that may not have been verified with multiple sources. However, in the absence of other reliable sources of information, there is not much choice except to use this available information to describe and analyze the two armies’ performances. Our recognition of potential biases in the available information, we believe, has allowed us to weed out positive biases and misinformation. Further, collaboration between two authors, one with extensive experience in another country’s army, including counter-insurgency activities, and the other in academia, has allowed us to interrogate the available information with experiential and academic bases of knowledge. Hence, even though this study should not be taken as definitive in all aspects, we believe that until more in-depth analyses come forth, the chapter will provide urgently needed analysis of an important topic. © 2010 Mahendra Lawoti and Anup K.

Participants (N = 90) were recruited for research focusing on ""emotional processing"" and were not informed that their memories were being investigated. Then, they viewed either a highly positive, neutral, or highly negative emotional scene (e.g., graphic fatal accident) from the International Affective Picture System (e.g., Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1999). Half of participants were exposed to misleading questions - one of which included a major false suggestion (i.e., large animal in the scene). An hour later all participants were asked to recall the scene and asked 10 direct questions, five of which related to the misinformation provided earlier. Overall, misleading questions impaired recall accuracy by 37%. Further, negative emotion increased susceptibility to false memories for the major misinformation. Whereas 0% of non-misled participants in any condition recalled seeing the major false detail, misled participants in the negative condition recalled seeing the major false detail more often (80%) than those in the positive (40%) and neutral (40%) conditions.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041743133"

Five emergent themes extracted from premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women's discourse are identified and described through qualitative data analysis.

Using this case study, the relationship between the production of information about environmental problems and external institutions which address them, is examined. To see how certain analyses of change have gained credence and validity, while others ‐ including local people's own ‐ have been excluded from investigation, the relative dominance of particular disciplines, of methods and data sets within them, and of deductive theories guiding data interpretation, are considered. Such dominance depends on the sociopolitical and financial structures within which environmental policy institutions have evolved and operate. Resumé La gestion naturelle des resources: la réplacation et le déploiement de fausses informations sur l'environnement dans la zone de transition forêt‐savane en Guinée Depuis un siècle déjà, c'est sur une analyse erronnée des changements environnementaux que se fonde la politique environnementale dans une certaine partie de la Guinée. Dans la présente étude de cas, les auteurs offrent un examen du rapport entre la production de l'information concernant les problèmes environnementaux et les institutions externes qui s'y adressent. Pour voir dans quelle manière certaines analyses du changement sont devenues plus vraisemblables et donc plus acceptables alors que d'autres ‐ y compris celles des autochtones ‐ auraient été marginalisées de l'étude, les auteurs réfléchissent à la dominance relative des diverses disciplines, des méthodes et des séries de données au sein de celles‐ci, et des théories déductrices qui gèrent l'interprétation des données brutes. Cette dominance dépendrait des structures socio‐politiques et financières au sein desquelles se sont évoluées les institutions responsables de la politique environnementale, et au sein desquelles elles opèrent toujours.

This decrease in likelihood rating for the statement lied about is termed 'fabrication deflation'. In both studies, however, there were 10-16% of the participants who indicated maximum belief that the lie item was true. Whether this increase in likelihood rating for a lied about event is evidence of memory creation or the triggering of an actual memory is discussed.

It was posited that CSE might influence the way knowledge translates into behavior because individuals who feel they can and should use contraceptives may be more receptive to information. A secondary line of analysis examined the individual responses on the RCK to ascertain common knowledge and myths. The 521 respondents were from two diverse samples of teenage women attending family planning clinics. Although no significant relationships were found between RCK and behavior, the four-factor model of CSE explained 12% and 28% of the variance in RCK in the two samples. Results on the RCK items revealed sample differences and common areas of misinformation that are critical to effective contraceptive and prophylactic use. The findings are used to identify measurement issues that may account for the inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between RCK and behavior, and to recommend content for educational interventions.; A study of the relationships among adolescent females' contraceptive self-efficacy, contraceptive usage, and reproductive and contraceptive knowledge produced findings relevant to the content of sex education programs. Participants included 258 family planning clinic clients from Sunnyvale, California, and 263 such clients from Chicago, Illinois; the average age of respondents was 17.6 years. About 20% of women in both samples were not using a contraceptive method. The mean contraceptive use score, on a scale from 1 (inefficacious contraception) to 4 (highly efficacious contraceptive use), was 2.3 for the California group and 2.6 for the Illinois women. The mean reproductive and contraceptive knowledge score, on a scale from 1 to 7, was 4.2 in the former and 3.1 in the latter sample. Multivariate regression analyses failed to reveal any significant interactions among postulated predictors of contraceptive behavior (knowledge, self-efficacy, education, age, pregnancy and abortion history). Contraceptive self-efficacy was significantly related to knowledge for the communication, physical acceptance, and prevention subscales but not for the control subscale. Overall, the four self-efficacy subscales explained 12% of the variance in contraceptive usage in the Illinois sample and 28% of the variance in the California sample. Of concern were the high percentages of adolescents in both samples who were misinformed about the time during the menstrual cycle when the risk of pregnancy is greatest, the relative reliability of the various contraceptive methods, and proper condom use techniques. It is speculated that method-specific measures of knowledge and use would be more likely than the single indicators used in this study to detect interrelationships between knowledge and behavior.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029262142"

The present study investigated whether source-monitoring plays a similar role in children's suggestibility. It also examined whether the accuracy of source judgements is dependent on the type of source task employed at test. After watching a film and listening to a misleading narrative, 3-4- and 6-7-year-olds (n = 116) were encouraged to attend to source memory at retrieval. This was achieved either via sequential ""question pairs"", which are typically used in children's source-monitoring research, or via a novel ""posting-box"" procedure, in which all source options were provided simultaneously. Performance elicited by each type of source task was compared with that evoked by old/new recognition procedures. Posting-box, but not question pair, source cues were effective at reducing the magnitude of the suggestibility effect, relative to that observed under recognition conditions. Furthermore, source question pairs provoked a bias to respond affirmatively for 3-4-year-olds.

Several years after its defeat in a general election, the military regime began to look to Buddhism as a form of moral legitimacy in order to retain political power. The period from 1990 until Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest in July 1995 was one of ascendancy for the military regime (Fink 2001:78). In conditions of military repression, opinions about the regime are likely to be expressed in rumor. Skidmore (2003a: 13) has pointed out that rumor in urban Burmese spaces has become a form of broader discourse. I propose that rumors constitute ""popular resistance"" under the strict control of speech censorship and that they decode the moral legitimacy of the regime by the folk rubric of lawkī pyinnya (lit. ""this-worldly knowledge""). Historically, a great many rumors regarding the successive military regimes1 have existed in the public sphere, a prevalent one being that former Gen. Ne Win's absorption in astrology was such that the economic fortunes of the country lay in the hands of fortunetellers during the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) period (1962-1988). These kinds of rumors have not, however, been regarded as reliable resources for research, especially in the fields of political science and economics. On the other hand, many anthropologists collect village rumors and use them as legitimate informant discourse.2 Such ethnography has largely been conducted in relatively small communities where rumors can be easily confirmed, and it is not difficult to identify those transmitting rumors. In urban areas, however, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know the origin and extent of a rumor. Rumor has been an object of study in sociology and as a form of urban folklore.3 Morin, for example, defines rumor as a false story. He bases his argument on an analysis of Jewish trafficking of women in New Orleans as a story without any real basis (Morin 1980). Kapferer defines rumor more broadly as ""the emergence and circulation in society of information which is not publicly confirmed by official sources or denied by them"" (Kapferer 1990:13). He denies that an absolute reality exists in any society, emphasizing instead that truth-value is not of primary import for rumors and that reality is essentially social and exists in the place where it obtains the greatest social consensus. In this sense the creation and dissemination of Burmese rumor is truly a social act, one in which reality is contested and daily remade in the public domain. The rumors examined here were collected in Rangoon in 1991-1992, when I was conducting research on the religious practices of gaing membership and belief. Gaing is a term referring to a group of people organized around a founder who is known as a weikza (see below). Street rumors were commonly being discussed not only within my group of informants but also by the people around them, and it became clear that rumor was playing an important role for urban people. I checked on the veracity and circulation of the rumors in the central Kamayut township where I lived, and in the Ye Kyaw ward of distant Mingala Taung Nyun township where I conducted research. I asked about these rumors among a diverse range of informants including civil servants, office workers, merchants, shopkeepers, publishers, and also among people regarded as having expertise in lawkī pyinnya. I did not discuss rumors that I had heard, but instead waited for my informants to volunteer specific rumors. Among the many topics of Burmese rumors, in this chapter I focus upon a significant and prevalent kind of counterpolitical rumor that combines resistance to the regime with ""traditional"" folk knowledge and techniques such as astrology, omens, and yadaya (a technique for manipulating the results of astrology or portents). These forms of knowledge and practice have been documented in previous Burmese studies and in the ethnographic record.4 Astrology is consistently mentioned in these rumors concerning political power, particularly those rumors involving members of the ruling military council. Folk knowledge such as astrology is included in the broad category of lawkī pyinnya in Burma, but very little attention has been paid to this category of knowledge. This is not owing to an omission by scholars but is rather a reflection of the fact that it is rarely spoken of in daily life. This said, however, in locales where Buddhist ideology is dominant, Burmese people admit to a particular distinction between the everyday reality of the mundane world (lawkī) and lawkottara, otherworldly or ""more Buddhist"" events and issues. When people engage in practices focused upon lawkī, that is, the affairs of this world, they do so on the assumption that it is not the same as, and exists in contrast with, Buddhist praxis, which is oriented toward otherworldly aims. In the remainder of this chapter, I explain the content of lawkī pyinnya (and the lawkī/lawkottara dichotomy) before turning to an analysis of the political rumors of the 1990s.

In American gangster dialect, circa 1930 getting wise means wising up to the way the world really works. To be educated in Pound's terms is to realize that the world is run by gangs, that power is a symbiosis of public government, organized crime and private wealth with deep connections to both (P. D. Scott, Deep Politics, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996, 74); that the legitimated overworld of politics, multi-national corporations and international finance is linked in myriad ways the underworld, a situation that remains unchanged today. Pound's importance, even his nobility, lies in his unremitting attempt to wise us up and to promote a benign underworld of artists as the true bearers of culture in a world increasingly dominated by criminal greed. That this attempt led him astray politically and morally there can be no doubt, but his allegiance to Mussolini, his eventual anti-Semitism and his steady course rightwards from the mid-1930s onward, should not blind us to what he saw as his mission, which was nothing less than to save what was salvageable from the wreckage of twentieth-century Europe. Necessarily then, Pound's great work, The Cantos, is both the secret history of the world and a utopian program relying throughout on information and beliefs outside the mainstream. As many readers have noted the poem has aspects of a muck-raking project and as such is invested in secret history. By necessity, this aspect of history in the poem is documented throughout by evidence culled from unofficial and in many cases apocryphal sources that compromise the integrity of his epic project. The most obvious of these are The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which enter the source field of the poem relatively late, in The Pisan Cantos, but this notorious forgery will not be discussed here. Rather, this essay connects Pound's concept of the great bass, which he articulates in Guide to Kulchur to Peter Dale Scott's thinking about deep politics and parapolitics - concepts that have a clear relevance to the idea of secret history. © 2008 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960110594"

This development was and is supported by the increasing vulnerability of industrial societies (e.g., due to nuclear power plants and terrorists' attacks, e.g., in the Far East or 9/11). These tendencies influenced not only political decisions but the course of everyday life as well. As those events are extreme and rare, the psychological consequences and processes involved are so far relatively unknown. We discuss a possible framework for explaining these new developments by feasible psychological theories. A suitable approach is the Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). According to CPT, rationality is defined in respect to subjective reference points rather than to general objective criteria. The possibilities of explaining and predicting different definitions of rationality by means of CPT are discussed. Other features of CPT relevant in this context are cognitive illusions like the representative heuristic and availability heuristic. These heuristics cause a subjective representation of events that is not appropriate according to rational criteria. Therefore, such biases explain why terror events appear to be a real harassment in everyday life even though they are statistically less likely to occur than other incidents (e.g., traffic accidents). We also discuss the possibility of explaining the psychological processing of information dealing with terror threats by other phenomena known in the psychology of heuristics, biases and errors that are not explicitly addressed in CPT. These are the so-called validity, misinformation and labeling effects, illusionary correlations and the peculiarities involved when flashbulb memories are processed. Finally, the subject area of the psychology of suggestion will be addressed as a possible framework for these theories, heuristics and effects. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is argued that the rigorous questioning of–and hence, confrontation with–dominant beliefs, perceptions, norms, standards, and rules embedded in a neo-liberal, corporate-aligned ‘democratic’ global order will, by its very nature, contribute to the demise of human misfortune and injustice. As a viable start, cultural studies should return to the basically moral project of inquiry into injustice, oppression, and deception, and concretely undertake to have global influence in a world that has fewer and fewer margins separating truth from myth. The so-called ‘industry of deception’ has stringently endeavoured, and continues to endeavour, to thwart the political awakening of Latin America's erstwhile dormant masses. As mandatory foot soldiers in imperialism's battle against this process of mass radicalisation, the dominant media have sought to preside over the voiceless by putting lies across as truths. In this manner the global media industry seeks to sustain imperialism's hegemony over not only the Latin American continent with its 500 million struggling subjects, but the great majority of the world's wretched masses. Contemporary developments in a range of Latin American countries–Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Venezuela, and others–show quite demonstratively the emergence of a new, radical political ethos amongst the continent's ordinary, struggling subjects, evoking both a measure of optimism amongst oppressed subjects elsewhere and overpowering responses from reactionary agents. By looking at the Latin American continent critically and truthfully, and more so, by contesting the ‘mechanisms of disinformation’, scholars of culture hopefully could reclaim their authentic purpose in the intellectual sphere and meaningfully contribute to the invention of another world. © 2009, Copyright Unisa Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860597867"

Subsequently, children were interviewed by either their parent or a ""parent stranger"" using either a standardized set of misleading or nonmisleading questions. Results revealed that children in the misleading condition were more suggestible when misinformation was introduced by a stranger than by their parents. However, in the nonmisleading condition, children reported a greater amount of both accurate and inaccurate information to their parents than to strangers. Differences in children's accuracy are explained in terms of children's familiarity and trust with interviewers and perceptions of interviewer credibility.

Next, individual participants described the accomplice and completed a target-absent photographic line-up task comprising blue-eyed members. Misinformed participants were several times more likely than controls to describe the accomplice as having blue eyes, and twice as likely to identify someone from the line-up. In Experiment 2, when line-up members' eye colour was digitally altered from blue to brown, the line-up effect disappeared, suggesting that the increase in identifications in Experiment 1 was not a generalised increase in willingness to choose from the line-up.

Both therapist and client bring beliefs into therapy, and the confirmation bias shows that people discover what they already believe to be true. What do people believe about memory? We asked 115 students for their reactions to various statements about how memory works; results showed widespread belief in the repression mechanism. A principal components analysis revealed that three larger beliefs explained 61% of the variance in the more specific beliefs: possible sources of memory distortions, memory for traumatic events, and the potential recoverability of memories.

Five-year-olds, 7-year-olds and adults were shown a short video depicting a children's adventure and were asked a set of misleading questions to introduce misinformation one week later. Before the recognition memory test was administered another week later, half of the participants were given instructions to mentally reinstate the context of the misleading interview. Memory was assessed with a set of forced-choice recognition questions once in the misleading interview context and for the children a second time at home one week later. When participants were instructed to mentally reinstate the context of the misleading interview prior to the recognition test, false memory reports occurred more often for adults than for children and had a stronger impact on peripheral information than on central information for both 7-year-olds and adults. When 5- and 7-year-olds were tested at home, false memory reports decreased. Thus, reinstating the context of an interview introducing misinformation can reduce the accuracy of memory reports; the context dependence of both accurate and inaccurate memory reports in children and adults is discussed.

The level of sexual knowledge was determined from 14 content based questions, for example questions about sexually transmitted infections, gender, sexual orientation, and other reproductive health topics. Additionally, Indiana adults were surveyed about their beliefs regarding certain sources of influence over young peoples' sexual values. Key findings of the research indicate that adults in Indiana do not have accurate information about sexuality and seem to have wide-spread sexualityrelated misperceptions and misinformation.

They found that the participants' endorsement levels across three types of disorders (autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], and dyslexia) varied but not in a consistent manner, with only a few noticeable trends across interventions. Furthermore, respondents tended to endorse interventions, whether evidence-based or not, without admitted prior exposure to information about them. The results suggest that more attention should be paid to teaching critical evaluation skills as a part of preliminary training of future educators.

The present study examined whether an individual's beliefs in the quality of their memory, relative to another person's, mediates susceptibility to memory conformity. Perceived encoding duration was manipulated by telling dyad members that one person had encoded a set of pictures for either half or twice as long as their partner. In fact, actual encoding duration was the same for all participants. Dyad members each encoded slightly different versions of otherwise identical pictures and discussed them prior to an individual free recall test. Participants who believed that they had encoded the pictures for half as long as their partner were more susceptible to memory conformity, as indicated by their increased tendency to report errant items at test that had been encountered from their partner rather than items that they had actually seen. This effect of perceived encoding duration on memory conformity was mediated through response order. A source monitoring test found that these unseen items were errantly attributed to the pictures approximately 50% of the time.

A large number of methods designed to extract such information from direct reports provided by examinees have been developed over the last 50 years. Most methods require modifications in test instructions, response modes, and scoring rules. These testing methods are reviewed and the results of a large-scale empirical study of the most promising among them are reported. Seven testing methods were applied to MC tests from four different content areas using a between-persons design. To identify the most efficient methods and the optimal conditions for their application, the results were analyzed with respect to six different criteria. The results showed a surprisingly large tendency on the part of the examinees to take advantage of the special features of the alternative methods and indicated that, on average, high ability examinees were better judges of their level of knowledge and, consequently, could benefit more from these methods. Systematic interactions were found between the testing method and the test content, indicating that no method was uniformly superior.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031533459"

Two experiments examined the nature of these 'social' influences, and whether their persistence is independent of their accuracy. Experiment 1 found that a confederate's social proximity, as well as the content and the confidence of their utterances, interactively modulates participants' immediate conformity. Notably, errant confederate statements that 'lied' about encoded material had a particularly strong immediate distorting influence on memory judgements. Experiment 2 revealed that these 'lies' were also memorable, continuing a day later to impair memory accuracy, while accurate confederate statements failed to produce a corresponding and lasting beneficial effect on memory. These findings suggest that an individual's 'informational' social influence can be selectively heightened when they express misinformation to someone who suspects no deceptive intent. The methods newly introduced here thus allow multiple social and cognitive factors impinging on memory accuracy to be manipulated and examined during realistic, precisely controlled dyadic social interactions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Relations between misinformation acceptance and compliance were also examined. The classic three-stage misinformation paradigm (Loftus, 1979) was employed, with a multi-component recognition test added. Either immediately or 2 weeks after viewing a distressing film, 232 adults read a narrative (misleading or control) about the murder and then took a recognition test that tapped memory for central and peripheral details. Test-item order either matched the chronology of the film or was randomly determined. Significant misinformation effects were obtained. Moreover, control participants were more accurate in response to questions about central than peripheral information; however, this was not so for misinformed participants. Sequential but not random retrieval order resulted in a higher proportion of correct responses for central as opposed to peripheral misinformation questions. Compliance was significantly related to misinformation effects. Delay increased participants' suggestibility, impaired memory accuracy, and produced higher confidence ratings for misinformed participants compared to controls. Findings indicate that even for a highly negative event, adults' memory is not immune to inaccuracies and suggestive influences.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-37749017721"

Reliability coefficients do not do this, being dependent on the spread of examinee attainment. Better in this regard is a measure produced by dividing the standard error of measurement by the test's 'reliability length', the latter defined as the maximum possible score minus the most probable score obtainable by blind guessing alone. This, however, can be unsatisfactory with negative marking (formula scoring), as shown by data on 13 negatively marked true/false tests. In these the examinees displayed considerable misinformation, which correlated negatively with correct knowledge. Negative marking can improve test reliability by penalizing such misinformation as well as by discouraging guessing. Reliability measures can be based on idealized theoretical models instead of on test data. These do not reflect the qualities of the test items, but can be focused on specific test objectives (e.g. in relation to cut-off scores) and can be expressed as easily communicated statements even before tests are written. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750631099"

Respondents possessed similar knowledge of age-related trends in suggestibility the positive effects of a pre-misinformation warning, and the negative influence of longer delays between the event/ misinformation and event/final memory test. Compared to experts, laypeople underestimated the size of suggestibility differences between age groups and lacked knowledge about how event detail centrality, witness participation, and source prestige can increase witness suggestibility. Laypeople rated themselves as being largely unfamiliar with witness suggestibility research and thought that expert testimony would be beneficial.

The presentation of misleading faces between encoding and retrieval led to more false alarms and fewer hits, regardless of age. Adults were more conservative than children in their selection of faces, and thus, their number of correct hits was exceeded by children. However, adults outperformed children on face identification in terms of providing more correct rejections.

However, the norms also make such regulation difficult to achieve. One barrier is a deep suspicion of modern medicine and medical practitioners, who are not seen as reliable sources of information. This suspicion is reinforced when the quality of health services is inadequate. Among urban Aymara, the level of acceptability of most modern methods of contraception is low. Many would prefer to use traditional methods, even when use of these methods entails considerable sacrifice and risk of conflict with their partners, unwanted pregnancies, and recourse to unsafe abortion. -Authors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028665691"

This study tests the hypothesis that rumor involvement can have a negative and independent impact on pill usage by focusing on a common misbelief that the pill causes 'weakness'. The data comes from a 1981-1982 national self-weighted sample survey of 3283 currently married men and women dealing with family planning and mass media behaviors. The analyses confirm that rumor involvement decreases the probability of current or future pill use by previous users and by those who have never used it. Correct knowledge about the pill is shown to enhance pill usage as do other determinants such as social support for birth control and the desire for no more children. The importance of providing strong contraceptive education programs giving deeper consideration to contraceptive and related health beliefs in delivering fertility regulation services is highlighted. © 1986.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022554905"

In this article we briefly review the literature on memory accuracy in healthy older adults. The prevailing evidence indicates that, compared to younger adults, older adults exhibit both diminished memory accuracy and greater susceptibility to misinformation. In addition, older adults demonstrate high levels of confidence in their false memories. We suggest an explanatory framework for the high level of false memories observed in older adults, a framework based on the theory that consciously controlled uses of memory decline with age, making older adults more susceptible to false memories that rely on automatic processes. We also point to future research that may remedy such deficits in accuracy. Copyright © 2006 Association for Psychological Science.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33646748057"

This ""filling-in"" may often result in misinformation, or the belief in incorrect information (as distinguished from a simple lack of information, or ignorance). Widespread misinformation among the electorate changes our conception of democracy as a ""marketplace of ideas,"" and may have much more serious consequences than does a broad lack of information or sophistication on the part of the electorate. Data from a 1997 random-digit-dial survey of 810 adults residing in San Diego was used to test the hypothesis that listening to political talk radio leads to higher levels of both information (regarding non-ideologically charged facts) and misinformation (regarding ideologically charged facts). Analysis revealed that active listening (not only listening but also calling and/or taking action because of talk radio) corresponded to higher levels of information, regardless of the ideological nature of the talk radio programs to which the listeners were exposed. However, greater frequency of exposure to conservative talk radio independently corresponded to greater misinformation, while greater exposure to moderate programming was associated with being less misinformed, controlling for partisanship, ideology, and a number of other predictors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0040629456"

The extended algorithm approach yielded some improvement in estimation performance. Subjects trained in algorithmic decomposition were able to produce algorithms, the effectiveness of which were dependent upon the presence of misinformation about components of the quantity to be estimated.

In this case-study-style analysis, the problematic ways in which the popular media frame issues related to reproductive justice are explored. In both popular music and television series, reproduction is framed in ways that limit reproductive justice for women. Women who actively choose to use birth control are portrayed negatively, misinformation about condoms and access to reproductive healthcare is perpetuated, and stereotypes about women and reproduction are reinforced. Based upon these analyses, it is recommended that further systematic content analyses be performed in addition to experimental work on the effects of media framing on support (or lack of support) for policies related to reproductive justice. It is also suggested that different types of media related to women's reproduction might be used to help young men and women develop skills for critically deconstructing and reframing messages about sex and reproduction put forth by various forms of media.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-61549097132"

Is Cuba ruled by a totalitarian, Stalinist regime? Have the Cuban people surrendered their basic liberties, even though they might have achieved their equality? How is the concept of democracy perceived and practised on the island? In terms of freedom of speech, what are the deeper meanings and implications of Castro's enduring cultural decree: within the revolution, everything, against the revolution, nothing? Since the capitalist system is based on a ‘philosophy of selfishness and brutal competition’, is it able to resolve the problems of today's world? In this regard, the article brings ‘socialism’ back into the equation, contending that it has remained fundamentally relevant in a world typified by exceeding levels of deprivation, conflict and partition. Revolutionary Cuba, in effect, has come to embrace a distinctly humanistic socialist belief system, portrayed, for example, in its unremitting concrete expression of internationalism and universal solidarity. As the supreme (prior) leader of the revolution, Castro himself is particularly recognised for his abhorrence of human prejudice, marginalisation and discrimination–an ethical framework that is manifested in Cuba's official position on race and racism. For obvious reasons, this distinguishing philosophy can be considered highly significant and appropriate to all spheres of South African society. In sum, the article sustains Fidel Castro's counter argument that the current global economic order–imposed by capitalism-imperialism through both calculated, predatory means and veiled mechanism of disinformation–is not only ‘cruel, unfair, inhuman and contrary to the inevitable course of history, but also “inherently racist”’. © 2009, Copyright Unisa Press.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996467743"

Healthy development depends on both a propitious environment and the action of adolescents themselves. A stable family, peace, material conditions for physical health, and educational, social and vocational opportunities with a chance to make use of them before marriage, are necessary environment conditions. However, within this context the adolescent must experiment with new behaviours and relationships inevitably courting some risks. Adolescent health is especially linked to behaviour. If the environment is inadequate or dangerous and the adolescent lacks self-esteem, behaviours dangerous to health are more likely to occur. These include: precocious and unprotected sexual behaviour sometimes resulting in too early or unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; injuries arising accidentally from risk taking behaviours especially when combined with alcohol or drugs; intentional injury whether self-inflicted or inflicted by others; and poor eating and habits of hygiene leading to obesity, or emaciation, acne and poor teeth and gums. Adolescent behaviour is often governed by their beliefs about what others think. Two way communication in a trusting atmosphere will reduce myths and misinformation and encourage healthy behaviour. The promotion of health, the prevention of problems, and their treatment and rehabilitation when they arise can best be accomplished with the active co-operation of young people. © 1989.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024395436"

In this case, using marketing to drive journalistic decision results in a poorly informed electorate in which a comedy program of admitted fake news provides more insight into the truth of politicians' statements than do actual television news shows. Design/methodology/approach The starting-point is the fake news program on a comedy network, whose show host himself generated news during the election season with confrontations and criticisms of journalists who failed to do their reporting job. Findings The journalists, according to Stewart, have come to serve theater and the illusion of objectivity instead of the truth. When marketing drives journalism decisions, the public loses. Practical implications This abuse and misuse of marketing for news programming decisions lower the credibility of all news and information, and the dedicated journalists in the professions should take Jon Stewart's criticisms as a call to action. People from the USA need to be better informed about the world instead of having their own continued biases and misperceptions fed by pundits. At worst, this is a misleading selling of news as a commodity instead of informing the public.

It is shown that misinformation always and necessarily results in expected item scores lower than those associated with complete igno rance. Moreover, it is shown that some re sponse/scoring methods penalize all conditions of misinformation equally, and others have varying penalties according to the number of wrong choices the misinformed examinee has categorized with the correct choice. One method exacts the greatest pen alty when a specific wrong choice is believed cor rect; two other methods provide the maximum pen alty when the examinee is confident only that the correct choice is incorrect.

It was assumed that such attitudes are under influence of both cognitive processes and more general attitudinal structures. The hypothesized model was tested against empirical data from a nation-wide survey of Norwegian adults, including 543 males and 577 females. The proposed model fit the data reasonably well. As expressed by total effect education was the most important predictor of AIDS policy attitudes. However, the most notable finding appeared to be the strong direct effect exerted by attitudes towards minorities. Misinformation about AIDS transmission and sexual attitudes also exerted significant direct effects upon AIDS policy attitudes. The results clearly demonstrate that AIDS policy attitudes are not cognitively based alone but also reflect more general attitudinal structures. Thus choosing a strategy which is primarily based on increasing the flow of factual AIDS information in order to remedy casual contact beliefs, will not be sufficient to prevent stigmatized and negative AIDS attitudes. This is more evident in that beliefs about modes of AIDS transmission, as reported in this study, seem themselves to have a symbolic component. A perspective which includes the idea of the value expressive fuctions of AIDS related attitudes seem relevant. Consequently, educational strategies which directly address prejudiced attitudes towards minority groups may prove particularly appropriate in the prevention of stigmatized and restrictive AIDS attitudes. © 1995.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028923832"

Upon testing for memory performance 24 h later, participants exposed to misinformation accepted the misinformation as part of their memory of the events in the videos. In both experiments, confidence judgments of participants subjected to misinformation were high and comparable to those of participants not subjected to misinformation. The relationship between accurate responding and confidence was assessed via calibration analysis [Yates, J. F. (1990). Judgments and decision making. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall].

They account for the largest proportion of new HIV diagnoses and AIDS-related deaths in this country; more than half of them are men who have sex with men (MSM). Prevention efforts to stem the spread of this disease have been severely hampered by stigmatization and misinformation about MSM culture and identity. Their focus has been on labels such as “gay” or “down low” rather than on behaviors and, much to the detriment of African Americans, has avoided gender identity. A popular argument for negative attitudes about MSM has been that their male identity is somehow incomplete or flawed, that their sexual identity somehow diminishes and skews their personal identity as men. This perceived incompleteness has been used to justify exclusion and perpetuate disparities in health care and disease prevalence. It has been found that cultural beliefs about masculine identity influence health behaviors among men and as such can contribute to strategies to improve death and combat disease. This article is part of a larger exploration of meaning, identity, and risk that examined and described cultural beliefs of 20 African American MSM in Detroit, MI, using ethnographic methods. Its rationale was that in order to understand sexuality involving two men it was essential to understand the designation of “man” itself. Toward that end, participants responded to the question “What does it mean to be a man?” Data analysis was driven by key characteristics and revealed four significant categories of meaning, i.e. personal character, social expectations, sexuality, and biology. Findings suggest that African American MSM share traditional Western beliefs about gender regardless of their public persona. Prevention efforts with gender as a point of departure may be more effective among African American MSM than those grounded in sexual orientation. This information offers valuable insight into the design and implement of programs to improve health among this group. © 2009 The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010789688"

Results indicate that the Sexual Beliefs and Information Questionnaire (SBIQ) had adequate test-retest reliability and is an internally consistent measure of sexual knowledge and beliefs. Most individuals had adequate knowledge regarding sexual functioning as indicated by correct responses to most items; however, there were several items missed more often than expected. Exploratory factor analysis suggests an underlying five-factor structure of the SBIQ. Scores were not correlated with years of education, mood, or marital satisfaction.

Unbiased questions produced lower levels of correct and higher levels of incorrect responses than did misleading questions. Correct free recall for central items declined and incorrect free recall for noncentral items increased over sessions. Recognition accuracy for noncentral items was lower for children who were given their first recognition test at 2 weeks as opposed to 6 weeks, and kindergarten children given misleading questions increased the number of recognition errors they made from their initial (2 week) to their final recognition test.

Although initially employed in South Africa for colonial propaganda, under apartheid the medium was used both to expose and resist state oppression. When the HIV/AIDS pandemic began in the 1980s, western film-makers harnessed the documentary format in order to foster awareness and challenge misinformation about the disease. This was also the case in South Africa, which saw the construction and perpetuation of numerous harmful myths about HIV/AIDS in tandem with rapidly increasing rates of transmission from the early 1990s. While government ineptitude meant that public education about the disease was severely lacking until the closing years of the century, numerous films were produced, often with corporate sponsorship, in order to educate the public about modes of transmission, prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. This article analyses the content and meaning of these films, which provide important insights into the historical development of social perceptions of the disease. Born of the racially polarised and politically volatile climate of the 1990s, prejudicial and stigmatising images were presented in many of the documentaries under review. Racism and homophobia were particularly evident. Their verbal and visual depiction is discussed in the first section of this article. The responses of successive South African governments to the pandemic, alongside its evaluation in the documentaries, is the subject of the second section. Lastly, the portrayal of gender in these films is explored, with particular attention to the themes of female vulnerability and male recalcitrance.

We refer to this as the misinformation effect. In four experiments, involving 570 subjects, we explored the role that discrepancy detection plays in the misinformation effect. Experiment 1 showed that subjects who naturally read a post-event narrative more slowly were more resistant to the effects of misleading information contained in the narrative. In Experiment 2, subjects who naturally read more slowly were more likely to detect a discrepancy between what they were reading and what was stored in their memory. In Experiment 3, subjects who were instructed to read slowly were more likely to detect a discrepancy than were those who were instructed to read quickly. In Experiment 4, subjects who were instructed to read slowly were more resistant to misleading postevent information. Taken together, these results suggest that longer reading times are associated with a greater scrutiny of postevent information.

Forty 4-year-olds participated in play activities with a research assistant. Each child was then interviewed either by the child′s own mother or by an unfamiliar female. Interviewers were instructed to find out what happened (free interview), but half of the interviewers were misled (biased) about the play activities prior to the interview. To examine how accurately adults recount children′s reports, the interviewers were asked to write postinterview descriptions of the play session. Children were then questioned by the interviewer again, who asked a predetermined set of questions (structured interview). Analyses revealed that during the free interview, questioning styles of mothers and strangers differed in several ways: mothers were more task-oriented, whereas strangers spent more time building rapport and were more open-ended in their approach. Biased compared to unbiased interviewers asked more questions about the misinformation provided. Children′s free recall accuracy suffered (e.g., they minimized what occurred, made more order errors) when they were interviewed by biased versus unbiased strangers but not when interviewed by biased versus unbiased mothers. The interviewers′ descriptions of the children′s experiences were generally correct, although mothers reported more correct details than strangers about certain categories of information. Exposure to the biasing misinformation led to greater inaccuracy in interviewers′ descriptions. During the structured interview, children were less susceptible to suggestions of abuse when questioned by their mothers than by strangers.

By the 1960s the consensus had fragmented under the weight of these contradictions, and new politically active groups emerged. With the growing realization that containing communism had made the United States appear increasingly like its enemy, with domestic surveillance, purges, and disinformation generating a credibility gap, the moral certitude of the cold war consensus faded into increasing ambiguity. This ambiguity, emergent in the 1950s and apparent to very close reading in High Noon and The Tin Star, becomes clearer by 1959 (Warlock) and loses all semblance of subtlety by 1968 (Firecreek). The articulation of these various elements-cultural consensus, government, youth, and gender-reveals in these films a growing discomfort with American cultural norms, ambiguity about moral action, and increasing doubt that moral action is possible within the American community.

The first phase of the research developed the Implicit Memory Theory Scale (IMTS). The exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors that were converted into three subscales of the 37-item measure. Cronbach a coefficients and test-retest correlations showed acceptable to high reliability for the global scale and three subscales. Validation studies indicated that the scale was sensitive to individual differences in professional knowledge of autobiographical memory and manipulation that involved providing respondents with this kind of knowledge.

Yet wetlands (marshes, bogs, swamps, carrs and river meadows) are greatly threatened habitats for which education is not stemming a tide of destruction. Underlying this is a low perception of their value as natural systems by an adult community that regards them as undesirable, dangerous places. This perception may be innate, the product of long evolutionary association with the negative aspects of wetlands such as disease and impenetrability. Or it may arise simply by learned conditioning, ultimately based on common sense but, in the technological world, at least, no longer justified. A test of these hypotheses ‐innate versus conditioned perception ‐was carried out by gathering the views of 183 children aged 6/7 (top infants) and 10/11 (top juniors) in three schools. An innate perception would mean that perception of wetlands was highly negative from the outset and stayed much the same or even improved with age and experience. A conditioned response might be indicated by a view that became more negative with age. Data were gathered by means of a questionnaire in which the children chose adjectives they associated with particular animals or habitats and an interview in which they were shown pictures of habitats and asked for their reactions. Perceptions of infants towards bogs and marshes were consistently more positive than those of juniors whilst perceptions of woodlands improved with age. Perceptions of a variety of animals did not change with age and were much as might be expected, lending credibility to the findings concerning habitats. It is concluded that conditioning leads to negative adult perceptions of wetlands. This conditioning may come from literature, television or orally and it is not possible to rank these sources. However, a wealth of evidence does suggest that wetlands are negatively portrayed in junior and adult fiction but more positively in that written for infants. Teachers of juniors may thus have a key role to play in the conservation of wetlands by attempting positively to counteract the insidious influences of sources of misinformation. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-3042980778"

The authors examined the effect of cross-examination on the accuracy of 5- and 6-year-old children's (N = 46) reports of a contrived event. Consistent with prior research, children made changes to their original responses during cross-examination. Furthermore, these changes occurred irrespective of original accuracy. Finally, prior exposure to misleading information did not affect children's responses to cross-examination. Even children with no prior exposure to misinformation altered their original responses, decreasing their ultimate levels of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that cross-examination style questioning is inappropriate for young children.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0242266121"

Eighty-six three- to four-year-olds and five- to six-year-olds observed an event either in real life or on video. Immediately afterward, they freely recalled the event and answered misleading questions about central and descriptive information. Three- to four-year-olds in the video condition were less likely to accurately recall descriptive information than three- to four-year-olds in the live condition and five- to six-year-olds in either condition. Children in the video condition were less accurate in response to misleading questions than those in the live condition. When video condition three- to four-year-olds in Experiment 2 were asked nonmisleading questions that prompted them for descriptive information, they recalled descriptors less accurately than those in the live condition. These results have particularly important implications for studies that utilize video events when investigating children's eyewitness memory.

For example, claims that Iraqi forces executed coalition prisoners of war after they surrendered were retracted the day after the claims were made. Similarly, tentative initial reports about the discovery of weapons of mass destruction were all later disconfirmed. We investigated the effects of these retractions and disconfirmations on people's memory for and beliefs about war-related events in two coalition countries (Australia and the United States) and one country that opposed the war (Germany). Participants were queried about (a) true events, (b) events initially presented as fact but subsequently retracted, and (c) fictional events. Participants in the United States did not show sensitivity to the correction of misinformation, whereas participants in Australia and Germany discounted corrected misinformation. Our results are consistent with previous findings in that the differences between samples reflect greater suspicion about the motives underlying the war among people in Australia and Germany than among people in the United States.

Children (3 to 8 years old) participated in science demonstrations, listened to their parents read a story that described experienced and nonexperienced events, and subsequently discussed the science experience in two follow-up interviews. Many children described fictitious events in response to open-ended prompts, and there were no age differences in suggestibility during this phase of the interview. Accuracy declined markedly in response to direct questions, especially for the younger children. Although the older children retracted many of their false reports after receiving source-monitoring instructions, the younger children did not. Path analyses indicated that acquiescence, free recall, and source monitoring all contribute to mediating patterns of suggestibility across age. Results indicate that judgments about the accuracy of children's testimony must consider the possibility of exposure to misinformation prior to formal interviews.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047681301"

Much of the debate has been clouded by neglect of the role of misinformation and by vagueness regarding both the specification of test types and 'partial knowledge' in relation to guessing. Moreover, variations in risk-taking in the face of negative marking have too often been treated in absolute terms rather than in relation to the effect of guessing on test unreliability. Objectives: This paper aims to clarify these points and to compare the ill-effects on test reliability of guessing and of variable risk-taking. Methods: Three published studies on medical students are examined. These compare responses in true/false tests obtained with both negative marking and number-right scoring. The studies yield data on misinformation and on the extent to which students may fail to benefit from distrusted partial knowledge when there is negative marking. A simple statistical model is used to compare variations in risk-taking with test unreliability due to blind guessing under number-right scoring conditions. Conclusions: Partial knowledge should be least problematic with independent true/false items. The effect on test reliability of blind guessing under number-right conditions is generally greater than that due to the over-cautiousness of some students when there is negative marking.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036398474"
